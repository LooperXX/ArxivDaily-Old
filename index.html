                                        <span>The interest in demographic information retrieval based on text data has
increased in the research community because applications have shown success in
different sectors such as security, marketing, heath-care, and others.
Recognition and identification of demographic traits such as gender, age,
location, or personality based on text data can help to improve different
marketing strategies. For instance it makes it possible to segment and to
personalize offers, thus products and services are exposed to the group of
greatest interest. This type of technology has been discussed widely in
documents from social media. However, the methods have been poorly studied in
data with a more formal structure, where there is no access to emoticons,
mentions, and other linguistic phenomena that are only present in social media.
This paper proposes the use of recurrent and convolutional neural networks, and
a transfer learning strategy for gender recognition in documents that are
written in informal and formal languages. Models are tested in two different
databases consisting of Tweets and call-center conversations. Accuracies of up
to 75\% are achieved for both databases. The results also indicate that it is
possible to transfer the knowledge from a system trained on a specific type of
expressions or idioms such as those typically used in social media into a more
formal type of text data, where the amount of data is more scarce and its
structure is completely different.</span>

defines a joint probabilistic distribution over all possible proof graphs and

on multiple datasets under diverse settings (fully supervised, few-shot and

10%-30% improvement on QA accuracy in few/zero-shot evaluation. Our codes and

                                        <span>We study the problem of building entity tagging systems by using a few rules
as weak supervision. Previous methods mostly focus on disambiguation entity
types based on contexts and expert-provided rules, while assuming entity spans
are given. In this work, we propose a novel method TALLOR that bootstraps
high-quality logical rules to train a neural tagger in a fully automated
manner. Specifically, we introduce compound rules that are composed from simple
rules to increase the precision of boundary detection and generate more diverse
pseudo labels. We further design a dynamic label selection strategy to ensure
pseudo label quality and therefore avoid overfitting the neural tagger.
Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other
weakly supervised methods and even rivals a state-of-the-art distantly
supervised tagger with a lexicon of over 2,000 terms when starting from only 20
simple rules. Our method can serve as a tool for rapidly building taggers in
emerging domains and tasks. Case studies show that learned rules can
potentially explain the predicted entities.</span>

                                        <span>While self-supervised learning has made rapid advances in natural language
processing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in
resource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law,
puzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain
pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be
unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that
existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when
domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case
Holdings On Legal Decisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple
choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset
presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and
difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second,
we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While
a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books
and Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (using corpus of
approximately 3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than
BERT&#x27;s) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial
performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12%
improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal
tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task
exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of
performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain
specificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage
resource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures,
too, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language.</span>

                                        <span>Decades of research on climate have provided a consensus that human activity
has changed the climate and we are currently heading into a climate crisis.
While public discussion and research efforts on climate change mitigation have
increased, potential solutions need to not only be discussed but also
effectively deployed. For preventing mismanagement and holding policy makers
accountable, transparency and degree of information about government processes
have been shown to be crucial. However, currently the quantity of information
about climate change discussions and the range of sources make it increasingly
difficult for the public and civil society to maintain an overview to hold
politicians accountable.

In response, we propose a multi-source topic aggregation system (MuSTAS)
which processes policy makers speech and rhetoric from several publicly
available sources into an easily digestible topic summary. MuSTAS uses novel
multi-source hybrid latent Dirichlet allocation to model topics from a variety
of documents. This topic digest will serve the general public and civil society
in assessing where, how, and when politicians talk about climate and climate
policies, enabling them to hold politicians accountable for their actions to
mitigate climate change and lack thereof.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks have achieved success in a wide array of perceptual tasks but
often fail at tasks involving both perception and higher-level reasoning. On
these more challenging tasks, bespoke approaches (such as modular symbolic
components, independent dynamics models or semantic parsers) targeted towards
that specific type of task have typically performed better. The downside to
these targeted approaches, however, is that they can be more brittle than
general-purpose neural networks, requiring significant modification or even
redesign according to the particular task at hand. Here, we propose a more
general neural-network-based approach to dynamic visual reasoning problems that
obtains state-of-the-art performance on three different domains, in each case
outperforming bespoke modular approaches tailored specifically to the task. Our
method relies on learned object-centric representations, self-attention and
self-supervised dynamics learning, and all three elements together are required
for strong performance to emerge. The success of this combination suggests that
there may be no need to trade off flexibility for performance on problems
involving spatio-temporal or causal-style reasoning. With the right soft biases
and learning objectives in a neural network we may be able to attain the best
of both worlds.</span>

                                        <span>Schema-based event extraction is a critical technique to apprehend the
essential content of events promptly. With the rapid development of deep
learning technology, event extraction technology based on deep learning has
become a research hotspot. Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics
have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and
updated survey. This paper fills the gap by reviewing the state-of-the-art
approaches, focusing on deep learning-based models. We summarize the task
definition, paradigm, and models of schema-based event extraction and then
discuss each of these in detail. We introduce benchmark datasets that support
tests of predictions and evaluation metrics. A comprehensive comparison between
different techniques is also provided in this survey. Finally, we conclude by

                                        <span>Online hate speech is a recent problem in our society that is rising at a
steady pace by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the corresponding regimes that
characterise most social media platforms. This phenomenon is primarily fostered
by offensive comments, either during user interaction or in the form of a
posted multimedia context. Nowadays, giant corporations own platforms where
millions of users log in every day, and protection from exposure to similar
phenomena appears to be necessary in order to comply with the corresponding
legislation and maintain a high level of service quality. A robust and reliable
system for detecting and preventing the uploading of relevant content will have
a significant impact on our digitally interconnected society. Several aspects
of our daily lives are undeniably linked to our social profiles, making us
vulnerable to abusive behaviours. As a result, the lack of accurate hate speech
detection mechanisms would severely degrade the overall user experience,
although its erroneous operation would pose many ethical concerns. In this
paper, we present &#x27;ETHOS&#x27;, a textual dataset with two variants: binary and
multi-label, based on YouTube and Reddit comments validated using the
Figure-Eight crowdsourcing platform. Furthermore, we present the annotation
protocol used to create this dataset: an active sampling procedure for
balancing our data in relation to the various aspects defined. Our key
assumption is that, even gaining a small amount of labelled data from such a
time-consuming process, we can guarantee hate speech occurrences in the
examined material.</span>

                                        <span>There is currently a gap between the natural language expression of scholarly
publications and their structured semantic content modeling to enable
intelligent content search. With the volume of research growing exponentially
every year, a search feature operating over semantically structured content is
compelling. The SemEval-2021 Shared Task NLPContributionGraph (a.k.a. &#x27;the NCG
task&#x27;) tasks participants to develop automated systems that structure
contributions from NLP scholarly articles in the English language. Being the
first-of-its-kind in the SemEval series, the task released structured data from
NLP scholarly articles at three levels of information granularity, i.e. at
sentence-level, phrase-level, and phrases organized as triples toward Knowledge
Graph (KG) building. The sentence-level annotations comprised the few sentences
about the article&#x27;s contribution. The phrase-level annotations were scientific
term and predicate phrases from the contribution sentences. Finally, the
triples constituted the research overview KG. For the Shared Task,
participating systems were then expected to automatically classify contribution
sentences, extract scientific terms and relations from the sentences, and
organize them as KG triples.

Overall, the task drew a strong participation demographic of seven teams and
27 participants. The best end-to-end task system classified contribution
sentences at 57.27% F1, phrases at 46.41% F1, and triples at 22.28% F1. While
the absolute performance to generate triples remains low, in the conclusion of
this article, the difficulty of producing such data and as a consequence of
modeling it is highlighted.</span>

support the role of attention-based explanations as a faithful and plausible
measure of salience. To investigate whether this approach is appropriate, we
compare LIME, Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT, Grad-SHAP, Deep-SHAP, and
attention-based explanations, applied to two neural architectures trained on
single- and pair-sequence language tasks. In most cases, we find that none of

                                        <span>Since visual perception can give rich information beyond text descriptions
for world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging
visual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted
attention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels
for language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from
approximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary
diversity of a small image-text dataset. To overcome these limitations, we
present VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation method for improving
language understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher model on a video-text
dataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student language model with a
text dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to use different
knowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a large-scale
video-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In our
experiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only language
models and vokenization models, on several downstream language understanding
tasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the improved world
knowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning capabilities of our model
by evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Lastly, we
present comprehensive ablation studies as well as visualizations of the learned
text-to-video grounding results of our teacher and student language models. Our
code and models are available at: https://github.com/zinengtang/VidLanKD</span>

reading-style (e.g., audiobook) speech, it is still challenging to synthesize
spontaneous-style speech (e.g., podcast or conversation), mainly because of two
reasons: 1) the lack of training data for spontaneous speech; 2) the difficulty
in modeling the filled pauses (um and uh) and diverse rhythms in spontaneous
speech. In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 3, an adaptive TTS system that
fine-tunes a well-trained reading-style TTS model for spontaneous-style speech.
Specifically, 1) to insert filled pauses (FP) in the text sequence
appropriately, we introduce an FP predictor to the TTS model; 2) to model the
varying rhythms, we introduce a duration predictor based on mixture of experts
(MoE), which contains three experts responsible for the generation of fast,
medium and slow speech respectively, and fine-tune it as well as the pitch
predictor for rhythm adaptation; 3) to adapt to other speaker timbre, we
fine-tune some parameters in the decoder with few speech data. To address the
challenge of lack of training data, we mine a spontaneous speech dataset to
support our research this work and facilitate future research on spontaneous
TTS. Experiments show that AdaSpeech 3 synthesizes speech with natural FP and
rhythms in spontaneous styles, and achieves much better MOS and SMOS scores
than previous adaptive TTS systems.</span>

                                        <span>Text-to-Speech synthesis systems are generally evaluated using Mean Opinion
Score (MOS) tests, where listeners score samples of synthetic speech on a
Likert scale. A major drawback of MOS tests is that they only offer a general
measure of overall quality-i.e., the naturalness of an utterance-and so cannot
tell us where exactly synthesis errors occur. This can make evaluation of the
appropriateness of prosodic variation within utterances inconclusive. To
address this, we propose a novel evaluation method based on the Rapid Prosody
Transcription paradigm. This allows listeners to mark the locations of errors
in an utterance in real-time, providing a probabilistic representation of the
perceptual errors that occur in the synthetic signal. We conduct experiments
that confirm that the fine-grained evaluation can be mapped to system rankings
of standard MOS tests, but the error marking gives a much more comprehensive
assessment of synthesized prosody. In particular, for standard audiobook test
set samples, we see that error marks consistently cluster around words at major
prosodic boundaries indicated by punctuation. However, for question-answer
based stimuli, where we control information structure, we see differences
emerge in the ability of neural TTS systems to generate context-appropriate
prosodic prominence.</span>

                                        <span>Modelling the process that a listener actuates in deriving the words intended
by a speaker requires setting a hypothesis on how lexical items are stored in
memory. This work aims at developing a system that imitates humans when
identifying words in running speech and, in this way, provide a framework to
better understand human speech processing. We build a speech recognizer for
Italian based on the principles of Stevens&#x27; model of Lexical Access in which
words are stored as hierarchical arrangements of distinctive features (Stevens,
K. N. (2002). &quot;Toward a model for lexical access based on acoustic landmarks
and distinctive features,&quot; J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 111(4):1872-1891). Over the
past few decades, the Speech Communication Group at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) developed a speech recognition system for English based on
this approach. Italian will be the first language beyond English to be
explored; the extension to another language provides the opportunity to test
the hypothesis that words are represented in memory as a set of
hierarchically-arranged distinctive features, and reveal which of the
underlying mechanisms may have a language-independent nature. This paper also
introduces a new Lexical Access corpus, the LaMIT database, created and labeled
specifically for this work, that will be provided freely to the speech research
community. Future developments will test the hypothesis that specific acoustic
discontinuities - called landmarks - that serve as cues to features, are
language independent, while other cues may be language-dependent, with powerful
implications for understanding how the human brain recognizes speech.</span>

                                        <span>Studies on online hate speech have mostly focused on the automated detection
of harmful messages. Little attention has been devoted so far to the
development of effective strategies to fight hate speech, in particular through
the creation of counter-messages. While existing manual scrutiny and
intervention strategies are time-consuming and not scalable, advances in
natural language processing have the potential to provide a systematic approach
to hatred management. In this paper, we introduce a novel ICT platform that NGO
operators can use to monitor and analyze social media data, along with a
counter-narrative suggestion tool. Our platform aims at increasing the
efficiency and effectiveness of operators&#x27; activities against islamophobia. We
test the platform with more than one hundred NGO operators in three countries
through qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Results show that NGOs favor
the platform solution with the suggestion tool, and that the time required to
produce counter-narratives significantly decreases.</span>

                                        <span>Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have
delivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and
discovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the
prior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet
distribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same
layer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose
sawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of
documents that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the
topics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are
represented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a
layer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic
embedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of
the layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares
components between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as
sawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is
constructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.
Experiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic
models on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document
representations.</span>

                                        <span>Human reasoning can often be understood as an interplay between two systems:
the intuitive and associative (&quot;System 1&quot;) and the deliberative and logical
(&quot;System 2&quot;). Neural sequence models -- which have been increasingly successful
at performing complex, structured tasks -- exhibit the advantages and failure
modes of System 1: they are fast and learn patterns from data, but are often
inconsistent and incoherent. In this work, we seek a lightweight, training-free
means of improving existing System 1-like sequence models by adding System
2-inspired logical reasoning. We explore several variations on this theme in
which candidate generations from a neural sequence model are examined for
logical consistency by a symbolic reasoning module, which can either accept or
reject the generations. Our approach uses neural inference to mediate between
the neural System 1 and the logical System 2. Results in robust story
generation and grounded instruction-following show that this approach can
increase the coherence and accuracy of neurally-based generations.</span>

                                        <span>Dialog acts can be interpreted as the atomic units of a conversation, more
fine-grained than utterances, characterized by a specific communicative
function. The ability to structure a conversational transcript as a sequence of
dialog acts -- dialog act recognition, including the segmentation -- is
critical for understanding dialog. We apply two pre-trained transformer models,
XLNet and Longformer, to this task in English and achieve strong results on
Switchboard Dialog Act and Meeting Recorder Dialog Act corpora with dialog act
segmentation error rates (DSER) of 8.4% and 14.2%. To understand the key
factors affecting dialog act recognition, we perform a comparative analysis of
models trained under different conditions. We find that the inclusion of a
broader conversational context helps disambiguate many dialog act classes,
especially those infrequent in the training data. The presence of punctuation
in the transcripts has a massive effect on the models&#x27; performance, and a
detailed analysis reveals specific segmentation patterns observed in its
absence. Finally, we find that the label set specificity does not affect dialog
act segmentation performance. These findings have significant practical
implications for spoken language understanding applications that depend heavily
on a good-quality segmentation being available.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.
However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3$\times$ as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\times$224
ImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images. The
models and source code will be released soon.</span>

                                        <span>Active learning promises to alleviate the massive data needs of supervised
machine learning: it has successfully improved sample efficiency by an order of
magnitude on traditional tasks like topic classification and object
recognition. However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5
models and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety
of active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To
understand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a
per-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of
examples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to
learn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external
knowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative
visualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon
responsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that
active learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of
collective outliers in the active learning pool decreases. We conclude with a
discussion and prescriptive recommendations for mitigating the effects of these
outliers in future work.</span>

sentiment-bearing text. However, the figurative and creative nature of sarcasm
poses a great challenge for affective computing systems performing sentiment
analysis. This article compiles and reviews the salient work in the literature
of automatic sarcasm detection. Thus far, three main paradigm shifts have
occurred in the way researchers have approached this task: 1) semi-supervised
pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, 2) use of hashtag-based
supervision, and 3) incorporation of context beyond target text. In this
article, we provide a comprehensive review of the datasets, approaches, trends,

automatic speech recognition (ASR). When using appropriate modeling units,
e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open
vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words
not seen during training, e.g., named entities, numbers or technical terms. To
alleviate this problem we supplement an end-to-end ASR system with a
word/phrase memory and a mechanism to access this memory to recognize the words
and phrases correctly. After the training of the ASR system, and when it has
already been deployed, a relevant word can be added or subtracted instantly
without the need for further training. In this paper we demonstrate that
through this mechanism our system is able to recognize more than 85% of newly
added words that it previously failed to recognize compared to a strong
baseline.</span>

demonstrate SOTA results in many NLP tasks, including non-topical
classification, such as genre identification. However, often these approaches
exhibit low reliability to minor alterations of the test texts. A related
probelm concerns topical biases in the training corpus, for example, the
prevalence of words on a specific topic in a specific genre can trick the genre
classifier to recognise any text on this topic in this genre. In order to
mitigate the reliability problem, this paper investigates techniques for
attacking genre classifiers to understand the limitations of the transformer
models and to improve their performance. While simple text attacks, such as
those based on word replacement using keywords extracted by tf-idf, are not
capable of deceiving powerful models like XLM-RoBERTa, we show that
embedding-based algorithms which can replace some of the most &#x60;&#x60;significant&#x27;&#x27;

analysis can give overall picture of the comments received against any event,
product, or activity. Usually, the comments/tweets are classified into two main
classes that are negative or positive. However, the negative comments are too
abstract to understand the basic reason or the context. organizations are
interested to identify the exact reason for the negativity. In this research
study, we hierarchically goes down into negative comments, and link them with
more classes. Tweets are extracted from social media sites such as Twitter and
Facebook. If the sentiment analysis classifies any tweet into negative class,
then we further try to associates that negative comments with more possible
negative classes. Based on expert opinions, the negative comments/tweets are

                                        <span>Ki67 is a significant biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer,
whose index can be evaluated by quantifying its expression in Ki67
immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images. However, quantitative analysis on
multi-source Ki67 images is yet a challenging task in practice due to
cross-domain distribution differences, which result from imaging variation,
staining styles, and lesion types. Many recent studies have made some efforts
on domain generalization (DG), whereas there are still some noteworthy
limitations. Specifically in the case of Ki67 images, learning invariant
representation is at the mercy of the insufficient number of domains and the
cell categories mismatching in different domains. In this paper, we propose a
novel method to improve DG by searching the domain-agnostic subnetwork in a
domain merging scenario. Partial model parameters are iteratively pruned
according to the domain gap, which is caused by the data converting from a
single domain into merged domains during training. In addition, the model is
optimized by fine-tuning on merged domains to eliminate the interference of
class mismatching among various domains. Furthermore, an appropriate
implementation is attained by applying the pruning method to different parts of
the framework. Compared with known DG methods, our method yields excellent
performance in multiclass nucleus recognition of Ki67 IHC images, especially in
the lost category cases. Moreover, our competitive results are also evaluated
on the public dataset over the state-of-the-art DG methods.</span>

image-specific: 1) They are exhaustively trained on datasets synthesized by
predefined blur kernels (\eg bicubic), regardless of the domain gap with test
images. 2) Their model weights are fixed during testing, which means that test
images with various degradations are super-resolved by the same set of weights.
However, degradations of real images are various and unknown (\ie blind SR). It
is hard for a single model to perform well in all cases. To address these
issues, we propose an online super-resolution (ONSR) method. It does not rely
on predefined blur kernels and allows the model weights to be updated according
to the degradation of the test image. Specifically, ONSR consists of two
branches, namely internal branch (IB) and external branch (EB). IB could learn
the specific degradation of the given test LR image, and EB could learn to
super resolve images degraded by the learned degradation. In this way, ONSR
could customize a specific model for each test image, and thus could be more
tolerant with various degradations in real applications. Extensive experiments
on both synthesized and real-world images show that ONSR can generate more

Networks (CNNs), as it fits well on the tensor computation for the convolution
operation. However, the receptive field in the human visual system is actually
isotropic like a circle. Motivated by this observation, we propose using circle
kernels with isotropic receptive fields for the convolution, and our training
takes approximately equivalent amount of calculation when compared with the
corresponding CNN with square kernels. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate
the rationality of circle kernels. We then propose a kernel boosting strategy
that integrates the circle kernels with square kernels for the training and
inference, and we further let the kernel size/radius be learnable during the
training. Note that we reparameterize the circle kernels or integrated kernels
before the inference, thus taking no extra computation as well as the number of
parameter overhead for the testing. Extensive experiments on several standard
datasets, ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, using the circle kernels or
integrated kernels on typical existing CNNs, show that our approach exhibits
highly competitive performance. Specifically, on ImageNet with standard data
augmentation, our approach dramatically boosts the performance of
MobileNetV3-Small by 5.20% top-1 accuracy and 3.39% top-5 accuracy, and boosts
the performance of MobileNetV3-Large by 2.16% top-1 accuracy and 1.18% top-5

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)

applications. Several recent works have demonstrated that L1/L2 is better than
the L1 norm when approximating the L0 norm to promote sparsity. Consequently,
we postulate that applying L1/L2 on the gradient is better than the classic
total variation (the L1 norm on the gradient) to enforce the sparsity of the
image gradient. To verify our hypothesis, we consider a constrained formulation
to reveal empirical evidence on the superiority of L1/L2 over L1 when
recovering piecewise constant signals from low-frequency measurements.
Numerically, we design a specific splitting scheme, under which we can prove
subsequential and global convergence for the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) under certain conditions. Experimentally, we demonstrate
visible improvements of L1/L2 over L1 and other nonconvex regularizations for
image recovery from low-frequency measurements and two medical applications of
MRI and CT reconstruction. All the numerical results show the efficiency of our
proposed approach.</span>

detection of fetal malformations which have potential long-term health impacts.
The level of skill required to diagnose such malformations from live ultrasound
during examination is high and resources for screening are often limited. We
present an interpretable, atlas-learning segmentation method for automatic
diagnosis of Hypo-plastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) from a single &#x60;4 Chamber
Heart&#x27; view image. We propose to extend the recently introduced
Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks (Atlas-ISTN) into a framework that
enables sensitising atlas generation to disease. In this framework we can
jointly learn image segmentation, registration, atlas construction and disease
prediction while providing a maximum level of clinical interpretability
compared to direct image classification methods. As a result our segmentation
allows diagnoses competitive with expert-derived manual diagnosis and yields an
AUC-ROC of 0.978 (1043 cases for training, 260 for validation and 325 for
testing).</span>

                                        <span>Super-resolution (SR) plays a crucial role in improving the image quality of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI produces multi-contrast images and can
provide a clear display of soft tissues. However, current super-resolution
methods only employ a single contrast, or use a simple multi-contrast fusion
mechanism, ignoring the rich relations among different contrasts, which are
valuable for improving SR. In this work, we propose a multi-stage integration
network (i.e., MINet) for multi-contrast MRI SR, which explicitly models the
dependencies between multi-contrast images at different stages to guide image
SR. In particular, our MINet first learns a hierarchical feature representation
from multiple convolutional stages for each of different-contrast image.
Subsequently, we introduce a multi-stage integration module to mine the
comprehensive relations between the representations of the multi-contrast
images. Specifically, the module matches each representation with all other
features, which are integrated in terms of their similarities to obtain an
enriched representation. Extensive experiments on fastMRI and real-world
clinical datasets demonstrate that 1) our MINet outperforms state-of-the-art
multi-contrast SR methods in terms of various metrics and 2) our multi-stage
integration module is able to excavate complex interactions among
multi-contrast features at different stages, leading to improved target-image
quality.</span>

the challenging task of disease classification using chest X-rays. Our study
shows that high performance in a computer vision task does not directly

speed up clinical judgments. While orthopantomogram is a first-line tool for
dental examinations, no existing work has explored the summarization of
findings from it. A finding summary has to find teeth in the imaging study and
label the teeth with several types of past treatments. To tackle the problem,
we developDeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional
segmentation and tooth localization, the latter of which is further refined by
a novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to
improve detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments
show high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall
AUC of 88.2% in detecting six types of findings. The proposed dental coherence
and weak supervision both are shown to improve DeepOPG by adding 5.9% and 0.4%

                                        <span>We describe a system for visually guided autonomous navigation of
under-canopy farm robots. Low-cost under-canopy robots can drive between crop
rows under the plant canopy and accomplish tasks that are infeasible for
over-the-canopy drones or larger agricultural equipment. However, autonomously
navigating them under the canopy presents a number of challenges: unreliable
GPS and LiDAR, high cost of sensing, challenging farm terrain, clutter due to
leaves and weeds, and large variability in appearance over the season and
across crop types. We address these challenges by building a modular system
that leverages machine learning for robust and generalizable perception from
monocular RGB images from low-cost cameras, and model predictive control for
accurate control in challenging terrain. Our system, CropFollow, is able to
autonomously drive 485 meters per intervention on average, outperforming a
state-of-the-art LiDAR based system (286 meters per intervention) in extensive
field testing spanning over 25 km.</span>

                                        <span>For a typical Scene Graph Generation (SGG) method, there is often a large gap
in the performance of the predicates&#x27; head classes and tail classes. This
phenomenon is mainly caused by the semantic overlap between different
predicates as well as the long-tailed data distribution. In this paper, a
Predicate Correlation Learning (PCL) method for SGG is proposed to address the
above two problems by taking the correlation between predicates into
consideration. To describe the semantic overlap between strong-correlated
predicate classes, a Predicate Correlation Matrix (PCM) is defined to quantify
the relationship between predicate pairs, which is dynamically updated to
remove the matrix&#x27;s long-tailed bias. In addition, PCM is integrated into a
Predicate Correlation Loss function ($L_{PC}$) to reduce discouraging gradients
of unannotated classes. The proposed method is evaluated on Visual Genome
benchmark, where the performance of the tail classes is significantly improved
when built on the existing methods.</span>

driven by an adversarial loss to learn domain discrepancies and improve
sim2real adaptation. Our experiments confirm that the proposed adaptation

                                        <span>Person re-identification (re-ID) under various occlusions has been a
long-standing challenge as person images with different types of occlusions
often suffer from misalignment in image matching and ranking. Most existing
methods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts
according to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment
approach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a
disentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID
without requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision.
Leveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via
global reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image
similarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined
semantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of
semantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a
decorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object
queries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate
interference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique
(CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID
features. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks
(Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves
superior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by
large margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC.</span>

after year, resulting in fake videos that are very difficult to distinguish

models, synthesis of document images containing multiple and complex object
layouts is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel approach, called
DocSynth, to automatically synthesize document images based on a given layout.
In this work, given a spatial layout (bounding boxes with object categories) as
a reference by the user, our proposed DocSynth model learns to generate a set
of realistic document images consistent with the defined layout. Also, this
framework has been adapted to this work as a superior baseline model for
creating synthetic document image datasets for augmenting real data during
training for document layout analysis tasks. Different sets of learning
objectives have been also used to improve the model performance.
Quantitatively, we also compare the generated results of our model with real
data using standard evaluation metrics. The results highlight that our model
can successfully generate realistic and diverse document images with multiple
objects. We also present a comprehensive qualitative analysis summary of the
different scopes of synthetic image generation tasks. Lastly, to our knowledge
this is the first work of its kind.</span>

                                        <span>This paper considers deep visual recognition on long-tailed data. To be
general, we consider two applied scenarios, \ie, deep classification and deep
metric learning. Under the long-tailed data distribution, the majority classes
(\ie, tail classes) only occupy relatively few samples and are prone to lack of
within-class diversity. A radical solution is to augment the tail classes with
higher diversity. To this end, we introduce a simple and reliable method named
Memory-based Jitter (MBJ). We observe that during training, the deep model
constantly changes its parameters after every iteration, yielding the
phenomenon of \emph{weight jitters}. Consequentially, given a same image as the
input, two historical editions of the model generate two different features in
the deeply-embedded space, resulting in \emph{feature jitters}. Using a memory
bank, we collect these (model or feature) jitters across multiple training
iterations and get the so-called Memory-based Jitter. The accumulated jitters
enhance the within-class diversity for the tail classes and consequentially
improves long-tailed visual recognition. With slight modifications, MBJ is
applicable for two fundamental visual recognition tasks, \emph{i.e.}, deep
image classification and deep metric learning (on long-tailed data). Extensive
experiments on five long-tailed classification benchmarks and two deep metric
learning benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement. Moreover, the achieved
performance are on par with the state of the art on both tasks.</span>

automated vehicles. The recent publication of the SemanticKITTI dataset
stimulates the research on semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds in urban
scenarios. While most existing approaches predict sparse pointwise semantic
classes for the sparse input LiDAR scan, we propose PillarSegNet to be able to
output a dense semantic grid map. In contrast to a previously proposed grid map
method, PillarSegNet uses PointNet to learn features directly from the 3D point
cloud and then conducts 2D semantic segmentation in the top view. To train and
evaluate our approach, we use both sparse and dense ground truth, where the
dense ground truth is obtained from multiple superimposed scans. Experimental
results on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that PillarSegNet achieves a
performance gain of about 10% mIoU over the state-of-the-art grid map method.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes a method for representation learning of multimodal data
using contrastive losses. A traditional approach is to contrast different
modalities to learn the information shared between them. However, that approach
could fail to learn the complementary synergies between modalities that might
be useful for downstream tasks. Another approach is to concatenate all the
modalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple
correspondences. However, that approach could consider only the stronger
modalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose
a novel contrastive learning objective, TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based
not only on positive and negative correspondences but also by composing new
negative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with
these additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the
correspondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak
modalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justification based on
mutual information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample
optimization algorithm to generate positive and negative samples to maximize
training efficacy. We find that TupleInfoNCE significantly outperforms the
previous state of the arts on three different downstream tasks.</span>

quadratic complexity which restricts application of transformer models in
vision tasks. We modify the ViT architecture to work on longer sequence data by
replacing the quadratic attention with efficient transformers like Performer,
Linformer and Nystr\&quot;omformer of linear complexity creating Vision X-formers
(ViX). We show that ViX performs better than ViT in image classification
consuming lesser computing resources. We further show that replacing the
embedding linear layer by convolutional layers in ViX further increases their
performance. Our test on recent visions transformer models like LeViT and
Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) show that replacing the attention with
Nystr\&quot;omformer or Performer saves GPU usage and memory without deteriorating
performance. Incorporating these changes can democratize transformers by making
them accessible to those with limited data and computing resources.</span>

in computer vision and image processing. In this paper, we carry out a
comprehensive review on image feature information (IFI) extraction techniques
for interest point detection. To systematically introduce how the existing
interest point detection methods extract IFI from an input image, we propose a
taxonomy of the IFI extraction techniques for interest point detection.
According to this taxonomy, we discuss different types of IFI extraction
techniques for interest point detection. Furthermore, we identify the main
unresolved issues related to the existing IFI extraction techniques for
interest point detection and any interest point detection methods that have not
been discussed before. The existing popular datasets and evaluation standards
are provided and the performances for eighteen state-of-the-art approaches are
evaluated and discussed. Moreover, future research directions on IFI extraction
techniques for interest point detection are elaborated.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks are known to give better performance with increased depth due
to their ability to learn more abstract features. Although the deepening of
networks has been well established, there is still room for efficient feature
extraction within a layer which would reduce the need for mere parameter
increment. The conventional widening of networks by having more filters in each
layer introduces a quadratic increment of parameters. Having multiple parallel
convolutional/dense operations in each layer solves this problem, but without
any context-dependent allocation of resources among these operations: the
parallel computations tend to learn similar features making the widening
process less effective. Therefore, we propose the use of multi-path neural
networks with data-dependent resource allocation among parallel computations
within layers, which also lets an input to be routed end-to-end through these
parallel paths. To do this, we first introduce a cross-prediction based
algorithm between parallel tensors of subsequent layers. Second, we further
reduce the routing overhead by introducing feature-dependent cross-connections
between parallel tensors of successive layers. Our multi-path networks show
superior performance to existing widening and adaptive feature extraction, and
even ensembles, and deeper networks at similar complexity in the image
recognition task.</span>

diagnosis, and automated WSI analysis is key for computer-aided diagnosis.
Currently, analyzing the integrated descriptor of probabilities or feature maps
from massive local patches encoded by ResNet classifier is the main manner for
WSI-level prediction. Feature representations of the sparse and tiny lesion
cells in cervical slides, however, are still challengeable for the
under-promoted upstream encoders, while the unused spatial representations of
cervical cells are the available features to supply the semantics analysis. As
well as patches sampling with overlap and repetitive processing incur the
inefficiency and the unpredictable side effect. This study designs a novel
inline connection network (InCNet) by enriching the multi-scale connectivity to
build the lightweight model named You Only Look Cytopathology Once (YOLCO) with
the additional supervision of spatial information. The proposed model allows
the input size enlarged to megapixel that can stitch the WSI without any
overlap by the average repeats decreased from $10^3\sim10^4$ to $10^1\sim10^2$
for collecting features and predictions at two scales. Based on Transformer for
classifying the integrated multi-scale multi-task features, the experimental
results appear $0.872$ AUC score better and $2.51\times$ faster than the best
conventional method in WSI classification on multicohort datasets of 2,019
slides from four scanning devices.</span>

                                        <span>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) approaches have typically attempted to match
places by identifying visual cues, image regions or landmarks that have high
&#x60;&#x60;utility&#x27;&#x27; in identifying a specific place. But this concept of utility is not
singular - rather it can take a range of forms. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to deduce two key types of utility for VPR: the utility of
visual cues &#x60;specific&#x27; to an environment, and to a particular place. We employ
contrastive learning principles to estimate both the environment- and
place-specific utility of Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)
clusters in an unsupervised manner, which is then used to guide local feature
matching through keypoint selection. By combining these two utility measures,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging
benchmark datasets, while simultaneously reducing the required storage and
compute time. We provide further analysis demonstrating that unsupervised
cluster selection results in semantically meaningful results, that finer
grained categorization often has higher utility for VPR than high level
semantic categorization (e.g. building, road), and characterise how these two
utility measures vary across different places and environments. Source code is

surface. Data quality is the key to enhance remote sensing applications and
obtaining a clear and noise-free set of data is very difficult in most
situations due to the varying acquisition (e.g., atmosphere and season),
sensor, and platform (e.g., satellite angles and sensor characteristics)
conditions. With the increasing development of satellites, nowadays Terabytes
of remote sensing images can be acquired every day. Therefore, information and
data fusion can be particularly important in the remote sensing community. The
fusion integrates data from various sources acquired asynchronously for
information extraction, analysis, and quality improvement. In this chapter, we
aim to discuss the theory of spatiotemporal fusion by investigating previous
works, in addition to describing the basic concepts and some of its
applications by summarizing our prior and ongoing works.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based image reconstruction approaches have demonstrated
impressive empirical performance in many imaging modalities. These approaches
generally require a large amount of high-quality training data, which is often
not available. To circumvent this issue, we develop a novel unsupervised
knowledge-transfer paradigm for learned iterative reconstruction within a
Bayesian framework. The proposed approach learns an iterative reconstruction
network in two phases. The first phase trains a reconstruction network with a
set of ordered pairs comprising of ground truth images and measurement data.
The second phase fine-tunes the pretrained network to the measurement data
without supervision. Furthermore, the framework delivers uncertainty
information over the reconstructed image. We present extensive experimental
results on low-dose and sparse-view computed tomography, showing that the
proposed framework significantly improves reconstruction quality not only
visually, but also quantitatively in terms of PSNR and SSIM, and is competitive
with several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised reconstruction
techniques.</span>

this work, we present a new General Purpose (GenP) ensemble that boosts
performance by combining local features, dense sampling features, and deep
learning approaches. First, we introduce three new methods for data
augmentation based on PCA/DCT; second, we show that different data augmentation
approaches can boost the performance of an ensemble of CNNs; and, finally, we
propose a set of handcrafted/learned descriptors that are highly generalizable.
Each handcrafted descriptor is used to train a different Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and the different SVMs are combined with the ensemble of CNNs. Our
method is evaluated on a diverse set of bioimage classification problems.
Results demonstrate that the proposed GenP bioimage ensemble obtains
state-of-the-art performance without any ad-hoc dataset tuning of parameters
(thus avoiding the risk of overfitting/overtraining).</span>

                                        <span>Prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a challenging
task. In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to
automate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although
the performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still
room for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in
clinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image
segmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the
background pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a
DL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images
to produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and
the background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of
DL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard
center-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate
segmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net.
The proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms
of segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks.
In terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and
ResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale 3D
point clouds. By relying on expensive sampling techniques or computationally
heavy pre/post-processing steps, most existing approaches are only able to be
trained and operate over small-scale point clouds. In this paper, we introduce
RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture to directly infer
per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds. The key to our approach is to
use random point sampling instead of more complex point selection approaches.
Although remarkably computation and memory efficient, random sampling can
discard key features by chance. To overcome this, we introduce a novel local
feature aggregation module to progressively increase the receptive field for
each 3D point, thereby effectively preserving geometric details. Comparative
experiments show that our RandLA-Net can process 1 million points in a single
pass up to 200x faster than existing approaches. Moreover, extensive
experiments on five large-scale point cloud datasets, including Semantic3D,
SemanticKITTI, Toronto3D, NPM3D and S3DIS, demonstrate the state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation performance of our RandLA-Net.</span>

over open surgery. Due to the hardware improvements such as high definition

face attributes using a photo-realistic face and/or semantic mask as input. In
the absence of the photo-realistic image (only sketch/mask available), previous
methods only retrieve the original face but ignore the potential of aiding
model controllability and diversity in the translation process. This paper
proposes a sketch-to-image generation framework called S2FGAN, aiming to
improve users&#x27; ability to interpret and flexibility of face attribute editing
from a simple sketch. The proposed framework modifies the constrained latent
space semantics trained on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We employ
two latent spaces to control the face appearance and adjust the desired
attributes of the generated face. Instead of constraining the translation
process by using a reference image, the users can command the model to retouch
the generated images by involving the semantic information in the generation
process. In this way, our method can manipulate single or multiple face
attributes by only specifying attributes to be changed. Extensive experimental
results on CelebAMask-HQ dataset empirically shows our superior performance and
effectiveness on this task. Our method successfully outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on attribute manipulation by exploiting greater

improvements in their accuracy, but device memory is not growing at the same
rate. This creates fundamental challenges for training neural networks within
limited memory environments. In this work, we propose ActNN, a memory-efficient
training framework that stores randomly quantized activations for back
propagation. We prove the convergence of ActNN for general network
architectures, and we characterize the impact of quantization on the
convergence via an exact expression for the gradient variance. Using our
theory, we propose novel mixed-precision quantization strategies that exploit
the activation&#x27;s heterogeneity across feature dimensions, samples, and layers.
These techniques can be readily applied to existing dynamic graph frameworks,
such as PyTorch, simply by substituting the layers. We evaluate ActNN on
mainstream computer vision models for classification, detection, and
segmentation tasks. On all these tasks, ActNN compresses the activation to 2
bits on average, with negligible accuracy loss. ActNN reduces the memory
footprint of the activation by 12x, and it enables training with a 6.6x to 14x
larger batch size.</span>

bloodstream to image the vascular structure of the retina. The injected dye can
cause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, and even
death. In contrast, color fundus imaging is a non-invasive technique used for
photographing the retina but does not have sufficient fidelity for capturing
its vascular structure. The only non-invasive method for capturing retinal
vasculature is optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). However, OCTA
equipment is quite expensive, and stable imaging is limited to small areas on
the retina. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) capable of simultaneously synthesizing FA images from
fundus photographs while predicting retinal degeneration. The proposed system
has the benefit of addressing the problem of imaging retinal vasculature in a
non-invasive manner as well as predicting the existence of retinal
abnormalities. We use a semi-supervised approach to train our GAN using
multiple weighted losses on different modalities of data. Our experiments
validate that the proposed architecture exceeds recent state-of-the-art
generative networks for fundus-to-angiography synthesis. Moreover, our vision
transformer-based discriminators generalize quite well on out-of-distribution

                                        <span>Scene text detection and recognition have been well explored in the past few
years. Despite the progress, efficient and accurate end-to-end spotting of
arbitrarily-shaped text remains challenging. In this work, we propose an
end-to-end text spotting framework, termed PAN++, which can efficiently detect
and recognize text of arbitrary shapes in natural scenes. PAN++ is based on the
kernel representation that reformulates a text line as a text kernel (central
region) surrounded by peripheral pixels. By systematically comparing with
existing scene text representations, we show that our kernel representation can
not only describe arbitrarily-shaped text but also well distinguish adjacent
text. Moreover, as a pixel-based representation, the kernel representation can
be predicted by a single fully convolutional network, which is very friendly to
real-time applications. Taking the advantages of the kernel representation, we
design a series of components as follows: 1) a computationally efficient
feature enhancement network composed of stacked Feature Pyramid Enhancement
Modules (FPEMs); 2) a lightweight detection head cooperating with Pixel
Aggregation (PA); and 3) an efficient attention-based recognition head with
Masked RoI. Benefiting from the kernel representation and the tailored
components, our method achieves high inference speed while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method.
For example, the proposed PAN++ achieves an end-to-end text spotting F-measure
of 64.9 at 29.2 FPS on the Total-Text dataset, which significantly outperforms
the previous best method. Code will be available at: https://git.io/PAN.</span>

                                        <span>The core problem of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the trade off between
acceleration and image quality. Image reconstruction and super-resolution are
two crucial techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Current methods are
designed to perform these tasks separately, ignoring the correlations between
them. In this work, we propose an end-to-end task transformer network
(T$^2$Net) for joint MRI reconstruction and super-resolution, which allows
representations and feature transmission to be shared between multiple task to
achieve higher-quality, super-resolved and motion-artifacts-free images from
highly undersampled and degenerated MRI data. Our framework combines both
reconstruction and super-resolution, divided into two sub-branches, whose
features are expressed as queries and keys. Specifically, we encourage joint
feature learning between the two tasks, thereby transferring accurate task
information. We first use two separate CNN branches to extract task-specific
features. Then, a task transformer module is designed to embed and synthesize
the relevance between the two tasks. Experimental results show that our
multi-task model significantly outperforms advanced sequential methods, both
quantitatively and qualitatively.</span>

SUTD-TrafficQA (Traffic Question Answering), which takes the form of video QA
based on the collected 10,080 in-the-wild videos and annotated 62,535 QA pairs,

challenging reasoning tasks corresponding to various traffic scenarios, so as

                                        <span>Automated red blood cell (RBC) classification on blood smear images helps
hematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However,
overlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be
separated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple
classes with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging
because normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper
presents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,
specifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing
on overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates
ellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then
finds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood
smear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.
However, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was
34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of
machine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence
more challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal
with this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679,
respectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results
showed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential
to deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes,
while data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Photorealistic stylization aims to transfer the style of a reference photo
onto a content photo in a natural fashion, such that the stylized image looks
like a real photo taken by a camera. State-of-the-art methods stylize the image
locally within each matched semantic region and are prone to global color
inconsistency across semantic objects/parts, making the stylized image less
photorealistic. To tackle the challenging issues, we propose a non-local
representation scheme, constrained with a mutual affine-transfer network
(NL-MAT). Through a dictionary-based decomposition, NL-MAT is able to
successfully decouple matched non-local representations and color information
of the image pair, such that the context correspondence between the image pair
is incorporated naturally, which largely facilitates local style transfer in a
global-consistent fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to address the photorealistic stylization problem with a non-local
representation scheme, such that no additional models or steps for semantic
matching are required during stylization. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method is able to generate photorealistic results with local style
transfer while preserving both the spatial structure and global color
consistency of the content image.</span>

                                        <span>3D object detection is an important yet demanding task that heavily relies on
difficult to obtain 3D annotations. To reduce the required amount of
supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D
object detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. We leverage a
teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the
labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due
to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from
significant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a
confidence-based filtering mechanism, inspired by FixMatch. We set confidence
thresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability to filter
low-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures
do not sufficiently capture localization quality. We therefore propose to use
the estimated 3D IoU as a localization metric and set category-aware
self-adjusted thresholds to filter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet
as our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the
autonomous driving dataset, KITTI. Our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant
margins under all label ratios (including fully labeled setting). For example,
when training using only 10\% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7%
absolute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5% absolute improvement on mAP@0.5 upon
the prior art. On KITTI, we are the first to demonstrate semi-supervised 3D
object detection and our method surpasses a fully supervised baseline from 1.8%
to 7.6% under different label ratios and categories.</span>

                                        <span>Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize the entire word or sentence
with multiple characters in natural images. It is still challenging because
ambiguity often occurs when the spacing between characters is large or the
characters are evenly spread in multiple rows and columns, making many visually
plausible groupings of the characters (e.g. &quot;BERLIN&quot; is incorrectly detected as
&quot;BERL&quot; and &quot;IN&quot; in Fig. 1(c)). Unlike previous works that merely employed
visual features for text detection, this work proposes a novel text spotter,
named Ambiguity Eliminating Text Spotter (AE TextSpotter), which learns both
visual and linguistic features to significantly reduce ambiguity in text
detection. The proposed AE TextSpotter has three important benefits. 1) The
linguistic representation is learned together with the visual representation in
a framework. To our knowledge, it is the first time to improve text detection
by using a language model. 2) A carefully designed language module is utilized
to reduce the detection confidence of incorrect text lines, making them easily
pruned in the detection stage. 3) Extensive experiments show that AE
TextSpotter outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. For
example, we carefully select a validation set of extremely ambiguous samples
from the IC19-ReCTS dataset, where our approach surpasses other methods by more
than 4%. The code has been released at
https://github.com/whai362/AE_TextSpotter. The image list and evaluation
scripts of the validation set have been released at

                                        <span>Deep convolutional neural networks, assisted by architectural design
strategies, make extensive use of data augmentation techniques and layers with
a high number of feature maps to embed object transformations. That is highly
inefficient and for large datasets implies a massive redundancy of features
detectors. Even though capsules networks are still in their infancy, they
constitute a promising solution to extend current convolutional networks and
endow artificial visual perception with a process to encode more efficiently
all feature affine transformations. Indeed, a properly working capsule network
should theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of
parameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints.
Nevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this
paper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their
capacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160K
parameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve
state-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the
original CapsNet parameters. Moreover, we replace dynamic routing with a novel
non-iterative, highly parallelizable routing algorithm that can easily cope
with a reduced number of capsules. Extensive experimentation with other capsule
implementations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and the
capability of capsule networks to efficiently embed visual representations more
prone to generalization.</span>

                                        <span>In neuroimaging, MRI tissue properties characterize underlying neurobiology,
provide quantitative biomarkers for neurological disease detection and
analysis, and can be used to synthesize arbitrary MRI contrasts. Estimating
tissue properties from a single scan session using a protocol available on all
clinical scanners promises to reduce scan time and cost, enable quantitative
analysis in routine clinical scans and provide scan-independent biomarkers of
disease. However, existing tissue properties estimation methods - most often
$\mathbf{T_1}$ relaxation, $\mathbf{T_2^*}$ relaxation, and proton density
($\mathbf{PD}$) - require data from multiple scan sessions and cannot estimate
all properties from a single clinically available MRI protocol such as the
multiecho MRI scan. In addition, the widespread use of non-standard acquisition
parameters across clinical imaging sites require estimation methods that can
generalize across varying scanner parameters. However, existing learning
methods are acquisition protocol specific and cannot estimate from heterogenous
clinical data from different imaging sites. In this work we propose an
unsupervised deep-learning strategy that employs MRI physics to estimate all
three tissue properties from a single multiecho MRI scan session, and
generalizes across varying acquisition parameters. The proposed strategy
optimizes accurate synthesis of new MRI contrasts from estimated latent tissue
properties, enabling unsupervised training, we also employ random acquisition
parameters during training to achieve acquisition generalization. We provide
the first demonstration of estimating all tissue properties from a single
multiecho scan session. We demonstrate improved accuracy and generalizability
for tissue property estimation and MRI synthesis.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks have achieved success in a wide array of perceptual tasks but
often fail at tasks involving both perception and higher-level reasoning. On
these more challenging tasks, bespoke approaches (such as modular symbolic
components, independent dynamics models or semantic parsers) targeted towards
that specific type of task have typically performed better. The downside to
these targeted approaches, however, is that they can be more brittle than
general-purpose neural networks, requiring significant modification or even
redesign according to the particular task at hand. Here, we propose a more
general neural-network-based approach to dynamic visual reasoning problems that
obtains state-of-the-art performance on three different domains, in each case
outperforming bespoke modular approaches tailored specifically to the task. Our
method relies on learned object-centric representations, self-attention and
self-supervised dynamics learning, and all three elements together are required
for strong performance to emerge. The success of this combination suggests that
there may be no need to trade off flexibility for performance on problems
involving spatio-temporal or causal-style reasoning. With the right soft biases
and learning objectives in a neural network we may be able to attain the best
of both worlds.</span>

                                        <span>Visual Semantic Embedding (VSE) is a dominant approach for vision-language
retrieval, which aims at learning a deep embedding space such that visual data
are embedded close to their semantic text labels or descriptions. Recent VSE
models use complex methods to better contextualize and aggregate multi-modal
features into holistic embeddings. However, we discover that surprisingly
simple (but carefully selected) global pooling functions (e.g., max pooling)
outperform those complex models, across different feature extractors. Despite
its simplicity and effectiveness, seeking the best pooling function for
different data modality and feature extractor is costly and tedious, especially
when the size of features varies (e.g., text, video). Therefore, we propose a
Generalized Pooling Operator (GPO), which learns to automatically adapt itself
to the best pooling strategy for different features, requiring no manual tuning
while staying effective and efficient. We extend the VSE model using this
proposed GPO and denote it as VSE$\infty$.

Without bells and whistles, VSE$\infty$ outperforms previous VSE methods
significantly on image-text retrieval benchmarks across popular feature
extractors. With a simple adaptation, variants of VSE$\infty$ further
demonstrate its strength by achieving the new state of the art on two
video-text retrieval datasets. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations
confirm that GPO always discovers the best pooling strategy and can be a
plug-and-play feature aggregation module for standard VSE models. Code and
pre-trained models are available at https://vse-infty.github.io.</span>

                                        <span>Synthesizing realistic videos of humans using neural networks has been a
popular alternative to the conventional graphics-based rendering pipeline due
to its high efficiency. Existing works typically formulate this as an
image-to-image translation problem in 2D screen space, which leads to artifacts
such as over-smoothing, missing body parts, and temporal instability of
fine-scale detail, such as pose-dependent wrinkles in the clothing. In this
paper, we propose a novel human video synthesis method that approaches these
limiting factors by explicitly disentangling the learning of time-coherent
fine-scale details from the embedding of the human in 2D screen space. More
specifically, our method relies on the combination of two convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Given the pose information, the first CNN predicts a dynamic
texture map that contains time-coherent high-frequency details, and the second
CNN conditions the generation of the final video on the temporally coherent
output of the first CNN. We demonstrate several applications of our approach,
such as human reenactment and novel view synthesis from monocular video, where
we show significant improvement over the state of the art both qualitatively
and quantitatively.</span>

multi-frequency class averaging (MFCA) -- for classifying noisy projection
images obtained from three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) by
the similarity among their viewing directions. This new algorithm leverages
multiple irreducible representations of the unitary group to introduce
additional redundancy into the representation of the optimal in-plane
rotational alignment, extending and outperforming the existing class averaging
algorithm that uses only a single representation. The formal algebraic model
and representation theoretic patterns of the proposed MFCA algorithm extend the
framework of Hadani and Singer to arbitrary irreducible representations of the
unitary group. We conceptually establish the consistency and stability of MFCA
by inspecting the spectral properties of a generalized local parallel transport
operator through the lens of Wigner $D$-matrices. We demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed algorithm with numerical experiments.</span>

                                        <span>Since visual perception can give rich information beyond text descriptions
for world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging
visual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted
attention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels
for language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from
approximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary
diversity of a small image-text dataset. To overcome these limitations, we
present VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation method for improving
language understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher model on a video-text
dataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student language model with a
text dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to use different
knowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a large-scale
video-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In our
experiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only language
models and vokenization models, on several downstream language understanding
tasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the improved world
knowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning capabilities of our model
by evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Lastly, we
present comprehensive ablation studies as well as visualizations of the learned
text-to-video grounding results of our teacher and student language models. Our

                                        <span>Collaborative machine learning techniques such as federated learning (FL)
enable the training of models on effectively larger datasets without data
transfer. Recent initiatives have demonstrated that segmentation models trained
with FL can achieve performance similar to locally trained models. However, FL
is not a fully privacy-preserving technique and privacy-centred attacks can
disclose confidential patient data. Thus, supplementing FL with
privacy-enhancing technologies (PTs) such as differential privacy (DP) is a
requirement for clinical applications in a multi-institutional setting. The
application of PTs to FL in medical imaging and the trade-offs between privacy
guarantees and model utility, the ramifications on training performance and the
susceptibility of the final models to attacks have not yet been conclusively
investigated. Here we demonstrate the first application of differentially
private gradient descent-based FL on the task of semantic segmentation in
computed tomography. We find that high segmentation performance is possible
under strong privacy guarantees with an acceptable training time penalty. We
furthermore demonstrate the first successful gradient-based model inversion
attack on a semantic segmentation model and show that the application of DP
prevents it from divulging sensitive image features.</span>

                                        <span>Supervised learning of every possible pathology is unrealistic for many
primary care applications like health screening. Image anomaly detection
methods that learn normal appearance from only healthy data have shown
promising results recently. We propose an alternative to image
reconstruction-based and image embedding-based methods and propose a new
self-supervised method to tackle pathological anomaly detection. Our approach
originates in the foreign patch interpolation (FPI) strategy that has shown
superior performance on brain MRI and abdominal CT data. We propose to use a
better patch interpolation strategy, Poisson image interpolation (PII), which
makes our method suitable for applications in challenging data regimes. PII
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a good margin when tested on surrogate
tasks like identifying common lung anomalies in chest X-rays or hypo-plastic
left heart syndrome in prenatal, fetal cardiac ultrasound images. Code

to provide modern, secured and sustainable infrastructure and give a decent
quality of life to its residents. To fulfill this need video surveillance
cameras have been deployed to enhance the safety and well-being of the
citizens. Despite technical developments in modern science, abnormal event
detection in surveillance video systems is challenging and requires exhaustive
human efforts. In this paper, we surveyed various methodologies developed to
detect anomalies in intelligent video surveillance. Firstly, we revisit the
surveys on anomaly detection in the last decade. We then present a systematic
categorization of methodologies developed for ease of understanding.
Considering the notion of anomaly depends on context, we identify different
objects-of-interest and publicly available datasets in anomaly detection. Since
anomaly detection is considered a time-critical application of computer vision,
our emphasis is on anomaly detection using edge devices and approaches
explicitly designed for them. Further, we discuss the challenges and
opportunities involved in anomaly detection at the edge.</span>

parts of an object if you could locally push it? There will be distinctive
movement, despite evident variations caused by the stochastic nature of our
world. These outcomes are governed by the characteristic kinematics of objects
that dictate their overall motion caused by a local interaction. Conversely,
the movement of an object provides crucial information about its underlying
distinctive kinematics and the interdependencies between its parts. This
two-way relation motivates learning a bijective mapping between object
kinematics and plausible future image sequences. Therefore, we propose iPOKE -
invertible Prediction of Object Kinematics - that, conditioned on an initial
frame and a local poke, allows to sample object kinematics and establishes a
one-to-one correspondence to the corresponding plausible videos, thereby
providing a controlled stochastic video synthesis. In contrast to previous
works, we do not generate arbitrary realistic videos, but provide efficient
control of movements, while still capturing the stochastic nature of our
environment and the diversity of plausible outcomes it entails. Moreover, our
approach can transfer kinematics onto novel object instances and is not
confined to particular object classes. Project page is available at

                                        <span>Hand segmentation is a crucial task in first-person vision. Since
first-person images exhibit strong bias in appearance among different
environments, adapting a pre-trained segmentation model to a new domain is
required in hand segmentation. Here, we focus on appearance gaps for hand
regions and backgrounds separately. We propose (i) foreground-aware image
stylization and (ii) consensus pseudo-labeling for domain adaptation of hand
segmentation. We stylize source images independently for the foreground and
background using target images as style. To resolve the domain shift that the
stylization has not addressed, we apply careful pseudo-labeling by taking a
consensus between the models trained on the source and stylized source images.
We validated our method on domain adaptation of hand segmentation from real and
simulation images. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in both
settings. We also demonstrated promising results in challenging multi-target
domain adaptation and domain generalization settings. Code is available at

intention of conveying a specific meaning, can be considered as a hand gesture.
Inputs to hand gesture recognition systems can be in several forms, such as
depth images, monocular RGB, or skeleton joint points. We observe that raw
depth images possess low contrasts in the hand regions of interest (ROI). They
do not highlight important details to learn, such as finger bending information
(whether a finger is overlapping the palm, or another finger). Recently, in
deep-learning--based dynamic hand gesture recognition, researchers are tying to
fuse different input modalities (e.g. RGB or depth images and hand skeleton
joint points) to improve the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we focus on
dynamic hand gesture (DHG) recognition using depth quantized image features and
hand skeleton joint points. In particular, we explore the effect of using
depth-quantized features in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) based multi-modal fusion networks. We find that our method
improves existing results on the SHREC-DHG-14 dataset. Furthermore, using our
method, we show that it is possible to reduce the resolution of the input
images by more than four times and still obtain comparable or better accuracy
to that of the resolutions used in previous methods.</span>

incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. We
propose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning
neural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth
supervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to
regularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering
novel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require
images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running
structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that
can be used as &#x60;&#x60;free&quot; depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss
to ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is
close to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate
images given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two
training views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as
well as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with
these NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible
supervisory signal. Finally, we show that DS-NeRF supports other types of depth
supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGBD reconstruction outputs.</span>

                                        <span>Robust and accurate localization is an essential component for robotic
navigation and autonomous driving. The use of cameras for localization with
high definition map (HD Map) provides an affordable localization sensor set.
Existing methods suffer from pose estimation failure due to error prone data
association or initialization with accurate initial pose requirement. In this
paper, we propose a cost-effective vehicle localization system with HD map for
autonomous driving that uses cameras as primary sensors. To this end, we
formulate vision-based localization as a data association problem that maps
visual semantics to landmarks in HD map. Specifically, system initialization is
finished in a coarse to fine manner by combining coarse GPS (Global Positioning
System) measurement and fine pose searching. In tracking stage, vehicle pose is
refined by implicitly aligning the semantic segmentation result between image
and landmarks in HD maps with photometric consistency. Finally, vehicle pose is
computed by pose graph optimization in a sliding window fashion. We evaluate
our method on two datasets and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields
promising localization results in different driving scenarios. Additionally,
our approach is suitable for both monocular camera and multi-cameras that
provides flexibility and improves robustness for the localization system.</span>

                                        <span>Robust vision restoration for an underwater image remains a challenging
problem. For the lack of aligned underwater-terrestrial image pairs, the
unsupervised method is more suited to this task. However, the pure data-driven
unsupervised method usually has difficulty in achieving realistic color
correction for lack of optical constraint. In this paper, we propose a data-
and physics-driven unsupervised architecture that learns underwater vision
restoration from unpaired underwater-terrestrial images. For sufficient domain
transformation and detail preservation, the underwater degeneration needs to be
explicitly constructed based on the optically unambiguous physics law. Thus, we
employ the Jaffe-McGlamery degradation theory to design the generation models,
and use neural networks to describe the process of underwater degradation.
Furthermore, to overcome the problem of invalid gradient when optimizing the
hybrid physical-neural model, we fully investigate the intrinsic correlation
between the scene depth and the degradation factors for the backscattering
estimation, to improve the restoration performance through physical
constraints. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is able to
perform high-quality restoration for unconstrained underwater images without
any supervision. On multiple benchmarks, we outperform several state-of-the-art
supervised and unsupervised approaches. We also demonstrate that our methods
yield encouraging results on real-world applications.</span>

available data, segmentation of pediatric images is challenging for deep
learning methods. In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose
and scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our
architecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated
together during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity
matrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable
module to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module,
based on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the
original UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and
scale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module
learns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size.
Furthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows
saving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test
the proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal
pediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization
of size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard
data-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney
(88.01\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\%
to 87.12\%).</span>

                                        <span>Hyperspectral pansharpening aims to synthesize a low-resolution hyperspectral
image (LR-HSI) with a registered panchromatic image (PAN) to generate an
enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution. Recently proposed HS
pansharpening methods have obtained remarkable results using deep convolutional
networks (ConvNets), which typically consist of three steps: (1) up-sampling
the LR-HSI, (2) predicting the residual image via a ConvNet, and (3) obtaining
the final fused HSI by adding the outputs from first and second steps. Recent
methods have leveraged Deep Image Prior (DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to
its excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral information,
without learning from large data sets. However, we observed that the quality of
up-sampled HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional
spatial-domain constraint to the conventional spectral-domain energy function.
We define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance between the
predicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the
up-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).
Moreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the
reference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures. In
order to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete
network, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by
constraining the receptive from increasing in the deep layers. We perform
experiments on three HSI datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our
DIP-HyperKite over the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. The deployment
codes, pre-trained models, and final fusion outputs of our DIP-HyperKite and
the methods used for the comparisons will be publicly made available at

                                        <span>Homography estimation is an important task in computer vision, such as image
stitching, video stabilization, and camera calibration. Traditional homography
estimation methods heavily depend on the quantity and distribution of feature
points, leading to poor robustness in textureless scenes. The learning
solutions, on the contrary, try to learn robust deep features but demonstrate
unsatisfying performance in the scenes of low overlap rates. In this paper, we
address the two problems simultaneously, by designing a contextual correlation
layer, which can capture the long-range correlation on feature maps and
flexibly be bridged in a learning framework. In addition, considering that a
single homography can not represent the complex spatial transformation in
depth-varying images with parallax, we propose to predict multi-grid homography
from global to local. Moreover, we equip our network with depth perception
capability, by introducing a novel depth-aware shape-preserved loss. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other
state-of-the-art solutions in the synthetic benchmark dataset and real-world
dataset. The codes and models will be available at

                                        <span>For early breast cancer detection, regular screening with mammography imaging
is recommended. Routinary examinations result in datasets with a predominant
amount of negative samples. A potential solution to such class-imbalance is
joining forces across multiple institutions. Developing a collaborative
computer-aided diagnosis system is challenging in different ways. Patient
privacy and regulations need to be carefully respected. Data across
institutions may be acquired from different devices or imaging protocols,
leading to heterogeneous non-IID data. Also, for learning-based methods, new
optimization strategies working on distributed data are required. Recently,
federated learning has emerged as an effective tool for collaborative learning.
In this setting, local models perform computation on their private data to
update the global model. The order and the frequency of local updates influence
the final global model. Hence, the order in which samples are locally presented
to the optimizers plays an important role. In this work, we define a
memory-aware curriculum learning method for the federated setting. Our
curriculum controls the order of the training samples paying special attention
to those that are forgotten after the deployment of the global model. Our
approach is combined with unsupervised domain adaptation to deal with domain
shift while preserving data privacy. We evaluate our method with three clinical
datasets from different vendors. Our results verify the effectiveness of
federated adversarial learning for the multi-site breast cancer classification.
Moreover, we show that our proposed memory-aware curriculum method is
beneficial to further improve classification performance. Our code is publicly

                                        <span>Instance segmentation is an important computer vision problem which remains
challenging despite impressive recent advances due to deep learning-based
methods. Given sufficient training data, fully supervised methods can yield
excellent performance, but annotation of ground-truth data remains a major
bottleneck, especially for biomedical applications where it has to be performed
by domain experts. The amount of labels required can be drastically reduced by
using rules derived from prior knowledge to guide the segmentation. However,
these rules are in general not differentiable and thus cannot be used with
existing methods. Here, we relax this requirement by using stateless actor
critic reinforcement learning, which enables non-differentiable rewards. We
formulate the instance segmentation problem as graph partitioning and the actor
critic predicts the edge weights driven by the rewards, which are based on the
conformity of segmented instances to high-level priors on object shape,
position or size. The experiments on toy and real datasets demonstrate that we
can achieve excellent performance without any direct supervision based only on
a rich set of priors.</span>

preserving high-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate
positions as an array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the
effectiveness of these positional encodings has been solely studied through a
Fourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing
that alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for
positional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely
determined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and
the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish
that the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case
that fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory
to analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. To this
end, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that
our theoretical claims hold in practice. Codes available at

outputs generally deviates from the distribution of the signals it attempts to
estimate. This phenomenon, known as the perception-distortion tradeoff, has
captured significant attention in image restoration, where it implies that
fidelity to ground truth images comes at the expense of perceptual quality
(deviation from statistics of natural images). However, despite the increasing
popularity of performing comparisons on the perception-distortion plane, there
remains an important open question: what is the minimal distortion that can be
achieved under a given perception constraint? In this paper, we derive a closed
form expression for this distortion-perception (DP) function for the mean
squared-error (MSE) distortion and the Wasserstein-2 perception index. We prove
that the DP function is always quadratic, regardless of the underlying
distribution. This stems from the fact that estimators on the DP curve form a
geodesic in Wasserstein space. In the Gaussian setting, we further provide a
closed form expression for such estimators. For general distributions, we show
how these estimators can be constructed from the estimators at the two extremes
of the tradeoff: The global MSE minimizer, and a minimizer of the MSE under a
perfect perceptual quality constraint. The latter can be obtained as a
stochastic transformation of the former.</span>

                                        <span>3D point cloud registration is a fundamental task in robotics and computer
vision. Recently, many learning-based point cloud registration methods based on
correspondences have emerged. However, these methods heavily rely on such
correspondences and meet great challenges with partial overlap. In this paper,
we propose ROPNet, a new deep learning model using Representative Overlapping
Points with discriminative features for registration that transforms
partial-to-partial registration into partial-to-complete registration.
Specifically, we propose a context-guided module which uses an encoder to
extract global features for predicting point overlap score. To better find
representative overlapping points, we use the extracted global features for
coarse alignment. Then, we introduce a Transformer to enrich point features and
remove non-representative points based on point overlap score and feature
matching. A similarity matrix is built in a partial-to-complete mode, and
finally, weighted SVD is adopted to estimate a transformation matrix. Extensive
experiments over ModelNet40 using noisy and partially overlapping point clouds
show that the proposed method outperforms traditional and learning-based
methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at

                                        <span>As cameras are increasingly deployed in new application domains such as
autonomous driving, performing 3D object detection on monocular images becomes
an important task for visual scene understanding. Recent advances on monocular
3D object detection mainly rely on the &#x60;&#x60;pseudo-LiDAR&#x27;&#x27; generation, which
performs monocular depth estimation and lifts the 2D pixels to pseudo 3D
points. However, depth estimation from monocular images, due to its poor
accuracy, leads to inevitable position shift of pseudo-LiDAR points within the
object. Therefore, the predicted bounding boxes may suffer from inaccurate
location and deformed shape. In this paper, we present a novel neighbor-voting
method that incorporates neighbor predictions to ameliorate object detection
from severely deformed pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, each feature
point around the object forms their own predictions, and then the &#x60;&#x60;consensus&#x27;&#x27;
is achieved through voting. In this way, we can effectively combine the
neighbors&#x27; predictions with local prediction and achieve more accurate 3D
detection. To further enlarge the difference between the foreground region of
interest (ROI) pseudo-LiDAR points and the background points, we also encode
the ROI prediction scores of 2D foreground pixels into the corresponding
pseudo-LiDAR points. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark to
validate the merits of our proposed method. Our results on the bird&#x27;s eye view
detection outperform the state-of-the-art performance by a large margin,
especially for the &#x60;&#x60;hard&#x27;&#x27; level detection.</span>

divide adjacent building floors can benefit many applications, for example,
urban augmented reality (AR). This work tackles the problem of locating
floor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning
approach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a
network $-$ current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations
that lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective
priors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new
data augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the
rich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of
buildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task
learning network that associates explicit features of building facades and
implicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help
enforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations
are then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit
self-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction
of floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on
assorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Also, we present context-aware image overlay
results and show the potentials of our approach in enriching AR-related
applications.</span>

accuracy and F1 score has become the de facto standard to measure the
performance of lane detection methods. In this work, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art lane
detection methods under physical-world adversarial attacks in autonomous
driving. We evaluate 4 major types of lane detection approaches with the
conventional evaluation and end-to-end evaluation in autonomous driving
scenarios and then discuss the security proprieties of each lane detection
model. We demonstrate that the conventional evaluation fails to reflect the
robustness in end-to-end autonomous driving scenarios. Our results show that
the most robust model on the conventional metrics is the least robust in the
end-to-end evaluation. Although the competition dataset and its metrics have
played a substantial role in developing performant lane detection methods along
with the rapid development of deep neural networks, the conventional evaluation
is becoming obsolete and the gap between the metrics and practicality is
critical. We hope that our study will help the community make further progress

                                        <span>Though convolutional neural networks are widely used in different tasks, lack
of generalization capability in the absence of sufficient and representative
data is one of the challenges that hinder their practical application. In this
paper, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play training strategy
named Knowledge Distillation for Domain Generalization (KDDG) which is built
upon a knowledge distillation framework with the gradient filter as a novel
regularization term. We find that both the &#x60;&#x60;richer dark knowledge&quot; from the
teacher network, as well as the gradient filter we proposed, can reduce the
difficulty of learning the mapping which further improves the generalization
ability of the model. We also conduct experiments extensively to show that our
framework can significantly improve the generalization capability of deep
neural networks in different tasks including image classification,
segmentation, reinforcement learning by comparing our method with existing
state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques. Last but not the least, we
propose to adopt two metrics to analyze our proposed method in order to better
understand how our proposed method benefits the generalization capability of
deep neural networks.</span>

Networks (GCNs),significant breakthroughs have been made in faceclustering.
However, rare attention has been paidto GCN-based clustering on imbalanced
data. Al-though imbalance problem has been extensivelystudied, the impact of
imbalanced data on GCN-based linkage prediction task is quite different,which
would cause problems in two aspects: im-balanced linkage labels and biased
graph represen-tations. The problem of imbalanced linkage labelsis similar to
that in image classification task, but thelatter is a particular problem in
GCN-based clus-tering via linkage prediction. Significantly biasedgraph
representations in training can cause catas-trophic overfitting of a GCN model.
To tacklethese problems, we evaluate the feasibility of thoseexisting methods
for imbalanced image classifica-tion problem on graphs with extensive
experiments,and present a new method to alleviate the imbal-anced labels and
also augment graph representa-tions using a Reverse-Imbalance Weighted
Sam-pling (RIWS) strategy, followed with insightfulanalyses and discussions. A

                                        <span>The main challenges of image-to-image (I2I) translation are to make the
translated image realistic and retain as much information from the source
domain as possible. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture,
termed as IEGAN, which removes the encoder of each network and introduces an
encoder that is independent of other networks. Compared with previous models,
it embodies three advantages of our model: Firstly, it is more directly and
comprehensively to grasp image information since the encoder no longer receives
loss from generator and discriminator. Secondly, the independent encoder allows
each network to focus more on its own goal which makes the translated image
more realistic. Thirdly, the reduction in the number of encoders performs more
unified image representation. However, when the independent encoder applies two
down-sampling blocks, it&#x27;s hard to extract semantic information. To tackle this
problem, we propose deep and shallow information space containing
characteristic and semantic information, which can guide the model to translate
high-quality images under the task with significant shape or texture change. We
compare IEGAN with other previous models, and conduct researches on semantic
information consistency and component ablation at the same time. These
experiments show the superiority and effectiveness of our architecture. Our
code is published on: https://github.com/Elvinky/IEGAN.</span>

despite minimal attention from the research community. However VolNet, an
architecture leveraging 2D and 3D pose estimation, body part segmentation and
volume regression extracted from a single 2D RGB image combined with the
subject&#x27;s body height can be used to estimate the total body volume. VolNet is
designed to predict the 2D and 3D pose as well as the body part segmentation in
intermediate tasks. We generated a synthetic, large-scale dataset of
photo-realistic images of human bodies with a wide range of body shapes and
realistic poses called SURREALvols. By using Volnet and combining multiple
stacked hourglass networks together with ResNeXt, our model correctly predicted
the volume in ~82% of cases with a 10% tolerance threshold. This is a
considerable improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions such as BodyNet

                                        <span>Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest
in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on
faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been
traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters
that detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,
potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of
inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately
pruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an
increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between
different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression
of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its
direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow
for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective
sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark
architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their
absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more
appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we
develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with
effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random
pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or
better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et
al., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure
distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise
sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random
pruning.</span>

tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary
environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines
how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data
in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as
deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current
multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can
detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to
their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in
this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks&#x27; learning dynamics,
emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose
Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the
concept of Continual Learning (CoL), Representation Learning (ReL), and
Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain
adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets,
while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student
model setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
is efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and

without leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence
the detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and
challenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is
usually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation
difficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy
and a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism
to localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is
based on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages
inter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high
pass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery
attention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic
inconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two
types of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal
interdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among
channels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise
inconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to
address the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial
training strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust
performance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial
attacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our
model on them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in
different benchmark datasets.</span>

polyp segmentation which consider a uncertain area of the saliency map. We
construct a modified version of U-Net shape network with additional encoder and
decoder and compute a saliency map in each bottom-up stream prediction module
and propagate to the next prediction module. In each prediction module,
previously predicted saliency map is utilized to compute foreground, background
and uncertain area map and we aggregate the feature map with three area maps
for each representation. Then we compute the relation between each
representation and each pixel in the feature map. We conduct experiments on
five popular polyp segmentation benchmarks, Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS,
CVC-ColonDB and CVC-300, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Especially,
we achieve 76.6% mean Dice on ETIS dataset which is 13.8% improvement compared
to the previous state-of-the-art method.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based image super-resolution (DL-SR) has shown great promise in
medical imaging applications. To date, most of the proposed methods for DL-SR
have only been assessed by use of traditional measures of image quality (IQ)
that are commonly employed in the field of computer vision. However, the impact
of these methods on objective measures of image quality that are relevant to
medical imaging tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate
the impact of DL-SR methods on binary signal detection performance. Two popular
DL-SR methods, the super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and
the super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), were trained by
use of simulated medical image data. Binary signal-known-exactly with
background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) and signal-known-statistically with
background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) detection tasks were formulated.
Numerical observers, which included a neural network-approximated ideal
observer and common linear numerical observers, were employed to assess the
impact of DL-SR on task performance. The impact of the complexity of the DL-SR
network architectures on task-performance was quantified. In addition, the
utility of DL-SR for improving the task-performance of sub-optimal observers
was investigated. Our numerical experiments confirmed that, as expected, DL-SR
could improve traditional measures of IQ. However, for many of the study
designs considered, the DL-SR methods provided little or no improvement in task
performance and could even degrade it. It was observed that DL-SR could improve
the task-performance of sub-optimal observers under certain conditions. The
presented study highlights the urgent need for the objective assessment of
DL-SR methods and suggests avenues for improving their efficacy in medical
imaging applications.</span>

                                        <span>Any clustering algorithm must synchronously learn to model the clusters and
allocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based
methods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate
data to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively
refine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability
of such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters
is not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize
mixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer
neurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster
distribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those
distributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of
clusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the
network end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as
the E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the
mixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with
existing representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when
mixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the
sole consistency optimization performance in clustering. Our trained networks
outperform single-stage deep clustering methods that still depend on k-means,
with unsupervised classification accuracy of 63.8% in STL10, 58% in CIFAR10,
25.9% in CIFAR100, and 98.9% in MNIST.</span>

                                        <span>In order to tackle the difficulty associated with the ill-posed nature of the
image registration problem, researchers use regularization to constrain the
solution space. For most learning-based registration approaches, the
regularization usually has a fixed weight and only constrains the spatial
transformation. Such convention has two limitations: (1) The regularization
strength of a specific image pair should be associated with the content of the
images, thus the &#x60;&#x60;one value fits all&#x27;&#x27; scheme is not ideal; (2) Only spatially
regularizing the transformation (but overlooking the temporal consistency of
different estimations) may not be the best strategy to cope with the
ill-posedness. In this study, we propose a mean-teacher based registration
framework. This framework incorporates an additional \textit{temporal
regularization} term by encouraging the teacher model&#x27;s temporal ensemble
prediction to be consistent with that of the student model. At each training
step, it also automatically adjusts the weights of the \textit{spatial
regularization} and the \textit{temporal regularization} by taking account of
the transformation uncertainty and appearance uncertainty derived from the
perturbed teacher model. We perform experiments on multi- and uni-modal
registration tasks, and the results show that our strategy outperforms the
traditional and learning-based benchmark methods.</span>

registers the template non-rigidly to each frame. We formulate the per-frame
registration as an optimization problem that includes a novel texture term
specifically tailored towards tracking objects with uniform texture but
fine-scale structure, such as the regular micro-structural patterns of fabric.
Our texture term exploits the orientation information in the micro-structures
of the objects, e.g., the yarn patterns of fabrics. This enables us to
accurately track uniformly colored materials that have these high frequency
micro-structures, for which traditional photometric terms are usually less
effective. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both

imaging recently received a lot of attention. The quality of DCNN generated HDR
images have overperformed the traditional counterparts. However, DCNN is prone
to be computationally intensive and power-hungry. To address the challenge, we
propose LightFuse, a light-weight CNN-based algorithm for extreme dual-exposure
image fusion, which can be implemented on various embedded computing platforms
with limited power and hardware resources. Two sub-networks are utilized: a
GlobalNet (G) and a DetailNet (D). The goal of G is to learn the global
illumination information on the spatial dimension, whereas D aims to enhance
local details on the channel dimension. Both G and D are based solely on
depthwise convolution (D Conv) and pointwise convolution (P Conv) to reduce
required parameters and computations. Experimental results display that the
proposed technique could generate HDR images with plausible details in
extremely exposed regions. Our PSNR score exceeds the other state-of-the-art
approaches by 1.2 to 1.6 times and achieves 1.4 to 20 times FLOP and parameter

(DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale
datasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs,
impeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be
alleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean
samples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble
Noise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select
clean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second
problem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an
uncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels
for each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight
given to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and
extensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are
provided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification
tasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise
ratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used,

to considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement
over state-of-the-art methods. Especially on more difficult datasets with
higher noise ratios, we can achieve a significant improvement over the
second-best model. Moreover, our proposed approach can easily be integrated
into existing DNN methods to improve their robustness against label noise.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.
However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3$\times$ as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\times$224
ImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images. The
models and source code will be released soon.</span>

using polarized skylight. This neural network has specific dilated convolution,
which can extract light intensity information of different polarization
directions. Then, the degree of polarization (DOP) and angle of polarization
(AOP) are directly extracted in the network. In addition, the exponential
function encoding of orientation is designed as the network output, which can

for class imbalanced classification. Cross entropy (CE) loss, which is widely
used for image recognition, is learned so that the probability value of true
class is closer to one by back propagation. However, for imbalanced datasets,
the learning is insufficient for the classes with a small number of samples.
Therefore, we propose a novel classification method using the MSE loss that can
be learned the relationships of all classes no matter which image is input.
Unlike CE loss, MSE loss is possible to equalize the number of back propagation
for all classes and to learn the feature space considering the relationships
between classes as metric learning. Furthermore, instead of the usual one-hot
teacher label, we use a novel teacher label that takes the number of class
samples into account. This induces the outlying label which depends on the
number of samples in each class, and the class with a small number of samples
has outlying margin in a feature space. It is possible to create the feature
space for separating high-difficulty classes and low-difficulty classes. By the
experiments on imbalanced classification and semantic segmentation, we
confirmed that the proposed method was much improved in comparison with
standard CE loss and conventional methods, even though only the loss and
teacher labels were changed.</span>

                                        <span>Active learning promises to alleviate the massive data needs of supervised
machine learning: it has successfully improved sample efficiency by an order of
magnitude on traditional tasks like topic classification and object
recognition. However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5
models and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety
of active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To
understand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a
per-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of
examples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to
learn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external
knowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative
visualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon
responsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that
active learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of
collective outliers in the active learning pool decreases. We conclude with a
discussion and prescriptive recommendations for mitigating the effects of these
outliers in future work.</span>

                                        <span>The universe is composed of galaxies that have diverse shapes. Once the
structure of a galaxy is determined, it is possible to obtain important
information about its formation and evolution. Morphologically classifying
galaxies means cataloging them according to their visual appearance and the
classification is linked to the physical properties of the galaxy. A
morphological classification made through visual inspection is subject to
biases introduced by subjective observations made by human volunteers. For this
reason, systematic, objective and easily reproducible classification of
galaxies has been gaining importance since the astronomer Edwin Hubble created
his famous classification method. In this work, we combine accurate visual
classifications of the Galaxy Zoo project with \emph {Deep Learning} methods.
The goal is to find an efficient technique at human performance level
classification, but in a systematic and automatic way, for classification of
elliptical and spiral galaxies. For this, a neural network model was created
through an Ensemble of four other convolutional models, allowing a greater
accuracy in the classification than what would be obtained with any one
individual. Details of the individual models and improvements made are also
described. The present work is entirely based on the analysis of images (not
parameter tables) from DR1 (www.datalab.noao.edu) of the Southern Photometric
Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). In terms of classification, we achieved, with
the Ensemble, an accuracy of $\approx 99 \%$ in the test sample (using
pre-trained networks).</span>

appearance embedding mostly rely on instance-level matching without considering
the temporal continuity provided by videos. We design a new instance-to-track

detection to the embedding of the tracks persisted in the tracker. It enables
us to learn not only from videos labeled with complete tracks, but also
unlabeled or partially labeled videos. We implement this learning objective in

clinical diagnoses, model generalizability is of the utmost importance as
clinical decision-making must be domain-agnostic. A method of tackling the
problem is to increase the dataset to include images from a multitude of
domains; while this technique is ideal, the security requirements of medical
data is a major limitation. Additionally, researchers with developed tools
benefit from the addition of open-sourced data, but are limited by the
difference in domains. Herewith, we investigated the implementation of a
Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for the domain
adaptation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes. This study was done
in collaboration with the Biomedical Optics Research Group and Functional &amp;
Anatomical Imaging &amp; Shape Analysis Lab at Simon Fraser University. In this
study, we investigated a learning-based approach of adapting the domain of a
publicly available dataset, UK Biobank dataset (UKB). To evaluate the
performance of domain adaptation, we utilized pre-existing retinal layer
segmentation tools developed on a different set of RETOUCH OCT data. This study
provides insight on state-of-the-art tools for domain adaptation compared to
traditional processing techniques as well as a pipeline for adapting publicly

Macular Degeneration (AMD) lesions in RGB eye fundus images. For this, we align
invasively obtained eye fundus contrast images (the &quot;golden standard&quot;
diagnostic) to the RGB ones and use them to hand-annotate the lesions. This is
done using our custom-made tool. Using the data, we train and test five
different convolutional neural networks: a custom one to classify healthy and
AMD-affected eye fundi, and four well-known networks: ResNet50, ResNet101,
MobileNetV3, and UNet to segment (localize) the AMD lesions in the affected eye
fundus images. We achieve 93.55% accuracy or 69.71% Dice index as the
preliminary best results in segmentation with MobileNetV3.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, deep learning is widely applied to extract features for similarity
computation in person re-identification (re-ID) and have achieved great
success. However, due to the non-overlapping between training and testing IDs,
the difference between the data used for model training and the testing data
makes the performance of learned feature degraded during testing. Hence,
re-ranking is proposed to mitigate this issue and various algorithms have been
developed. However, most of existing re-ranking methods focus on replacing the
Euclidean distance with sophisticated distance metrics, which are not friendly
to downstream tasks and hard to be used for fast retrieval of massive data in
real applications. In this work, we propose a graph-based re-ranking method to
improve learned features while still keeping Euclidean distance as the
similarity metric. Inspired by graph convolution networks, we develop an
operator to propagate features over an appropriate graph. Since graph is the
essential key for the propagation, two important criteria are considered for
designing the graph, and three different graphs are explored accordingly.
Furthermore, a simple yet effective method is proposed to generate a profile
vector for each tracklet in videos, which helps extend our method to video
re-ID. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets, e.g., Market-1501,
Duke, and MARS, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

                                        <span>Bone marrow cytology is required to make a hematological diagnosis,
influencing critical clinical decision points in hematology. However, bone
marrow cytology is tedious, limited to experienced reference centers and
associated with high inter-observer variability. This may lead to a delayed or
incorrect diagnosis, leaving an unmet need for innovative supporting
technologies. We have developed the first ever end-to-end deep learning-based
technology for automated bone marrow cytology. Starting with a bone marrow
aspirate digital whole slide image, our technology rapidly and automatically
detects suitable regions for cytology, and subsequently identifies and
classifies all bone marrow cells in each region. This collective
cytomorphological information is captured in a novel representation called
Histogram of Cell Types (HCT) quantifying bone marrow cell class probability
distribution and acting as a cytological &quot;patient fingerprint&quot;. The approach
achieves high accuracy in region detection (0.97 accuracy and 0.99 ROC AUC),
and cell detection and cell classification (0.75 mAP, 0.78 F1-score,
Log-average miss rate of 0.31). HCT has potential to revolutionize
hematopathology diagnostic workflows, leading to more cost-effective, accurate
diagnosis and opening the door to precision medicine.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce TransformerFusion, a transformer-based 3D scene reconstruction
approach. From an input monocular RGB video, the video frames are processed by
a transformer network that fuses the observations into a volumetric feature
grid representing the scene; this feature grid is then decoded into an implicit
3D scene representation. Key to our approach is the transformer architecture
that enables the network to learn to attend to the most relevant image frames
for each 3D location in the scene, supervised only by the scene reconstruction
task. Features are fused in a coarse-to-fine fashion, storing fine-level
features only where needed, requiring lower memory storage and enabling fusion
at interactive rates. The feature grid is then decoded to a higher-resolution
scene reconstruction, using an MLP-based surface occupancy prediction from
interpolated coarse-to-fine 3D features. Our approach results in an accurate
surface reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-view stereo depth
estimation methods, fully-convolutional 3D reconstruction approaches, and
approaches using LSTM- or GRU-based recurrent networks for video sequence
fusion.</span>

                                        <span>The core for tackling the fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) is to
learn subtleyet discriminative features. Most previous works achieve this by
explicitly selecting thediscriminative parts or integrating the attention
mechanism via CNN-based approaches.However, these methods enhance the
computational complexity and make the modeldominated by the regions containing
the most of the objects. Recently, vision trans-former (ViT) has achieved SOTA
performance on general image recognition tasks. Theself-attention mechanism
aggregates and weights the information from all patches to theclassification
token, making it perfectly suitable for FGVC. Nonetheless, the classifi-cation
token in the deep layer pays more attention to the global information,
lackingthe local and low-level features that are essential for FGVC. In this
work, we proposea novel pure transformer-based framework Feature Fusion Vision
Transformer (FFVT)where we aggregate the important tokens from each transformer
layer to compensate thelocal, low-level and middle-level information. We design
a novel token selection mod-ule called mutual attention weight selection (MAWS)
to guide the network effectivelyand efficiently towards selecting
discriminative tokens without introducing extra param-eters. We verify the
effectiveness of FFVT on three benchmarks where FFVT achievesthe
state-of-the-art performance.</span>

organized by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), the American
Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), and the Medical Image Computing and Computer
Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society. Since its inception, BraTS has been
focusing on being a common benchmarking venue for brain glioma segmentation
algorithms, with well-curated multi-institutional multi-parametric magnetic
resonance imaging (mpMRI) data. Gliomas are the most common primary
malignancies of the central nervous system, with varying degrees of
aggressiveness and prognosis. The RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 challenge targets
the evaluation of computational algorithms assessing the same tumor
compartmentalization, as well as the underlying tumor&#x27;s molecular
characterization, in pre-operative baseline mpMRI data from 2,000 patients.
Specifically, the two tasks that BraTS 2021 focuses on are: a) the segmentation
of the histologically distinct brain tumor sub-regions, and b) the
classification of the tumor&#x27;s O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
promoter methylation status. The performance evaluation of all participating
algorithms in BraTS 2021 will be conducted through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse
platform (Task 1) and Kaggle (Task 2), concluding in distributing to the top
ranked participants monetary awards of $60,000 collectively.</span>

                                        <span>Various non-trivial spaces are becoming popular for embedding structured data
such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.</span>

                                        <span>Sequential recommendation systems model dynamic preferences of users based on
their historical interactions with platforms. Despite recent progress, modeling
short-term and long-term behavior of users in such systems is nontrivial and
challenging. To address this, we present a solution enhanced by a knowledge
graph called KATRec (Knowledge Aware aTtentive sequential Recommendations).
KATRec learns the short and long-term interests of users by modeling their
sequence of interacted items and leveraging pre-existing side information
through a knowledge graph attention network. Our novel knowledge graph-enhanced
sequential recommender contains item multi-relations at the entity-level and
users&#x27; dynamic sequences at the item-level. KATRec improves item representation
learning by considering higher-order connections and incorporating them in user
preference representation while recommending the next item. Experiments on
three public datasets show that KATRec outperforms state-of-the-art
recommendation models and demonstrates the importance of modeling both temporal
and side information to achieve high-quality recommendations.</span>

                                        <span>There is currently a gap between the natural language expression of scholarly
publications and their structured semantic content modeling to enable
intelligent content search. With the volume of research growing exponentially
every year, a search feature operating over semantically structured content is
compelling. The SemEval-2021 Shared Task NLPContributionGraph (a.k.a. &#x27;the NCG
task&#x27;) tasks participants to develop automated systems that structure
contributions from NLP scholarly articles in the English language. Being the
first-of-its-kind in the SemEval series, the task released structured data from
NLP scholarly articles at three levels of information granularity, i.e. at
sentence-level, phrase-level, and phrases organized as triples toward Knowledge
Graph (KG) building. The sentence-level annotations comprised the few sentences
about the article&#x27;s contribution. The phrase-level annotations were scientific
term and predicate phrases from the contribution sentences. Finally, the
triples constituted the research overview KG. For the Shared Task,
participating systems were then expected to automatically classify contribution
sentences, extract scientific terms and relations from the sentences, and
organize them as KG triples.

Overall, the task drew a strong participation demographic of seven teams and
27 participants. The best end-to-end task system classified contribution
sentences at 57.27% F1, phrases at 46.41% F1, and triples at 22.28% F1. While
the absolute performance to generate triples remains low, in the conclusion of
this article, the difficulty of producing such data and as a consequence of
modeling it is highlighted.</span>

                                        <span>Visually-aware recommendation on E-commerce platforms aims to leverage visual
information of items to predict a user&#x27;s preference. It is commonly observed
that user&#x27;s attention to visual features does not always reflect the real
preference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of a visual
satisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due
to the unsatisfaction of other essential features (e.g., brand, material,
price). We refer to the reason for such a visually related interaction
deviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware
models make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal
similarly to other features to directly predict the user&#x27;s preference without
considering a potential bias, which gives rise to a visually biased
recommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze
the visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual
feature of an item acts as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious
relationship between the user and the item. To eliminate this spurious
relationship that misleads the prediction of the user&#x27;s real preference, an
intervention and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator.
Particularly, the Total Indirect Effect is applied for a debiased prediction
during the testing phase of the model. This causal inference framework is model
agnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods. Furthermore,
we propose a debiased visually-aware recommender system, denoted as CausalRec
to effectively retain the supportive significance of the visual information and
remove the visual bias. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight benchmark
datasets, which shows the state-of-the-art performance of CausalRec and the
efficacy of debiasing.</span>

                                        <span>Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have
delivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and
discovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the
prior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet
distribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same
layer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose
sawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of
documents that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the
topics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are
represented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a
layer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic
embedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of
the layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares
components between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as
sawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is
constructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.
Experiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic
models on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document
representations.</span>

suffer from the streetlight effect, of analyzing the effect of only those
variables that have been measured and are therefore available for analysis. How
do we check whether all worthwhile variables have been instrumented and
considered when building an econometric development model? We attempt to
address this question by building unsupervised learning methods to identify and
rank news articles about diverse events occurring in different districts of
India, that can provide insights about what may have transpired in the
districts. This can help determine whether variables related to these events
are indeed available or not to model the development of these districts. We
also describe several other applications that emerge from this approach, such
as to use news articles to understand why pairs of districts that may have had
similar socio-economic indicators approximately ten years back ended up at
different levels of development currently, and another application that
generates a newsfeed of unusual news articles that do not conform to news
articles about typical districts with a similar socio-economic profile. These
applications outline the need for qualitative data to augment models based on
quantitative data, and are meant to open up research on new ways to mine

increased in the research community because applications have shown success in
different sectors such as security, marketing, heath-care, and others.
Recognition and identification of demographic traits such as gender, age,
location, or personality based on text data can help to improve different
marketing strategies. For instance it makes it possible to segment and to
personalize offers, thus products and services are exposed to the group of
greatest interest. This type of technology has been discussed widely in
documents from social media. However, the methods have been poorly studied in
data with a more formal structure, where there is no access to emoticons,
mentions, and other linguistic phenomena that are only present in social media.
This paper proposes the use of recurrent and convolutional neural networks, and
a transfer learning strategy for gender recognition in documents that are
written in informal and formal languages. Models are tested in two different
databases consisting of Tweets and call-center conversations. Accuracies of up
to 75\% are achieved for both databases. The results also indicate that it is
possible to transfer the knowledge from a system trained on a specific type of
expressions or idioms such as those typically used in social media into a more
formal type of text data, where the amount of data is more scarce and its
structure is completely different.</span>

However, changes of the system behavior over time due to internal or external
influences are challenging. Therefore, predictions of a previously learned
fore-casting model might not be useful anymore. In this paper, we present
EVent-triggered Augmented Refitting of Gaussian Process Regression for Seasonal
Data (EVARS-GPR), a novel online algorithm that is able to handle sudden shifts
in the target variable scale of seasonal data. For this purpose, EVARS-GPR
com-bines online change point detection with a refitting of the prediction
model using data augmentation for samples prior to a change point. Our
experiments on sim-ulated data show that EVARS-GPR is applicable for a wide
range of output scale changes. EVARS-GPR has on average a 20.8 % lower RMSE on
different real-world datasets compared to methods with a similar computational
resource con-sumption. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm leads to a
six-fold reduction of the averaged runtime in relation to all comparison
partners with a periodical refitting strategy. In summary, we present a
computationally efficient online fore-casting algorithm for seasonal time
series with changes of the target variable scale and demonstrate its
functionality on simulated as well as real-world data. All code is publicly

transfer clustering (DTC) when applied to the less variant data distribution.
Clustering can be considered as the most important unsupervised learning
problem. A simple definition of clustering can be stated as &quot;the process of
organizing objects into groups, whose members are similar in some way&quot;. Image
clustering is a crucial but challenging task in the domain machine learning and
computer vision. We have discussed the clustering of the data collection where
the data is less variant. We have discussed the improvement by using
attention-based classifiers rather than regular classifiers as the initial
feature extractors in the deep transfer clustering. We have enforced the model
to learn only the required region of interest in the images to get the
differentiable and robust features that do not take into account the
background. This paper is the improvement of the existing deep transfer
clustering for less variant data distribution.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we present a non-parametric structured latent variable model
for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent
canvas in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas.
Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior
distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable
&#x60;&#x60;what-to-draw&#x27;&#x27; per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves
the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in
the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a
Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used
in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to
pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show
that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like
DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models. Moreover,
we show that our model&#x27;s inherent compositionality and interpretability bring
significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing.

                                        <span>The universe is composed of galaxies that have diverse shapes. Once the
structure of a galaxy is determined, it is possible to obtain important
information about its formation and evolution. Morphologically classifying
galaxies means cataloging them according to their visual appearance and the
classification is linked to the physical properties of the galaxy. A
morphological classification made through visual inspection is subject to
biases introduced by subjective observations made by human volunteers. For this
reason, systematic, objective and easily reproducible classification of
galaxies has been gaining importance since the astronomer Edwin Hubble created
his famous classification method. In this work, we combine accurate visual
classifications of the Galaxy Zoo project with \emph {Deep Learning} methods.
The goal is to find an efficient technique at human performance level
classification, but in a systematic and automatic way, for classification of
elliptical and spiral galaxies. For this, a neural network model was created
through an Ensemble of four other convolutional models, allowing a greater
accuracy in the classification than what would be obtained with any one
individual. Details of the individual models and improvements made are also
described. The present work is entirely based on the analysis of images (not
parameter tables) from DR1 (www.datalab.noao.edu) of the Southern Photometric
Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). In terms of classification, we achieved, with
the Ensemble, an accuracy of $\approx 99 \%$ in the test sample (using
pre-trained networks).</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we show, for the well-studied problem of learning parity under
noise, where a learner tries to learn $x&#x3D;(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$ from a
stream of random linear equations over $\mathrm{F}_2$ that are correct with
probability $\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$ and flipped with probability
$\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$, that any learning algorithm requires either a memory
of size $\Omega(n^2/\varepsilon)$ or an exponential number of samples.

In fact, we study memory-sample lower bounds for a large class of learning
problems, as characterized by [GRT&#x27;18], when the samples are noisy. A matrix
$M: A \times X \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ corresponds to the following learning
problem with error parameter $\varepsilon$: an unknown element $x \in X$ is
chosen uniformly at random. A learner tries to learn $x$ from a stream of
samples, $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \ldots$, where for every $i$, $a_i \in A$ is
chosen uniformly at random and $b_i &#x3D; M(a_i,x)$ with probability
$1/2+\varepsilon$ and $b_i &#x3D; -M(a_i,x)$ with probability $1/2-\varepsilon$
($0&lt;\varepsilon&lt; \frac{1}{2}$). Assume that $k,\ell, r$ are such that any
submatrix of $M$ of at least $2^{-k} \cdot |A|$ rows and at least $2^{-\ell}
\cdot |X|$ columns, has a bias of at most $2^{-r}$. We show that any learning
algorithm for the learning problem corresponding to $M$, with error, requires
either a memory of size at least $\Omega\left(\frac{k \cdot \ell}{\varepsilon}
\right)$, or at least $2^{\Omega(r)}$ samples. In particular, this shows that
for a large class of learning problems, same as those in [GRT&#x27;18], any learning
algorithm requires either a memory of size at least $\Omega\left(\frac{(\log
|X|) \cdot (\log |A|)}{\varepsilon}\right)$ or an exponential number of noisy
samples.

Our proof is based on adapting the arguments in [Raz&#x27;17,GRT&#x27;18] to the noisy
case.</span>

allocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based
methods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate
data to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively
refine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability
of such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters
is not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize
mixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer
neurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster
distribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those
distributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of
clusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the
network end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as
the E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the
mixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with
existing representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when
mixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the
sole consistency optimization performance in clustering. Our trained networks
outperform single-stage deep clustering methods that still depend on k-means,
with unsupervised classification accuracy of 63.8% in STL10, 58% in CIFAR10,
25.9% in CIFAR100, and 98.9% in MNIST.</span>

contexts of deep learning ranging from robustness certification and
regularization to stability analysis of systems with neural network
controllers. Obtaining tight bounds of the Lipschitz constant is therefore
important. We introduce LipBaB, a branch and bound framework to compute
certified bounds of the local Lipschitz constant of deep neural networks with
ReLU activation functions up to any desired precision. We achieve this by
bounding the norm of the Jacobians, corresponding to different activation

                                        <span>Network data are ubiquitous in modern machine learning, with tasks of
interest including node classification, node clustering and link prediction. A
frequent approach begins by learning an Euclidean embedding of the network, to
which algorithms developed for vector-valued data are applied. For large
networks, embeddings are learned using stochastic gradient methods where the
sub-sampling scheme can be freely chosen. Despite the strong empirical
performance of such methods, they are not well understood theoretically. Our
work encapsulates representation methods using a subsampling approach, such as
node2vec, into a single unifying framework. We prove, under the assumption that
the graph is exchangeable, that the distribution of the learned embedding
vectors asymptotically decouples. Moreover, we characterize the asymptotic
distribution and provided rates of convergence, in terms of the latent
parameters, which includes the choice of loss function and the embedding
dimension. This provides a theoretical foundation to understand what the
embedding vectors represent and how well these methods perform on downstream
tasks. Notably, we observe that typically used loss functions may lead to
shortcomings, such as a lack of Fisher consistency.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm for enabling
collaboratively training deep learning models without sharing patient data.
However, the data from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across
institutions, which may reduce the performance of models trained using
federated learning. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware
federated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from
data heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods
that require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG
leverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to
encourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data
distribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated
learning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a
suite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the
performance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning
methods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data
heterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the
baseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the
accuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a
diabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction
dataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions. We conclude
that SplitAVG method can effectively overcome the performance drops from
variability in data distributions across institutions. Experimental results
also show that SplitAVG can be adapted to different base networks and
generalized to various types of medical imaging tasks.</span>

by the approximation strategy to address the challenges of local optimum of
classic and fractional graph neural networks which are specialised at
aggregating information from the feature and adjacent matrices of connected
nodes and their neighbours to solve learning tasks on non-Euclidean data such

methodological advances have contributed to significant gains in the
performance of stochastic simulation. In this paper, we focus on variance
reduction for matrix computations via matrix factorization. We provide insights
into existing variance reduction methods for estimating the entries of large
matrices. Popular methods do not exploit the reduction in variance that is
possible when the matrix is factorized. We show how computing the square root
factorization of the matrix can achieve in some important cases arbitrarily
better stochastic performance. In addition, we propose a factorized estimator
for the trace of a product of matrices and numerically demonstrate that the
estimator can be up to 1,000 times more efficient on certain problems of
estimating the log-likelihood of a Gaussian process. Additionally, we provide a
new estimator of the log-determinant of a positive semi-definite matrix where
the log-determinant is treated as a normalizing constant of a probability
density.</span>

                                        <span>Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been used successfully
in many conventional machine learning applications and is considered to be a
useful alternative to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a deep learning
optimizer. However, as an emerging domain, several challenges remain, including
1) The lack of global convergence guarantees, 2) Slow convergence towards
solutions, and 3) Cubic time complexity with regard to feature dimensions. In
this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for deep learning via
ADMM (dlADMM) to address these challenges simultaneously. The parameters in
each layer are updated backward and then forward so that the parameter
information in each layer is exchanged efficiently. The time complexity is
reduced from cubic to quadratic in (latent) feature dimensions via a dedicated
algorithm design for subproblems that enhances them utilizing iterative
quadratic approximations and backtracking. Finally, we provide the first proof
of global convergence for an ADMM-based method (dlADMM) in a deep neural
network problem under mild conditions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrated that our proposed dlADMM algorithm outperforms most of the
comparison methods.</span>

                                        <span>In many real-world problems, we want to infer some property of an expensive
black-box function $f$, given a budget of $T$ function evaluations. One example
is budget constrained global optimization of $f$, for which Bayesian
optimization is a popular method. Other properties of interest include local
optima, level sets, integrals, or graph-structured information induced by $f$.
Often, we can find an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ to compute the desired property,
but it may require far more than $T$ queries to execute. Given such an
$\mathcal{A}$, and a prior distribution over $f$, we refer to the problem of
inferring the output of $\mathcal{A}$ using $T$ evaluations as Bayesian
Algorithm Execution (BAX). To tackle this problem, we present a procedure,
InfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information
with respect to the algorithm&#x27;s output. Applying this to Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm,
for instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with
black-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian
optimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems,
InfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to $f$ than required by the original
algorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal
experimental design procedures such as entropy search methods and optimal
sensor placement using Gaussian processes.</span>

systems arising from Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and graph Laplacians
from machine learning applications. One of the key components of multigrid is
smoothing, which aims at reducing high-frequency errors on each grid level.
However, finding optimal smoothing algorithms is problem-dependent and can
impose challenges for many problems. In this paper, we propose an efficient
adaptive framework for learning optimized smoothers from operator stencils in
the form of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs are trained on
small-scale problems from a given type of PDEs based on a supervised loss
function derived from multigrid convergence theories, and can be applied to
large-scale problems of the same class of PDEs. Numerical results on
anisotropic rotated Laplacian problems demonstrate improved convergence rates
and solution time compared with classical hand-crafted relaxation methods.</span>

feature-additive explanation methods, previous analyses either invalidate or
support the role of attention-based explanations as a faithful and plausible
measure of salience. To investigate whether this approach is appropriate, we
compare LIME, Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT, Grad-SHAP, Deep-SHAP, and
attention-based explanations, applied to two neural architectures trained on
single- and pair-sequence language tasks. In most cases, we find that none of

Experiments on a public, real-life dataset are led here to evaluate carefully

methods. Our most surprising finding is that none of the methods we implemented
from the literature is better than a simple late fusion. Two important

                                        <span>Various non-trivial spaces are becoming popular for embedding structured data
such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.</span>

important and well-studied problems in the control field. Classic model-based
adaptive control methods can be applied only when a convenient model of the
plant or environment is provided. Recent model-free adaptive control methods
aim at removing this dependency by learning the physical characteristics of the
plant and/or process directly from sensor feedback. Although there have been
prior attempts at improving these techniques, it remains an open question as to
whether it is possible to cope with real-world uncertainties in a control
system that is fully based on either paradigm. We propose a conceptually simple
learning-based approach composed of a full state feedback controller, tuned
robustly by a deep reinforcement learning framework based on the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm. We compare it, in realistic simulations, to a
model-free controller that uses the same deep reinforcement learning framework
for the control of a micro aerial vehicle under wind gust. The results indicate
the great potential of learning-based adaptive control methods in modern
dynamical systems.</span>

                                        <span>Many decision-making processes involve solving a combinatorial optimization
problem with uncertain input that can be estimated from historic data.
Recently, problems in this class have been successfully addressed via
end-to-end learning approaches, which rely on solving one optimization problem
for each training instance at every epoch. In this context, we provide two
distinct contributions. First, we use a Noise Contrastive approach to motivate
a family of surrogate loss functions, based on viewing non-optimal solutions as
negative examples. Second, we address a major bottleneck of all
predict-and-optimize approaches, i.e. the need to frequently recompute optimal
solutions at training time. This is done via a solver-agnostic solution caching
scheme, and by replacing optimization calls with a lookup in the solution
cache. The method is formally based on an inner approximation of the feasible
space and, combined with a cache lookup strategy, provides a controllable
trade-off between training time and accuracy of the loss approximation. We
empirically show that even a very slow growth rate is enough to match the
quality of state-of-the-art methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.</span>

                                        <span>Properties of molecules are indicative of their functions and thus are useful
in many applications. With the advances of deep learning methods, computational
approaches for predicting molecular properties are gaining increasing momentum.
However, there lacks customized and advanced methods and comprehensive tools
for this task currently. Here we develop a suite of comprehensive machine
learning methods and tools spanning different computational models, molecular
representations, and loss functions for molecular property prediction and drug
discovery. Specifically, we represent molecules as both graphs and sequences.
Built on these representations, we develop novel deep models for learning from
molecular graphs and sequences. In order to learn effectively from highly
imbalanced datasets, we develop advanced loss functions that optimize areas
under precision-recall curves. Altogether, our work not only serves as a
comprehensive tool, but also contributes towards developing novel and advanced
graph and sequence learning methodologies. Results on both online and offline
antibiotics discovery and molecular property prediction tasks show that our
methods achieve consistent improvements over prior methods. In particular, our
methods achieve #1 ranking in terms of both ROC-AUC and PRC-AUC on the AI Cures
Open Challenge for drug discovery related to COVID-19. Our software is released
as part of the MoleculeX library under AdvProp.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of classification with rejection is to avoid risky misclassification
in error-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and product
inspection. In this paper, based on the relationship between classification
with rejection and cost-sensitive classification, we propose a novel method of
classification with rejection by learning an ensemble of cost-sensitive
classifiers, which satisfies all the following properties: (i) it can avoid
estimating class-posterior probabilities, resulting in improved classification
accuracy, (ii) it allows a flexible choice of losses including non-convex ones,
(iii) it does not require complicated modifications when using different
losses, (iv) it is applicable to both binary and multiclass cases, and (v) it
is theoretically justifiable for any classification-calibrated loss.
Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approach in
clean-labeled, noisy-labeled, and positive-unlabeled classification.</span>

                                        <span>In many coordination problems, independently reasoning humans are able to
discover mutually compatible policies. In contrast, independently trained
self-play policies are often mutually incompatible. Zero-shot coordination
(ZSC) has recently been proposed as a new frontier in multi-agent reinforcement
learning to address this fundamental issue. Prior work approaches the ZSC
problem by assuming players can agree on a shared learning algorithm but not on
labels for actions and observations, and proposes other-play as an optimal
solution. However, until now, this &quot;label-free&quot; problem has only been
informally defined. We formalize this setting as the label-free coordination
(LFC) problem by defining the label-free coordination game. We show that
other-play is not an optimal solution to the LFC problem as it fails to
consistently break ties between incompatible maximizers of the other-play
objective. We introduce an extension of the algorithm, other-play with
tie-breaking, and prove that it is optimal in the LFC problem and an
equilibrium in the LFC game. Since arbitrary tie-breaking is precisely what the
ZSC setting aims to prevent, we conclude that the LFC problem does not reflect
the aims of ZSC. To address this, we introduce an alternative informal
operationalization of ZSC as a starting point for future work.</span>

publications and their structured semantic content modeling to enable
intelligent content search. With the volume of research growing exponentially
every year, a search feature operating over semantically structured content is
compelling. The SemEval-2021 Shared Task NLPContributionGraph (a.k.a. &#x27;the NCG
task&#x27;) tasks participants to develop automated systems that structure
contributions from NLP scholarly articles in the English language. Being the
first-of-its-kind in the SemEval series, the task released structured data from
NLP scholarly articles at three levels of information granularity, i.e. at
sentence-level, phrase-level, and phrases organized as triples toward Knowledge
Graph (KG) building. The sentence-level annotations comprised the few sentences
about the article&#x27;s contribution. The phrase-level annotations were scientific
term and predicate phrases from the contribution sentences. Finally, the
triples constituted the research overview KG. For the Shared Task,
participating systems were then expected to automatically classify contribution
sentences, extract scientific terms and relations from the sentences, and
organize them as KG triples.

Overall, the task drew a strong participation demographic of seven teams and
27 participants. The best end-to-end task system classified contribution
sentences at 57.27% F1, phrases at 46.41% F1, and triples at 22.28% F1. While
the absolute performance to generate triples remains low, in the conclusion of
this article, the difficulty of producing such data and as a consequence of
modeling it is highlighted.</span>

                                        <span>Clinical finding summaries from an orthopantomogram, or a dental panoramic
radiograph, have significant potential to improve patient communication and
speed up clinical judgments. While orthopantomogram is a first-line tool for
dental examinations, no existing work has explored the summarization of
findings from it. A finding summary has to find teeth in the imaging study and
label the teeth with several types of past treatments. To tackle the problem,
we developDeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional
segmentation and tooth localization, the latter of which is further refined by
a novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to
improve detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments
show high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall
AUC of 88.2% in detecting six types of findings. The proposed dental coherence
and weak supervision both are shown to improve DeepOPG by adding 5.9% and 0.4%
to AP@IoU&#x3D;0.5.</span>

when using these models to suggest new protein designs, one must deal with the

a sequence-to-function machine-learning surrogate model to select sequences for
experimental measurement. First, we discuss how to select sequences through a

this problem, without fully eliminating it. Recently, the Maxmin and Ensemble
Q-learning algorithms have used different estimates provided by the ensembles
of learners to reduce the overestimation bias. Unfortunately, these learners
can converge to the same point in the parametric or representation space,
falling back to the classic single neural network DQN. In this paper, we
describe a regularization technique to maximize ensemble diversity in these
algorithms. We propose and compare five regularization functions inspired from
economics theory and consensus optimization. We show that the regularized

                                        <span>A real-world graph has a complex topological structure, which is often formed
by the interaction of different latent factors. Disentanglement of these latent
factors can effectively improve the robustness and expressiveness of node
representation of graph. However, most existing methods lack consideration of
the intrinsic differences in relations between nodes caused by factor
entanglement. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Disentangled Graph
Convolutional Network (ADGCN) for disentangled graph representation learning.
Specifically, a component-specific aggregation approach is proposed to achieve
micro-disentanglement by inferring latent components that caused the links
between nodes. On the basis of micro-disentanglement, we further propose a
macro-disentanglement adversarial regularizer to improve the separability among
component distributions, thus restricting the interdependence among components.
Additionally, to reveal the topological graph structure, a diversity-preserving
node sampling approach is proposed, by which the graph structure can be
progressively refined in a way of local structure awareness. The experimental
results on various real-world graph data verify that our ADGCN obtains more
favorable performance over currently available alternatives.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a set-valued online prediction problem in the context of network
caching. Assume that multiple users are connected to several caches via a
bipartite network. At any time slot, each user requests an arbitrary file
chosen from a large catalog. A user&#x27;s request at a slot is met if the requested
file is cached in at least one of the caches connected to the user. Our
objective is to predict, prefetch, and optimally distribute the files on the
caches to maximize the total number of cache hits in an online setting. The
problem is non-trivial due to the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the
objective function. In this paper, we propose $\texttt{LeadCache}$ - an online
caching policy based on the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader paradigm. We show that
the policy is regret-optimal up to a factor of $\tilde{O}(n^{3/8}),$ where $n$
is the number of users. We design two efficient implementations of the
$\texttt{LeadCache}$ policy, one based on Pipage rounding and the other based
on Madow&#x27;s sampling, each of which makes precisely one call to an LP-solver per
iteration. With a Strong-Law-type assumption, we show that the total number of
file fetches under $\texttt{LeadCache}$ remains almost surely finite over an
infinite horizon. Finally, we derive a tight regret lower bound using results
from graph coloring. We conclude that the learning-based $\texttt{LeadCache}$
policy decisively outperforms the known caching policies both theoretically and
empirically.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks have achieved success in a wide array of perceptual tasks but
often fail at tasks involving both perception and higher-level reasoning. On
these more challenging tasks, bespoke approaches (such as modular symbolic
components, independent dynamics models or semantic parsers) targeted towards
that specific type of task have typically performed better. The downside to
these targeted approaches, however, is that they can be more brittle than
general-purpose neural networks, requiring significant modification or even
redesign according to the particular task at hand. Here, we propose a more
general neural-network-based approach to dynamic visual reasoning problems that
obtains state-of-the-art performance on three different domains, in each case
outperforming bespoke modular approaches tailored specifically to the task. Our
method relies on learned object-centric representations, self-attention and
self-supervised dynamics learning, and all three elements together are required
for strong performance to emerge. The success of this combination suggests that
there may be no need to trade off flexibility for performance on problems
involving spatio-temporal or causal-style reasoning. With the right soft biases
and learning objectives in a neural network we may be able to attain the best
of both worlds.</span>

learning algorithm but is significantly less utilized than off-policy learning
algorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due the belief that on-policy
methods are significantly less sample efficient than their off-policy
counterparts in multi-agent problems. In this work, we investigate Multi-Agent
PPO (MAPPO), a variant of PPO which is specialized for multi-agent settings.
Using a 1-GPU desktop, we show that MAPPO achieves surprisingly strong
performance in three popular multi-agent testbeds: the particle-world
environments, the Starcraft multi-agent challenge, and the Hanabi challenge,
with minimal hyperparameter tuning and without any domain-specific algorithmic
modifications or architectures. In the majority of environments, we find that
compared to off-policy baselines, MAPPO achieves strong results while
exhibiting comparable sample efficiency. Finally, through ablation studies, we
present the implementation and algorithmic factors which are most influential

                                        <span>Energy forecasting has a vital role to play in smart grid (SG) systems
involving various applications such as demand-side management, load shedding,
and optimum dispatch. Managing efficient forecasting while ensuring the least
possible prediction error is one of the main challenges posed in the grid
today, considering the uncertainty and granularity in SG data. This paper
presents a comprehensive and application-oriented review of state-of-the-art
forecasting methods for SG systems along with recent developments in
probabilistic deep learning (PDL) considering different models and
architectures. Traditional point forecasting methods including statistical,
machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are extensively investigated in
terms of their applicability to energy forecasting. In addition, the
significance of hybrid and data pre-processing techniques to support
forecasting performance is also studied. A comparative case study using the
Victorian electricity consumption and American electric power (AEP) datasets is
conducted to analyze the performance of point and probabilistic forecasting
methods. The analysis demonstrates higher accuracy of the long-short term
memory (LSTM) models with appropriate hyper-parameter tuning among point
forecasting methods especially when sample sizes are larger and involve
nonlinear patterns with long sequences. Furthermore, Bayesian bidirectional
LSTM (BLSTM) as a probabilistic method exhibit the highest accuracy in terms of
least pinball score and root mean square error (RMSE).</span>

noisy, missing, discretized, or privatized. The standard workflow for empirical
research involves data cleaning followed by data analysis that typically
ignores the bias and variance consequences of data cleaning. We formulate a
semiparametric model for causal inference with corrupted data to encompass both
data cleaning and data analysis. We propose a new end-to-end procedure for data
cleaning, estimation, and inference with data cleaning-adjusted confidence
intervals. We prove root-n consistency, Gaussian approximation, and
semiparametric efficiency for our estimator of the causal parameter by finite
sample arguments. Our key assumption is that the true covariates are
approximately low rank. In our analysis, we provide nonasymptotic theoretical
contributions to matrix completion, statistical learning, and semiparametric
statistics. We verify the coverage of the data cleaning-adjusted confidence

                                        <span>Operator inference learns low-dimensional dynamical-system models with
polynomial nonlinear terms from trajectories of high-dimensional physical
systems (non-intrusive model reduction). This work focuses on the large class
of physical systems that can be well described by models with quadratic
nonlinear terms and proposes a regularizer for operator inference that induces
a stability bias onto quadratic models. The proposed regularizer is physics
informed in the sense that it penalizes quadratic terms with large norms and so
explicitly leverages the quadratic model form that is given by the underlying
physics. This means that the proposed approach judiciously learns from data and
physical insights combined, rather than from either data or physics alone.
Additionally, a formulation of operator inference is proposed that enforces
model constraints for preserving structure such as symmetry and definiteness in
the linear terms. Numerical results demonstrate that models learned with
operator inference and the proposed regularizer and structure preservation are
accurate and stable even in cases where using no regularization or Tikhonov
regularization leads to models that are unstable.</span>

step decision making processes. In this work, we initiate the development of
methods to find counterfactual explanations for decision making processes in
which multiple, dependent actions are taken sequentially over time. We start by
formally characterizing a sequence of actions and states using finite horizon
Markov decision processes and the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Building
upon this characterization, we formally state the problem of finding
counterfactual explanations for sequential decision making processes. In our
problem formulation, the counterfactual explanation specifies an alternative
sequence of actions differing in at most k actions from the observed sequence
that could have led the observed process realization to a better outcome. Then,
we introduce a polynomial time algorithm based on dynamic programming to build
a counterfactual policy that is guaranteed to always provide the optimal
counterfactual explanation on every possible realization of the counterfactual
environment dynamics. We validate our algorithm using both synthetic and real
data from cognitive behavioral therapy and show that the counterfactual
explanations our algorithm finds can provide valuable insights to enhance
sequential decision making under uncertainty.</span>

intention of conveying a specific meaning, can be considered as a hand gesture.
Inputs to hand gesture recognition systems can be in several forms, such as
depth images, monocular RGB, or skeleton joint points. We observe that raw
depth images possess low contrasts in the hand regions of interest (ROI). They
do not highlight important details to learn, such as finger bending information
(whether a finger is overlapping the palm, or another finger). Recently, in
deep-learning--based dynamic hand gesture recognition, researchers are tying to
fuse different input modalities (e.g. RGB or depth images and hand skeleton
joint points) to improve the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we focus on
dynamic hand gesture (DHG) recognition using depth quantized image features and
hand skeleton joint points. In particular, we explore the effect of using
depth-quantized features in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) based multi-modal fusion networks. We find that our method
improves existing results on the SHREC-DHG-14 dataset. Furthermore, using our
method, we show that it is possible to reduce the resolution of the input
images by more than four times and still obtain comparable or better accuracy
to that of the resolutions used in previous methods.</span>

for world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging
visual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted
attention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels
for language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from
approximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary
diversity of a small image-text dataset. To overcome these limitations, we
present VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation method for improving
language understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher model on a video-text
dataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student language model with a
text dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to use different
knowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a large-scale
video-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In our
experiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only language
models and vokenization models, on several downstream language understanding
tasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the improved world
knowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning capabilities of our model
by evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Lastly, we
present comprehensive ablation studies as well as visualizations of the learned
text-to-video grounding results of our teacher and student language models. Our

                                        <span>Hyperspectral pansharpening aims to synthesize a low-resolution hyperspectral
image (LR-HSI) with a registered panchromatic image (PAN) to generate an
enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution. Recently proposed HS
pansharpening methods have obtained remarkable results using deep convolutional
networks (ConvNets), which typically consist of three steps: (1) up-sampling
the LR-HSI, (2) predicting the residual image via a ConvNet, and (3) obtaining
the final fused HSI by adding the outputs from first and second steps. Recent
methods have leveraged Deep Image Prior (DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to
its excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral information,
without learning from large data sets. However, we observed that the quality of
up-sampled HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional
spatial-domain constraint to the conventional spectral-domain energy function.
We define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance between the
predicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the
up-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).
Moreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the
reference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures. In
order to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete
network, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by
constraining the receptive from increasing in the deep layers. We perform
experiments on three HSI datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our
DIP-HyperKite over the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. The deployment
codes, pre-trained models, and final fusion outputs of our DIP-HyperKite and
the methods used for the comparisons will be publicly made available at

affects farmers&#x27; decisions on timing, placement, and quantity of fertilizers
applied in the farms. Most existing methods to measure soil health indicators
(SHIs) are in-lab wet chemistry or spectroscopy-based methods, which require
significant human input and effort, time-consuming, costly, and are
low-throughput in nature. To address this challenge, we develop an artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven near real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based
multispectral sensing (UMS) solution to estimate total nitrogen (TN) of the
soil, an important macro-nutrient or SHI that directly affects the crop health.
Accurate prediction of soil TN can significantly increase crop yield through
informed decision making on the timing of seed planting, and fertilizer
quantity and timing. We train two machine learning models including multi-layer
perceptron and support vector machine to predict the soil nitrogen using a
suite of data classes including multispectral characteristics of the soil and
crops in red, near-infrared, and green spectral bands, computed vegetation
indices, and environmental variables including air temperature and relative
humidity. To generate the ground-truth data or the training data for the
machine learning models, we measure the total nitrogen of the soil samples

                                        <span>Consider the problem of learning a large number of response functions
simultaneously based on the same input variables. The training data consist of
a single independent random sample of the input variables drawn from a common
distribution together with the associated responses. The input variables are
mapped into a high-dimensional linear space, called the feature space, and the
response functions are modelled as linear functionals of the mapped features,
with coefficients calibrated via ordinary least squares. We provide convergence
guarantees on the worst-case excess prediction risk by controlling the
convergence rate of the excess risk uniformly in the response function. The
dimension of the feature map is allowed to tend to infinity with the sample
size. The collection of response functions, although potentially infinite, is
supposed to have a finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. The bound derived can
be applied when building multiple surrogate models in a reasonable computing
time.</span>

                                        <span>Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and general-purpose robots are
safety-critical systems that operate in highly uncertain and dynamic
environments. We propose an interactive multi-agent framework where the
system-under-design is modeled as an ego agent and its environment is modeled
by a number of adversarial (ado) agents. For example, a self-driving car is an
ego agent whose behavior is influenced by ado agents such as pedestrians,
bicyclists, traffic lights, road geometry etc. Given a logical specification of
the correct behavior of the ego agent, and a set of constraints that encode
reasonable adversarial behavior, our framework reduces the adversarial testing
problem to the problem of synthesizing controllers for (constrained) ado agents
that cause the ego agent to violate its specifications. Specifically, we
explore the use of tabular and deep reinforcement learning approaches for
synthesizing adversarial agents. We show that ado agents trained in this
fashion are better than traditional falsification or testing techniques because
they can generalize to ego agents and environments that differ from the
original ego agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on two
real-world case studies from the domain of self-driving cars.</span>

                                        <span>The increasing size of neural network models has been critical for
improvements in their accuracy, but device memory is not growing at the same
rate. This creates fundamental challenges for training neural networks within
limited memory environments. In this work, we propose ActNN, a memory-efficient
training framework that stores randomly quantized activations for back
propagation. We prove the convergence of ActNN for general network
architectures, and we characterize the impact of quantization on the
convergence via an exact expression for the gradient variance. Using our
theory, we propose novel mixed-precision quantization strategies that exploit
the activation&#x27;s heterogeneity across feature dimensions, samples, and layers.
These techniques can be readily applied to existing dynamic graph frameworks,
such as PyTorch, simply by substituting the layers. We evaluate ActNN on
mainstream computer vision models for classification, detection, and
segmentation tasks. On all these tasks, ActNN compresses the activation to 2
bits on average, with negligible accuracy loss. ActNN reduces the memory
footprint of the activation by 12x, and it enables training with a 6.6x to 14x
larger batch size.</span>

improves generalisation. Despite the growing popularity of this approach, a
precise characterisation of the generalisation benefit is lacking. By
considering the simplest case of linear models, this paper provides the first
provably non-zero improvement in generalisation for invariant/equivariant
models when the target distribution is invariant/equivariant with respect to a
compact group. Moreover, our work reveals an interesting relationship between
generalisation, the number of training examples and properties of the group
action. Our results rest on an observation of the structure of function spaces
under averaging operators which, along with its consequences for feature
averaging, may be of independent interest.</span>

across a number of scientific and engineering fields. In a previous work
[arXiv:2104.13962], we explored the use of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODE) as a non-intrusive method for propagating the latent-space
dynamics in reduced order models. Here, we investigate employing deep
autoencoders for discovering the reduced basis representation, the dynamics of
which are then approximated by NODE. The ability of deep autoencoders to
represent the latent-space is compared to the traditional proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) approach, again in conjunction with NODE for capturing the
dynamics. Additionally, we compare their behavior with two classical
non-intrusive methods based on POD and radial basis function interpolation as
well as dynamic mode decomposition. The test problems we consider include
incompressible flow around a cylinder as well as a real-world application of
shallow water hydrodynamics in an estuarine system. Our findings indicate that
deep autoencoders can leverage nonlinear manifold learning to achieve a highly
efficient compression of spatial information and define a latent-space that
appears to be more suitable for capturing the temporal dynamics through the
NODE framework.</span>

                                        <span>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool in statistics and
machine learning. While existing study of PCA focuses on the recovery of
principal components and their associated eigenvalues, there are few precise
characterizations of individual principal component scores that yield
low-dimensional embedding of samples. That hinders the analysis of various
spectral methods. In this paper, we first develop an $\ell_p$ perturbation
theory for a hollowed version of PCA in Hilbert spaces which provably improves
upon the vanilla PCA in the presence of heteroscedastic noises. Through a novel
$\ell_p$ analysis of eigenvectors, we investigate entrywise behaviors of
principal component score vectors and show that they can be approximated by
linear functionals of the Gram matrix in $\ell_p$ norm, which includes $\ell_2$
and $\ell_\infty$ as special examples. For sub-Gaussian mixture models, the
choice of $p$ giving optimal bounds depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, which
further yields optimality guarantees for spectral clustering. For contextual
community detection, the $\ell_p$ theory leads to a simple spectral algorithm
that achieves the information threshold for exact recovery. These also provide
optimal recovery results for Gaussian mixture and stochastic block models as
special cases.</span>

Intelligence (AI) communities. In the former case, models of software, which
may specify the software system architecture on different levels of abstraction
could be used in various stages of the Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC),
from early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation,
testing and evolution. However, in the latter case, i.e., AI, models may
provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision making support. For
instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is the most popular sub-discipline of
AI at the present time, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the
observed data instances and can become capable of making better predictions or
recommendations in the future. The goal of this work is to create synergy by
bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic
approach. We illustrate how software models can become capable of producing or
dealing with data analytics and ML models. The main focus is on the Internet of

and model-driven (model-based) SE play a key role. In particular, we implement

                                        <span>We address the problem of teaching a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent
to follow instructions in multi-task environments. Instructions are expressed
in a well-known formal language -- linear temporal logic (LTL) -- and can
specify a diversity of complex, temporally extended behaviours, including
conditionals and alternative realizations. Our proposed learning approach
exploits the compositional syntax and the semantics of LTL, enabling our RL
agent to learn task-conditioned policies that generalize to new instructions,
not observed during training. To reduce the overhead of learning LTL semantics,
we introduce an environment-agnostic LTL pretraining scheme which improves
sample-efficiency in downstream environments. Experiments on discrete and
continuous domains target combinatorial task sets of up to $\sim10^{39}$ unique
tasks and demonstrate the strength of our approach in learning to solve
(unseen) tasks, given LTL instructions.</span>

                                        <span>Due to a high heterogeneity in pose and size and to a limited number of
available data, segmentation of pediatric images is challenging for deep
learning methods. In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose
and scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our
architecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated
together during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity
matrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable
module to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module,
based on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the
original UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and
scale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module
learns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size.
Furthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows
saving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test
the proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal
pediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization
of size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard
data-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney
(88.01\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\%
to 87.12\%).</span>

dynamical systems through a deep learning approach. Focusing mainly on
second-order, linear time-invariant dynamical systems, the topic of damping
factor identification is studied. By utilizing a six-layer deep neural network
with different recurrent cells, namely GRUs, LSTMs or BiLSTMs; and by feeding
input-output sequence pairs captured from a dynamical system simulator, we
search for an effective deep recurrent architecture in order to resolve damping
factor identification problem. Our study results show that, although previously
not utilized for this task in the literature, bidirectional gated recurrent
cells (BiLSTMs) provide better parameter identification results when compared
to unidirectional gated recurrent memory cells such as GRUs and LSTM. Thus,
indicating that an input-output sequence pair of finite length, collected from
a dynamical system and when observed anachronistically, may carry information
in both time directions for prediction of a dynamical systems parameter.</span>

popular. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) mainly refers to the automated
methods for model selection and hyper-parameter optimization of various
algorithms such as random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, etc. In
this paper, we introduce a new package i.e. DriveML for automated machine
learning. DriveML helps in implementing some of the pillars of an automated
machine learning pipeline such as automated data preparation, feature
engineering, model building and model explanation by running the function
instead of writing lengthy R codes. The DriveML package is available in CRAN.
We compare the DriveML package with other relevant packages in CRAN/Github and
find that DriveML performs the best across different parameters. We also
provide an illustration by applying the DriveML package with default
configuration on a real world dataset. Overall, the main benefits of DriveML
are in development time savings, reduce developer&#x27;s errors, optimal tuning of
machine learning models and reproducibility.</span>

structure modeling in an effective way. However, the performance of existing
GNNs would decrease significantly when they stack many layers, because of the
over-smoothing issue. Node embeddings tend to converge to similar vectors when
GNNs keep recursively aggregating the representations of neighbors. To enable
deep GNNs, several methods have been explored recently. But they are developed
from either techniques in convolutional neural networks or heuristic
strategies. There is no generalizable and theoretical principle to guide the
design of deep GNNs. To this end, we analyze the bottleneck of deep GNNs by
leveraging the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings, and propose a generalizable
principle to guide the training of deep GNNs. Based on it, a novel deep GNN
framework -- EGNN is designed. It could provide lower and upper constraints in
terms of Dirichlet energy at each layer to avoid over-smoothing. Experimental
results demonstrate that EGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance by using
deep layers.</span>

                                        <span>Quantum annealing is a promising paradigm for building practical quantum
computers. Compared to other approaches, quantum annealing technology has been
scaled up to a larger number of qubits. On the other hand, deep learning has
been profoundly successful in pushing the boundaries of AI. It is thus natural
to investigate potentially game changing technologies such as quantum annealers
to augment the capabilities of deep learning. In this work, we explore binary
neural networks, which are lightweight yet powerful models typically intended
for resource constrained devices. Departing from current training regimes for
binary networks that smooth/approximate the activation functions to make the
network differentiable, we devise a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
formulation for the training problem. While the problem is intractable, i.e.,
the cost to estimate the binary weights scales exponentially with network size,
we show how the problem can be optimized directly on a quantum annealer,
thereby opening up to the potential gains of quantum computing. We
experimentally validated our formulation via simulation and testing on an
actual quantum annealer (D-Wave Advantage), the latter to the extent allowable
by the capacity of current technology.</span>

                                        <span>General Value Function (GVF) is a powerful tool to represent both the {\em
predictive} and {\em retrospective} knowledge in reinforcement learning (RL).
In practice, often multiple interrelated GVFs need to be evaluated jointly with
pre-collected off-policy samples. In the literature, the gradient temporal
difference (GTD) learning method has been adopted to evaluate GVFs in the
off-policy setting, but such an approach may suffer from a large estimation
error even if the function approximation class is sufficiently expressive.
Moreover, none of the previous work have formally established the convergence
guarantee to the ground truth GVFs under the function approximation settings.
In this paper, we address both issues through the lens of a class of GVFs with
causal filtering, which cover a wide range of RL applications such as reward
variance, value gradient, cost in anomaly detection, stationary distribution
gradient, etc. We propose a new algorithm called GenTD for off-policy GVFs
evaluation and show that GenTD learns multiple interrelated multi-dimensional
GVFs as efficiently as a single canonical scalar value function. We further
show that unlike GTD, the learned GVFs by GenTD are guaranteed to converge to
the ground truth GVFs as long as the function approximation power is
sufficiently large. To our best knowledge, GenTD is the first off-policy GVF
evaluation algorithm that has global optimality guarantee.</span>

which selects a sequence of training points that are &quot;just right&quot;. We propose
an information-theoretic acquisition function -- the reducible validation loss
-- and compute it with a small proxy model -- GoldiProx -- to efficiently
choose training points that maximize information about a validation set. We
show that the &quot;hard&quot; (e.g. high loss) points usually selected in the
optimization literature are typically noisy, while the &quot;easy&quot; (e.g. low noise)
samples often prioritized for curriculum learning confer less information.
Further, points with uncertain labels, typically targeted by active learning,
tend to be less relevant to the task. In contrast, Goldilocks Selection chooses
points that are &quot;just right&quot; and empirically outperforms the above approaches.
Moreover, the selected sequence can transfer to other architectures;
practitioners can share and reuse it without the need to recreate it.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) is capable of performing large distributed machine
learning tasks across multiple edge users by periodically aggregating trained
local parameters. To address key challenges of enabling FL over a wireless
fog-cloud system (e.g., non-i.i.d. data, users&#x27; heterogeneity), we first
propose an efficient FL algorithm (called FedFog) to perform the local
aggregation of gradient parameters at fog servers and global training update at
the cloud. Next, we employ FedFog in wireless fog-cloud systems by
investigating a novel network-aware FL optimization problem that strikes the
balance between the global loss and completion time. An iterative algorithm is
then developed to obtain a precise measurement of the system performance, which
helps design an efficient stopping criteria to output an appropriate number of
global rounds. To mitigate the straggler effect, we propose a flexible user
aggregation strategy that trains fast users first to obtain a certain level of
accuracy before allowing slow users to join the global training updates.
Extensive numerical results using several real-world FL tasks are provided to
verify the theoretical convergence of FedFog. We also show that the proposed
co-design of FL and communication is essential to substantially improve
resource utilization while achieving comparable accuracy of the learning model.</span>

                                        <span>Tabular generative adversarial networks (TGAN) have recently emerged to cater
to the need of synthesizing tabular data -- the most widely used data format.
While synthetic tabular data offers the advantage of complying with privacy
regulations, there still exists a risk of privacy leakage via inference attacks
due to interpolating the properties of real data during training. Differential
private (DP) training algorithms provide theoretical guarantees for training
machine learning models by injecting statistical noise to prevent privacy
leaks. However, the challenges of applying DP on TGAN are to determine the most
optimal framework (i.e., PATE/DP-SGD) and neural network (i.e.,
Generator/Discriminator)to inject noise such that the data utility is well
maintained under a given privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose DTGAN, a
novel conditional Wasserstein tabular GAN that comes in two variants DTGAN_G
and DTGAN_D, for providing a detailed comparison of tabular GANs trained using
DP-SGD for the generator vs discriminator, respectively. We elicit the privacy
analysis associated with training the generator with complex loss functions
(i.e., classification and information losses) needed for high quality tabular
data synthesis. Additionally, we rigorously evaluate the theoretical privacy
guarantees offered by DP empirically against membership and attribute inference
attacks. Our results on 3 datasets show that the DP-SGD framework is superior
to PATE and that a DP discriminator is more optimal for training convergence.
Thus, we find (i) DTGAN_D is capable of maintaining the highest data utility
across 4 ML models by up to 18% in terms of the average precision score for a
strict privacy budget, epsilon &#x3D; 1, as compared to the prior studies and (ii)
DP effectively prevents privacy loss against inference attacks by restricting
the success probability of membership attacks to be close to 50%.</span>

models with feature representations that generalize better. However, limited
works have been done on adversarial training of models on graph data. In this
paper, we raise such a question { does adversarial training improve the
generalization of graph representations. We formulate L2 and L1 versions of
adversarial training in two powerful node embedding methods: graph autoencoder

graph anomaly detection of GAE and VGAE, and demonstrate that both L2 and L1

to fixed environments. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for
adaptive RL, called AdaRL, that adapts reliably to changes across domains.
Specifically, we construct a generative environment model for the structural
relationships among variables in the system and embed the changes in a compact
way, which provides a clear and interpretable picture for locating what and
where the changes are and how to adapt. Based on the environment model, we
characterize a minimal set of representations, including both domain-specific
factors and domain-shared state representations, that suffice for reliable and
low-cost transfer. Moreover, we show that by explicitly leveraging a compact
representation to encode changes, we can adapt the policy with only a few
samples without further policy optimization in the target domain. We illustrate
the efficacy of AdaRL through a series of experiments that allow for changes in
different components of Cartpole and Atari games.</span>

catching a ball. A classification of clinical catching trials might give
insight into the existence of pathological alterations in the relation of arm
and ball movements. Accurate, but also early decisions are required to classify
a catching attempt before the catcher&#x27;s first ball contact. To obtain
clinically valuable results, a significant decision confidence of at least 75%
is required. Hence, three competing objectives have to be optimized at the same
time: accuracy, earliness and decision-making confidence. Here we propose a
coupled classification and prediction approach for early time series
classification: a predictive, generative recurrent neural network (RNN)
forecasts the next data points of ball trajectories based on already available
observations; a discriminative RNN continuously generates classification
guesses based on the available data points and the unrolled sequence
predictions. We compare our approach, which we refer to as predictive
sequential classification (PSC), to state-of-the-art sequence learners,
including various RNN and temporal convolutional network (TCN) architectures.
On this hard real-world task we can consistently demonstrate the superiority of
PSC over all other models in terms of accuracy and confidence with respect to
earliness of recognition. Specifically, PSC is able to confidently classify the
success of catching trials as early as 123 milliseconds before the first ball
contact. We conclude that PSC is a promising approach for early time series
classification, when accurate and confident decisions are required.</span>

grid instability. One promising strategy is to employ data in power grids to
efficiently respond to abnormal events (e.g., faults) by detection and
location. Unfortunately, most existing works lack physical interpretation and
are vulnerable to the practical challenges: sparse observation, insufficient
labeled datasets, and stochastic environment. We propose a physics-informed
graph learning framework of two stages to handle these challenges when locating
faults. Stage- I focuses on informing a graph neural network (GNN) with the
geometrical structure of power grids; stage-II employs the physical similarity
of labeled and unlabeled data samples to improve the location accuracy. We
provide a random walk-based the underpinning of designing our GNNs to address
the challenge of sparse observation and augment the correct prediction
probability. We compare our approach with three baselines in the IEEE 123-node
benchmark system, showing that the proposed method outperforms the others by
significant margins, especially when label rates are low. Also, we validate the
robustness of our algorithms to out-of-distribution-data (ODD) due to topology
changes and load variations. Additionally, we adapt our graph learning
framework to the IEEE 37-node test feeder and show high location performance
with the proposed training strategy.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of determining the best intervention in a Causal
Bayesian Network (CBN) specified only by its causal graph. We model this as a
stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where the
interventions correspond to the arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose
a simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a semi-Markovian
causal graph with atomic interventions and possibly unobservable variables, and
achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{M/T})$ expected simple regret, where $M$ is dependent
on the input CBN and could be very small compared to the number of arms. We
also show that this is almost optimal for CBNs described by causal graphs
having an $n$-ary tree structure. Our simple regret minimization results, both
upper and lower bound, subsume previous results in the literature, which
assumed additional structural restrictions on the input causal graph. In
particular, our results indicate that the simple regret guarantee of our
proposed algorithm can only be improved by considering more nuanced structural
restrictions on the causal graph. Next, we propose a cumulative regret
minimization algorithm that takes as input a general causal graph with all
observable nodes and atomic interventions and performs better than the optimal
MAB algorithm that does not take causal side-information into account. We also
experimentally compare both our algorithms with the best known algorithms in
the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work gives the first simple
and cumulative regret minimization algorithms for CBNs with general causal
graphs under atomic interventions and having unobserved confounders.</span>

                                        <span>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a nonparametric method for estimating the
shape of a density function, given a set of samples from the distribution.
Recently, locality-sensitive hashing, originally proposed as a tool for nearest
neighbor search, has been shown to enable fast KDE data structures. However,
these approaches do not take advantage of the many other advances that have
been made in algorithms for nearest neighbor algorithms. We present an
algorithm called Density Estimation from Approximate Nearest Neighbors (DEANN)
where we apply Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms as a black box
subroutine to compute an unbiased KDE. The idea is to find points that have a
large contribution to the KDE using ANN, compute their contribution exactly,
and approximate the remainder with Random Sampling (RS). We present a
theoretical argument that supports the idea that an ANN subroutine can speed up
the evaluation. Furthermore, we provide a C++ implementation with a Python
interface that can make use of an arbitrary ANN implementation as a subroutine
for KDE evaluation. We show empirically that our implementation outperforms
state of the art implementations in all high dimensional datasets we
considered, and matches the performance of RS in cases where the ANN yield no
gains in performance.</span>

reading-style (e.g., audiobook) speech, it is still challenging to synthesize
spontaneous-style speech (e.g., podcast or conversation), mainly because of two
reasons: 1) the lack of training data for spontaneous speech; 2) the difficulty
in modeling the filled pauses (um and uh) and diverse rhythms in spontaneous
speech. In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 3, an adaptive TTS system that
fine-tunes a well-trained reading-style TTS model for spontaneous-style speech.
Specifically, 1) to insert filled pauses (FP) in the text sequence
appropriately, we introduce an FP predictor to the TTS model; 2) to model the
varying rhythms, we introduce a duration predictor based on mixture of experts
(MoE), which contains three experts responsible for the generation of fast,
medium and slow speech respectively, and fine-tune it as well as the pitch
predictor for rhythm adaptation; 3) to adapt to other speaker timbre, we
fine-tune some parameters in the decoder with few speech data. To address the
challenge of lack of training data, we mine a spontaneous speech dataset to
support our research this work and facilitate future research on spontaneous
TTS. Experiments show that AdaSpeech 3 synthesizes speech with natural FP and
rhythms in spontaneous styles, and achieves much better MOS and SMOS scores
than previous adaptive TTS systems.</span>

                                        <span>Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest
in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on
faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been
traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters
that detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,
potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of
inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately
pruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an
increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between
different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression
of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its
direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow
for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective
sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark
architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their
absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more
appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we
develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with
effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random
pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or
better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et
al., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure
distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise
sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random
pruning.</span>

learning models using weather data. To answer this question, a real-world
public dataset is leveraged in this study and different drought levels are
predicted using the last 90 days of 18 meteorological indicators as the
predictors. In a comprehensive approach, 16 machine learning models and 16 deep
learning models are evaluated and compared. The results show no single model
can achieve the best performance for all evaluation metrics simultaneously,
which indicates the drought prediction problem is still challenging. As
benchmarks for further studies, the code and results are publicly available in
a Github repository.</span>

student-teacher neural networks, methods are developed for the analysis of
spurious minima in classes of gradient equivariant dynamics related to neural
nets. In the symmetric case, methods depend on the generic equivariant
bifurcation theory of irreducible representations of the symmetric group on $n$
symbols, $S_n$; in particular, the standard representation of $S_n$. It is
shown that spurious minima do not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking but
rather through a complex deformation of the landscape geometry that can be
encoded by a generic $S_n$-equivariant bifurcation. We describe minimal models
for forced symmetry breaking that give a lower bound on the dynamic complexity
involved in the creation of spurious minima when there is no symmetry. Results
on generic bifurcation when there are quadratic equivariants are also proved;
this work extends and clarifies results of Ihrig &amp; Golubitsky and Chossat,
Lauterback &amp; Melbourne on the instability of solutions when there are quadratic
equivariants.</span>

that affect clinical decision making, new strategies will need to be
incorporated in order to effectively detect and evaluate subgroup disparities
to ensure accountability and generalizability in clinical workflows. In this
paper, we explore how epistemic uncertainty can be used to evaluate disparity
in patient demographics (race) and data acquisition (scanner) subgroups for
breast density assessment on a dataset of 108,190 mammograms collected from 33
clinical sites. Our results show that even if aggregate performance is
comparable, the choice of uncertainty quantification metric can significantly
the subgroup level. We hope this analysis can promote further work on how
uncertainty can be leveraged to increase transparency of machine learning

problem in a non-stationary environment. To capture external changes, the
black-box function is allowed to be time-varying within a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS). To this end, we develop WGP-UCB, a novel UCB-type
algorithm based on weighted Gaussian process regression. A key challenge is how
to cope with infinite-dimensional feature maps. To that end, we leverage kernel
approximation techniques to prove a sublinear regret bound, which is the first
(frequentist) sublinear regret guarantee on weighted time-varying bandits with
general nonlinear rewards. This result generalizes both non-stationary linear
bandits and standard GP-UCB algorithms. Further, a novel concentration
inequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with general
weights. We also provide universal upper bounds and weight-dependent upper
bounds for weighted maximum information gains. These results are potentially of
independent interest for applications such as news ranking and adaptive
pricing, where weights can be adopted to capture the importance or quality of
data. Finally, we conduct experiments to highlight the favorable gains of the
proposed algorithm in many cases when compared to existing methods.</span>

enable the training of models on effectively larger datasets without data
transfer. Recent initiatives have demonstrated that segmentation models trained
with FL can achieve performance similar to locally trained models. However, FL
is not a fully privacy-preserving technique and privacy-centred attacks can
disclose confidential patient data. Thus, supplementing FL with
privacy-enhancing technologies (PTs) such as differential privacy (DP) is a
requirement for clinical applications in a multi-institutional setting. The
application of PTs to FL in medical imaging and the trade-offs between privacy
guarantees and model utility, the ramifications on training performance and the
susceptibility of the final models to attacks have not yet been conclusively
investigated. Here we demonstrate the first application of differentially
private gradient descent-based FL on the task of semantic segmentation in
computed tomography. We find that high segmentation performance is possible
under strong privacy guarantees with an acceptable training time penalty. We
furthermore demonstrate the first successful gradient-based model inversion
attack on a semantic segmentation model and show that the application of DP
prevents it from divulging sensitive image features.</span>

that matches a given text description. In practice, the captions annotated by
humans for the same image have large variance in terms of contents and the
choice of words. The linguistic discrepancy between the captions of the
identical image leads to the synthetic images deviating from the ground truth.
To address this issue, we propose a contrastive learning approach to improve
the quality and enhance the semantic consistency of synthetic images. In the
pre-training stage, we utilize the contrastive learning approach to learn the
consistent textual representations for the captions corresponding to the same
image. Furthermore, in the following stage of GAN training, we employ the
contrastive learning method to enhance the consistency between the generated
images from the captions related to the same image. We evaluate our approach
over two popular text-to-image synthesis models, AttnGAN and DM-GAN, on
datasets CUB and COCO, respectively. Experimental results have shown that our
approach can effectively improve the quality of synthetic images in terms of
three metrics: IS, FID and R-precision. Especially, on the challenging COCO
dataset, our approach boosts the FID significantly by 29.60% over AttnGAn and
by 21.96% over DM-GAN.</span>

                                        <span>Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently,
whose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph.
Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily
depend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain
in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it
needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To
approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution
for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level
Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation
of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce
a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original
graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error,
while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order
proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a
complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant
representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to
preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data
simultaneously. Extensive experiments indicate MLGCL achieves promising results
compared with the existing state-of-the-art graph representation learning
methods on seven datasets.</span>

tasks to prepare for and learn faster in new, unseen, but related tasks. The
training tasks are usually hand-crafted to be representative of the expected
distribution of test tasks and hence all used in training. We show that given a
set of training tasks, learning can be both faster and more effective (leading
to better performance in the test tasks), if the training tasks are
appropriately selected. We propose a task selection algorithm,
Information-Theoretic Task Selection (ITTS), based on information theory, which
optimizes the set of tasks used for training in meta-RL, irrespectively of how
they are generated. The algorithm establishes which training tasks are both
sufficiently relevant for the test tasks, and different enough from one
another. We reproduce different meta-RL experiments from the literature and

incorrect diagnosis, leaving an unmet need for innovative supporting
technologies. We have developed the first ever end-to-end deep learning-based
technology for automated bone marrow cytology. Starting with a bone marrow
aspirate digital whole slide image, our technology rapidly and automatically
detects suitable regions for cytology, and subsequently identifies and
classifies all bone marrow cells in each region. This collective
cytomorphological information is captured in a novel representation called
Histogram of Cell Types (HCT) quantifying bone marrow cell class probability
distribution and acting as a cytological &quot;patient fingerprint&quot;. The approach
achieves high accuracy in region detection (0.97 accuracy and 0.99 ROC AUC),
and cell detection and cell classification (0.75 mAP, 0.78 F1-score,
Log-average miss rate of 0.31). HCT has potential to revolutionize
hematopathology diagnostic workflows, leading to more cost-effective, accurate
diagnosis and opening the door to precision medicine.</span>

but also they are one of the most vulnerable areas with high populations who
would together experience the negative impacts. In this paper, I address some
of the opportunities brought by satellite remote sensing imaging and artificial
intelligence (AI) in order to measure climate adaptation of cities
automatically. I propose an AI-based framework which might be useful for
extracting indicators from remote sensing images and might help with predictive
estimation of future states of these climate adaptation related indicators.
When such models become more robust and used in real-life applications, they
might help decision makers and early responders to choose the best actions to
sustain the wellbeing of society, natural resources and biodiversity. I
underline that this is an open field and an ongoing research for many
scientists, therefore I offer an in depth discussion on the challenges and
limitations of AI-based methods and the predictive estimation models in
general.</span>

reference annotations are difficult to collect and vary significantly even

unbiased errors artificially introduced to brain tumour annotations on MRI

robust or fairly robust to unbiased errors but sensitive to biased errors. It
is therefore important to identify the sorts of errors expected in medical

elliptical slice sampler, introduced by Murray, Adams and MacKay 2010, provides
a tool for the construction of a Markov chain for approximate sampling of the
underlying posterior distribution. Besides of its wide applicability and
simplicity its main feature is that no tuning is necessary. Under weak
regularity assumptions on the posterior density we show that the corresponding
Markov chain is geometrically ergodic and therefore yield qualitative
convergence guarantees. We illustrate our result for Gaussian posteriors as
they appear in Gaussian process regression, as well as in a setting of a
multi-modal distribution. Remarkably, our numerical experiments indicate a
dimension-independent performance of elliptical slice sampling even in
situations where our ergodicity result does not apply.</span>

detection of fetal malformations which have potential long-term health impacts.
The level of skill required to diagnose such malformations from live ultrasound
during examination is high and resources for screening are often limited. We
present an interpretable, atlas-learning segmentation method for automatic
diagnosis of Hypo-plastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) from a single &#x60;4 Chamber

Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks (Atlas-ISTN) into a framework that
enables sensitising atlas generation to disease. In this framework we can
jointly learn image segmentation, registration, atlas construction and disease
prediction while providing a maximum level of clinical interpretability
compared to direct image classification methods. As a result our segmentation
allows diagnoses competitive with expert-derived manual diagnosis and yields an
AUC-ROC of 0.978 (1043 cases for training, 260 for validation and 325 for

                                        <span>Prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a challenging
task. In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to
automate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although
the performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still
room for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in
clinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image
segmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the
background pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a
DL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images
to produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and
the background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of
DL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard
center-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate
segmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net.
The proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms
of segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks.
In terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and
ResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.</span>

playing far different roles in structure and function and edges representing
the relationships between nodes. Identifying critical nodes can help us control
the spread of public opinions or epidemics, predict leading figures in
academia, conduct advertisements for various commodities, and so on. However,
it is rather difficult to identify critical nodes because the network structure
changes over time in temporal networks. In this paper, considering the sequence
topological information of temporal networks, a novel and effective learning
framework based on the combination of special GCNs and RNNs is proposed to
identify nodes with the best spreading ability. The effectiveness of the
approach is evaluated by weighted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.
Experimental results on four real-world temporal networks demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning benchmark
methods in terms of the Kendall $\tau$ coefficient and top $k$ hit rate.</span>

high-dimensional PDEs, seemingly escaping the curse of dimensionality. However,
questions regarding the theoretical basis for such approximations, including
the required network size, remain open. In this paper, we investigate the
representational power of neural networks for approximating solutions to linear
elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove that when a PDE&#x27;s
coefficients are representable by small neural networks, the parameters
required to approximate its solution scale polynomially with the input
dimension $d$ and proportionally to the parameter counts of the coefficient
networks. To this we end, we develop a proof technique that simulates gradient
descent (in an appropriate Hilbert space) by growing a neural network
architecture whose iterates each participate as sub-networks in their (slightly
larger) successors, and converge to the solution of the PDE. We bound the size
of the solution, showing a polynomial dependence on $d$ and no dependence on
the volume of the domain.</span>

                                        <span>Meta learning has attracted much attention recently in machine learning
community. Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent
prediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to
learn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as
to generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning
methodology. In this study, we interpret such learning methodology as learning
an explicit hyperparameter prediction policy shared by all training tasks.
Specifically, this policy is represented as a parameterized function called
meta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyperparameter
setting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning
machine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is
able to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed
hyperparameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability
to query task&#x27;s variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it
easily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its
generalization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally
leads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of
the extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its
generalization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including

                                        <span>Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have
delivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and
discovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the
prior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet
distribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same
layer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose
sawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of
documents that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the
topics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are
represented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a
layer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic
embedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of
the layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares
components between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as
sawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is
constructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.
Experiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic
models on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document
representations.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, the deep learning community has largely focused on the
accuracy of deep generative models, resulting in impressive improvements in
several research fields. However, this scientific race for quality comes at a
tremendous computational cost, which incurs vast energy consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions. If the current exponential growth of computational
consumption persists, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will sadly become a
considerable contributor to global warming.

At the heart of this problem are the measures that we use as a scientific
community to evaluate our work. Currently, researchers in the field of AI judge
scientific works mostly based on the improvement in accuracy, log-likelihood,
reconstruction or opinion scores, all of which entirely obliterates the actual
computational cost of generative models.

In this paper, we introduce the idea of relying on a multi-objective measure
based on Pareto optimality, which simultaneously integrates the models
accuracy, as well as the environmental impact of their training. By applying
this measure on the current state-of-the-art in generative audio models, we
show that this measure drastically changes the perceived significance of the
results in the field, encouraging optimal training techniques and resource
allocation. We hope that this type of measure will be widely adopted, in order
to help the community to better evaluate the significance of their work, while
bringing computational cost -- and in fine carbon emissions -- in the spotlight
of AI research.</span>

                                        <span>Softmax is widely used in deep learning to map some representation to a
probability distribution. As it is based on exp/log functions that are
relatively expensive in multi-party computation, Mohassel and Zhang (2017)
proposed a simpler replacement based on ReLU to be used in secure computation.
However, we could not reproduce the accuracy they reported for training on
MNIST with three fully connected layers. Later works (e.g., Wagh et al., 2019
and 2021) used the softmax replacement not for computing the output probability
distribution but for approximating the gradient in back-propagation. In this
work, we analyze the two uses of the replacement and compare them to softmax,
both in terms of accuracy and cost in multi-party computation. We found that
the replacement only provides a significant speed-up for a one-layer network
while it always reduces accuracy, sometimes significantly. Thus we conclude
that its usefulness is limited and one should use the original softmax function
instead.</span>

                                        <span>With the widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), machine learning
algorithms have evolved in two diverse directions -- one with ever-increasing
connection density for better accuracy and the other with more compact sizing
for energy efficiency. The increase in connection density increases on-chip
data movement, which makes efficient on-chip communication a critical function
of the DNN accelerator. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we
illustrate that the point-to-point (P2P)-based interconnect is incapable of
handling a high volume of on-chip data movement for DNNs. Second, we evaluate
P2P and network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect (with a regular topology such as a
mesh) for SRAM- and ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures for a
range of DNNs. This analysis shows the necessity for the optimal interconnect
choice for an IMC DNN accelerator. Finally, we perform an experimental
evaluation for different DNNs to empirically obtain the performance of the IMC
architecture with both NoC-tree and NoC-mesh. We conclude that, at the tile
level, NoC-tree is appropriate for compact DNNs employed at the edge, and
NoC-mesh is necessary to accelerate DNNs with high connection density.
Furthermore, we propose a technique to determine the optimal choice of
interconnect for any given DNN. In this technique, we use analytical models of
NoC to evaluate end-to-end communication latency of any given DNN. We
demonstrate that the interconnect optimization in the IMC architecture results
in up to 6$\times$ improvement in energy-delay-area product for VGG-19
inference compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based IMC architectures.</span>

static random-access memory (SRAM) macro, named CAP-RAM, is presented for
energy-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. It leverages a
novel charge-domain multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) mechanism and circuitry to
achieve superior linearity under process variations compared to conventional
IMC designs. The adopted semi-parallel architecture efficiently stores filters
from multiple CNN layers by sharing eight standard 6T SRAM cells with one
charge-domain MAC circuit. Moreover, up to six levels of bit-width of weights
with two encoding schemes and eight levels of input activations are supported.
A 7-bit charge-injection SAR (ciSAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) getting
rid of sample and hold (S&amp;H) and input/reference buffers further improves the
overall energy efficiency and throughput. A 65-nm prototype validates the
excellent linearity and computing accuracy of CAP-RAM. A single 512x128 macro
stores a complete pruned and quantized CNN model to achieve 98.8% inference
accuracy on the MNIST data set and 89.0% on the CIFAR-10 data set, with a

has changed the climate and we are currently heading into a climate crisis.
While public discussion and research efforts on climate change mitigation have
increased, potential solutions need to not only be discussed but also
effectively deployed. For preventing mismanagement and holding policy makers
accountable, transparency and degree of information about government processes
have been shown to be crucial. However, currently the quantity of information
about climate change discussions and the range of sources make it increasingly
difficult for the public and civil society to maintain an overview to hold
politicians accountable.

In response, we propose a multi-source topic aggregation system (MuSTAS)

                                        <span>Recent advances in deep representation learning on Riemannian manifolds
extend classical deep learning operations to better capture the geometry of the
manifold. One possible extension is the Fr\&#x27;echet mean, the generalization of
the Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a
closed form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to
differentiate through the Fr\&#x27;echet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds.
Then, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and
a fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free Fr\&#x27;echet mean solver. This fully
integrates the Fr\&#x27;echet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To
demonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our
Fr\&#x27;echet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network,
replacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on
datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the Fr\&#x27;echet mean&#x27;s
capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a
hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the
one observed in the Euclidean setting.</span>

predictive control (MPC) law with guarantees on recursive feasibility and
asymptotic stability. The approach combines an offline-trained fully-connected
neural network with an online primal active set solver. The neural network
provides a control input initialization while the primal active set method
ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The neural network is
trained with a primal-dual loss function, aiming to generate control sequences
that are primal feasible and meet a desired level of suboptimality. Since the
neural network alone does not guarantee constraint satisfaction, its output is
used to warm start the primal active set method online. We demonstrate that
this approach scales to large problems with thousands of optimization
variables, which are challenging for current approaches. Our method achieves a
2x reduction in online inference time compared to the best method in a
benchmark suite of different solver and initialization strategies.</span>

                                        <span>Recently a novel framework has been proposed for designing the molecular
structure of chemical compounds using both artificial neural networks (ANNs)
and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In the framework, we first define
a feature vector $f(C)$ of a chemical graph $C$ and construct an ANN that maps
$x&#x3D;f(C)$ to a predicted value $\eta(x)$ of a chemical property $\pi$ to $C$.
After this, we formulate an MILP that simulates the computation process of
$f(C)$ from $C$ and that of $\eta(x)$ from $x$. Given a target value $y^*$ of
the chemical property $\pi$, we infer a chemical graph $C^\dagger$ such that
$\eta(f(C^\dagger))&#x3D;y^*$ by solving the MILP. In this paper, we use linear
regression to construct a prediction function $\eta$ instead of ANNs. For this,
we derive an MILP formulation that simulates the computation process of a
prediction function by linear regression. The results of computational
experiments suggest our method can infer chemical graphs with around up to 50
non-hydrogen atoms.</span>

preserving high-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate
positions as an array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the
effectiveness of these positional encodings has been solely studied through a
Fourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing
that alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for
positional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely
determined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and
the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish
that the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case
that fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory
to analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. To this
end, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that
our theoretical claims hold in practice. Codes available at

                                        <span>Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.
However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3$\times$ as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\times$224
ImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images. The
models and source code will be released soon.</span>

labeled training data, is only as good as the quality of that data. This study
builds on prior work that investigated to what extent &#x27;best practices&#x27; around
labeling training data were followed in applied ML publications within a single
domain (social media platforms). In this paper, we expand by studying
publications that apply supervised ML in a far broader spectrum of disciplines,
focusing on human-labeled data. We report to what extent a random sample of ML
application papers across disciplines give specific details about whether best
practices were followed, while acknowledging that a greater range of
application fields necessarily produces greater diversity of labeling and
annotation methods. Because much of machine learning research and education
only focuses on what is done once a &quot;ground truth&quot; or &quot;gold standard&quot; of
training data is available, it is especially relevant to discuss issues around
the equally-important aspect of whether such data is reliable in the first
place. This determination becomes increasingly complex when applied to a
variety of specialized fields, as labeling can range from a task requiring
little-to-no background knowledge to one that must be performed by someone with
career expertise.</span>

systems that combine multiple sensory modalities. On the other hand,
state-of-the-art artificial agents rely mostly on visual inputs or structured
low-dimensional observations provided by instrumented environments. Learning to
act based on combined visual and auditory inputs is still a new topic of
research that has not been explored beyond simple scenarios. To facilitate
progress in this area we introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create
a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations.
We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks
that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in
natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and
find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary. We
are currently in the process of merging the augmented simulator with the main
ViZDoom code repository. Video demonstrations and experiment code can be found

                                        <span>We address the problem of solving complex bimanual robot manipulation tasks
on multiple objects with sparse rewards. Such complex tasks can be decomposed
into sub-tasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or
sequentially for better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning
approaches primarily focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two
fundamental issues are largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative
strategies for two robots: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a
task by itself and leaves the other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can
easily interrupt another&#x27;s workspace when executing different sub-tasks
simultaneously. To tackle these two issues, we propose a novel technique called
disentangled attention, which provides an intrinsic regularization for two
robots to focus on separate sub-tasks and objects. We evaluate our method on
four bimanual manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed
intrinsic regularization successfully avoids domination and reduces conflicts
for the policies, which leads to significantly more effective cooperative
strategies than all the baselines. Our project page with videos is at

that connected nodes tend to be similar with respect to a specific attribute.
As such, ubiquitous datasets for graph machine learning tasks have generally
been highly homophilous, rewarding methods that leverage homophily as an
inductive bias. Recent work has pointed out this particular focus, as new
non-homophilous datasets have been introduced and graph representation learning
models better suited for low-homophily settings have been developed. However,
these datasets are small and poorly suited to truly testing the effectiveness
of new methods in non-homophilous settings. We present a series of improved
graph datasets with node label relationships that do not satisfy the homophily
principle. Along with this, we introduce a new measure of the presence or
absence of homophily that is better suited than existing measures in different
regimes. We benchmark a range of simple methods and graph neural networks
across our proposed datasets, drawing new insights for further research. Data

case of a new family of unsupervised learning methods, the self-supervised
variational autoencoder (SSVAE). SSVAEs circumvent the usual VAE requirement to
reconstruct the data by using a carefully chosen implicit decoder. The InfoNCE
objective was motivated as a simplified parametric mutual information
estimator. Under one choice of prior, the SSVAE objective (i.e. the ELBO) is
exactly equal to the mutual information (up to constants). Under an alternative
choice of prior, the SSVAE objective is exactly equal to the simplified
parametric mutual information estimator used in InfoNCE (up to constants).
Importantly, the use of simplified parametric mutual information estimators is
believed to be critical to obtain good high-level representations, and the
SSVAE framework naturally provides a principled justification for using prior
information to choose these estimators.</span>

rows under the plant canopy and accomplish tasks that are infeasible for
over-the-canopy drones or larger agricultural equipment. However, autonomously
navigating them under the canopy presents a number of challenges: unreliable
GPS and LiDAR, high cost of sensing, challenging farm terrain, clutter due to
leaves and weeds, and large variability in appearance over the season and
across crop types. We address these challenges by building a modular system
that leverages machine learning for robust and generalizable perception from
monocular RGB images from low-cost cameras, and model predictive control for
accurate control in challenging terrain. Our system, CropFollow, is able to
autonomously drive 485 meters per intervention on average, outperforming a

vision tasks. We modify the ViT architecture to work on longer sequence data by
replacing the quadratic attention with efficient transformers like Performer,
Linformer and Nystr\&quot;omformer of linear complexity creating Vision X-formers
(ViX). We show that ViX performs better than ViT in image classification
consuming lesser computing resources. We further show that replacing the
embedding linear layer by convolutional layers in ViX further increases their
performance. Our test on recent visions transformer models like LeViT and
Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) show that replacing the attention with
Nystr\&quot;omformer or Performer saves GPU usage and memory without deteriorating
performance. Incorporating these changes can democratize transformers by making

                                        <span>Online hate speech is a recent problem in our society that is rising at a
steady pace by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the corresponding regimes that
characterise most social media platforms. This phenomenon is primarily fostered
by offensive comments, either during user interaction or in the form of a
posted multimedia context. Nowadays, giant corporations own platforms where
millions of users log in every day, and protection from exposure to similar
phenomena appears to be necessary in order to comply with the corresponding
legislation and maintain a high level of service quality. A robust and reliable
system for detecting and preventing the uploading of relevant content will have
a significant impact on our digitally interconnected society. Several aspects
of our daily lives are undeniably linked to our social profiles, making us
vulnerable to abusive behaviours. As a result, the lack of accurate hate speech
detection mechanisms would severely degrade the overall user experience,
although its erroneous operation would pose many ethical concerns. In this
paper, we present &#x27;ETHOS&#x27;, a textual dataset with two variants: binary and
multi-label, based on YouTube and Reddit comments validated using the
Figure-Eight crowdsourcing platform. Furthermore, we present the annotation
protocol used to create this dataset: an active sampling procedure for
balancing our data in relation to the various aspects defined. Our key
assumption is that, even gaining a small amount of labelled data from such a
time-consuming process, we can guarantee hate speech occurrences in the
examined material.</span>

                                        <span>We take a geometrical viewpoint and present a unifying view on supervised
deep learning with the Bregman divergence loss function - this entails frequent
classification and prediction tasks. Motivated by simulations we suggest that
there is principally no implicit bias of vanilla stochastic gradient descent
training of deep models towards &quot;simpler&quot; functions. Instead, we show that good
generalization may be instigated by bounded spectral products over layers
leading to a novel geometric regularizer. It is revealed that in deep enough
models such a regularizer enables both, extreme accuracy and generalization, to
be reached. We associate popular regularization techniques like weight decay,
drop out, batch normalization, and early stopping with this perspective. Backed
up by theory we further demonstrate that &quot;generalization by design&quot; is
practically possible and that good generalization may be encoded into the
structure of the network. We design two such easy-to-use structural
regularizers that insert an additional \textit{generalization layer} into a
model architecture, one with a skip connection and another one with drop-out.
We verify our theoretical results in experiments on various feedforward and
convolutional architectures, including ResNets, and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10,
synthetic data). We believe this work opens up new avenues of research towards
better generalizing architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Attack graphs (AG) are used to assess pathways availed by cyber adversaries
to penetrate a network. State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus
mostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network
scans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and
ineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs.
We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through
intrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an
unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and
probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic
deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) -- a model that accentuates infrequent
severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from
the S-PDFA. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate
Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE produces AGs that reflect the strategies
used by participating teams. The resulting AGs are succinct, interpretable, and
enable analysts to derive actionable insights, e.g., attackers tend to follow
shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one.</span>

this work, we present a new General Purpose (GenP) ensemble that boosts
performance by combining local features, dense sampling features, and deep
learning approaches. First, we introduce three new methods for data
augmentation based on PCA/DCT; second, we show that different data augmentation
approaches can boost the performance of an ensemble of CNNs; and, finally, we
propose a set of handcrafted/learned descriptors that are highly generalizable.
Each handcrafted descriptor is used to train a different Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and the different SVMs are combined with the ensemble of CNNs. Our
method is evaluated on a diverse set of bioimage classification problems.
Results demonstrate that the proposed GenP bioimage ensemble obtains
state-of-the-art performance without any ad-hoc dataset tuning of parameters
(thus avoiding the risk of overfitting/overtraining).</span>

which the learner observes noisy comparisons of disjoint pairs of $k$-sized
teams from a universe of $n$ players. The goal of the learner is to minimize
the number of duels required to identify, with high probability, a Condorcet
winning team, i.e., a team which wins against any other disjoint team (with
probability at least $1/2$). Noisy comparisons are linked to a total order on
the teams. We formalize our model by building upon the dueling bandits setting
(Yue et al.2012) and provide several algorithms, both for stochastic and
deterministic settings. For the stochastic setting, we provide a reduction to
the classical dueling bandits setting, yielding an algorithm that identifies a
Condorcet winning team within $\mathcal{O}((n + k \log (k)) \frac{\max(\log\log
n, \log k)}{\Delta^2})$ duels, where $\Delta$ is a gap parameter. For

the intuitive and associative (&quot;System 1&quot;) and the deliberative and logical
(&quot;System 2&quot;). Neural sequence models -- which have been increasingly successful
at performing complex, structured tasks -- exhibit the advantages and failure
modes of System 1: they are fast and learn patterns from data, but are often
inconsistent and incoherent. In this work, we seek a lightweight, training-free
means of improving existing System 1-like sequence models by adding System
2-inspired logical reasoning. We explore several variations on this theme in
which candidate generations from a neural sequence model are examined for
logical consistency by a symbolic reasoning module, which can either accept or
reject the generations. Our approach uses neural inference to mediate between
the neural System 1 and the logical System 2. Results in robust story
generation and grounded instruction-following show that this approach can
increase the coherence and accuracy of neurally-based generations.</span>

(DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale
datasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs,
impeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be
alleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean
samples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble
Noise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select
clean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second
problem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an
uncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels
for each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight
given to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and
extensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are
provided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification
tasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise
ratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used,
Clothing-1M and WebVision. E-NKCVS is empirically shown to be highly tolerant
to considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement
over state-of-the-art methods. Especially on more difficult datasets with
higher noise ratios, we can achieve a significant improvement over the
second-best model. Moreover, our proposed approach can easily be integrated
into existing DNN methods to improve their robustness against label noise.</span>

DCASE 2021 Challenge Task 4. The proposed SED model consists of two stages: a
mean-teacher model for providing target labels regarding weakly labeled or
unlabeled data and a self-training-based noisy student model for predicting
strong labels for sound events. The mean-teacher model, which is based on the
residual convolutional recurrent neural network (RCRNN) for the teacher and
student model, is first trained using all the training data from a weakly
labeled dataset, an unlabeled dataset, and a strongly labeled synthetic
dataset. Then, the trained mean-teacher model predicts the strong label to each
of the weakly labeled and unlabeled datasets, which is brought to the noisy
student model in the second stage of the proposed SED model. Here, the
structure of the noisy student model is identical to the RCRNN-based student
model of the mean-teacher model in the first stage. Then, it is self-trained by
adding feature noises, such as time-frequency shift, mixup, SpecAugment, and
dropout-based model noise. In addition, a semi-supervised loss function is
applied to train the noisy student model, which acts as label noise injection.
The performance of the proposed SED model is evaluated on the validation set of
the DCASE 2021 Challenge Task 4, and then, several ensemble models that combine
five-fold validation models with different hyperparameters of the
semi-supervised loss function are finally selected as our final models.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to support domain-specific
Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) for the real-world use-case scenarios
of smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). We
argue that the majority of available data in the nature for Artificial
Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) are unlabeled. Hence,
unsupervised and/or semi-supervised ML approaches are the practical choices.
However, prior work in the literature of MDSE has considered supervised ML
approaches, which only work with labeled training data. Our proposed approach
is fully implemented and integrated with an existing state-of-the-art MDSE tool
to serve the CPS/IoT domain. Moreover, we validate the proposed approach using
a portion of the open data of the REFIT reference dataset for the smart energy
systems domain. Our model-to-code transformations (code generators) provide the
full source code of the desired IoT services out of the model instances in an
automated manner. Currently, we generate the source code in Java and Python.
The Python code is responsible for the ML functionalities and uses the APIs of
several ML libraries and frameworks, namely Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.
For unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, the APIs of Scikit-Learn are
deployed. In addition to the pure MDSE approach, where certain ML methods,
e.g., K-Means, Mini-Batch K-Means, DB-SCAN, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian
Mixture Model, Self-Training, Label Propagation and Label Spreading are
supported, a more flexible, hybrid approach is also enabled to support the
practitioner in deploying a pre-trained ML model with any arbitrary
architecture and learning algorithm.</span>

universal approximation property for all continuous functions with a fixed
finite number of neurons. These neural networks are simple because they are
designed with a simple and computable continuous activation function $\sigma$
leveraging a triangular-wave function and a softsign function. We prove that
$\sigma$-activated networks with width $36d(2d+1)$ and depth $11$ can
approximate any continuous function on a $d$-dimensioanl hypercube within an
arbitrarily small error. Hence, for supervised learning and its related
regression problems, the hypothesis space generated by these networks with a
size not smaller than $36d(2d+1)\times 11$ is dense in the space of continuous
functions. Furthermore, classification functions arising from image and signal
classification are in the hypothesis space generated by $\sigma$-activated
networks with width $36d(2d+1)$ and depth $12$, when there exist pairwise
disjoint closed bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the samples of the
same class are located in the same subset.</span>

part of an observation is available. We rely on the following fact: if the
flow&#x27;s domain can be partitioned in such a way that the flow restrictions to
subdomains keep the bijectivity property, a lower bound to the conditioning
variable log-probability can be derived. Simulation from the variational
conditional flow then amends to solving an equality constraint. Our
contribution is three-fold: a) we provide detailed insights on the choice of
variational distributions; b) we propose how to partition the input space of
the flow to preserve bijectivity property; c) we propose a set of methods to
optimise the variational distribution in specific cases. Through extensive

invertible residual networks for inference and classification.</span>

                                        <span>Active learning promises to alleviate the massive data needs of supervised
machine learning: it has successfully improved sample efficiency by an order of
magnitude on traditional tasks like topic classification and object
recognition. However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5
models and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety
of active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To
understand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a
per-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of
examples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to
learn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external
knowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative
visualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon
responsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that
active learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of
collective outliers in the active learning pool decreases. We conclude with a
discussion and prescriptive recommendations for mitigating the effects of these
outliers in future work.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning has advanced from fully connected architectures to structured
models organized into components, e.g., the transformer composed of positional
elements, modular architectures divided into slots, and graph neural nets made
up of nodes. In structured models, an interesting question is how to conduct
dynamic and possibly sparse communication among the separate components. Here,
we explore the hypothesis that restricting the transmitted information among
components to discrete representations is a beneficial bottleneck. The
motivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through
discrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what
a &#x60;&#x60;&quot;cat&quot; is based on their specific experiences, the shared discrete token
makes it possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by
individual differences in internal representation. To discretize the values of
concepts dynamically communicated among specialist components, we extend the
quantization mechanism from the Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder to
multi-headed discretization with shared codebooks and use it for
discrete-valued neural communication (DVNC). Our experiments show that DVNC
substantially improves systematic generalization in a variety of architectures
-- transformers, modular architectures, and graph neural networks. We also show
that the DVNC is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, making the method
very useful in practice. Moreover, we establish a theoretical justification of
our discretization process, proving that it has the ability to increase noise
robustness and reduce the underlying dimensionality of the model.</span>

                                        <span>One common failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models is fitting
incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. We
propose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning
neural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth
supervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to
regularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering
novel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require
images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running
structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that
can be used as &#x60;&#x60;free&quot; depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss
to ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is
close to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate
images given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two
training views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as
well as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with
these NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible
supervisory signal. Finally, we show that DS-NeRF supports other types of depth
supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGBD reconstruction outputs.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Many defenses based on
randomized neural networks have been proposed to solve the problem, but fail to
achieve robustness against attacks using proxy gradients such as the
Expectation over Transformation (EOT) attack. We investigate the effect of the
adversarial attacks using proxy gradients on randomized neural networks and
demonstrate that it highly relies on the directional distribution of the loss
gradients of the randomized neural network. We show in particular that proxy
gradients are less effective when the gradients are more scattered. To this
end, we propose Gradient Diversity (GradDiv) regularizations that minimize the
concentration of the gradients to build a robust randomized neural network. Our
experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and STL10 show that our proposed GradDiv
regularizations improve the adversarial robustness of randomized neural
networks against a variety of state-of-the-art attack methods. Moreover, our

                                        <span>Academic advances of AI models in high-precision domains, like healthcare,
need to be made explainable in order to enhance real-world adoption. Our past
studies and ongoing interactions indicate that medical experts can use AI
systems with greater trust if there are ways to connect the model inferences
about patients to explanations that are tied back to the context of use.
Specifically, risk prediction is a complex problem of diagnostic and
interventional importance to clinicians wherein they consult different sources
to make decisions. To enable the adoption of the ever improving AI risk
prediction models in practice, we have begun to explore techniques to
contextualize such models along three dimensions of interest: the patients&#x27;
clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and
algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We validate the importance
of these dimensions by implementing a proof-of-concept (POC) in type-2 diabetes
(T2DM) use case where we assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a
common T2DM comorbidity. Within the POC, we include risk prediction models for
CKD, post-hoc explainers of the predictions, and other natural-language modules
which operationalize domain knowledge and CPGs to provide context. With primary
care physicians (PCP) as our end-users, we present our initial results and
clinician feedback in this paper. Our POC approach covers multiple knowledge
sources and clinical scenarios, blends knowledge to explain data and
predictions to PCPs, and received an enthusiastic response from our medical
expert.</span>

of new applications like internet of things, autonomous driving systems, and
drone are crowding the unlicensed spectrum. Licensed network such as the
long-term evolution (LTE) also comes to the unlicensed spectrum for better
providing high-capacity contents with low cost. However, LTE was not designed
to share resources with others. Previous solutions usually work on fixed
scenarios. This work features a Nonparametric Bayesian reinforcement learning
algorithm to cope with the coexistence between Wi-Fi and LTE licensed assisted
access (LTE-LAA) agents in 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum. The coexistence problem
is modeled as a decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process
(Dec-POMDP) and Bayesian inference is adopted for policy learning with
nonparametric prior to accommodate the uncertainty of policy for different
agents. A fairness measure is introduced in the reward function to encourage
fair sharing between agents. Variational inference for posterior model
approximation is considered to make the algorithm computationally efficient.
Simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm can reach high value with
compact policy representations in few learning iterations.</span>

multiple, possibly unreliable, sensors. We find that current methods do not
sufficiently encourage a shared representation between modalities; this can
cause poor performance on downstream tasks and over-reliance on specific
sensors. As a solution, we contribute a new multi-modal deep latent state-space
model, trained using a mutual information lower-bound. The key innovation is a
specially-designed density ratio estimator that encourages consistency between
the latent codes of each modality. We tasked our method to learn policies (in a
self-supervised manner) on multi-modal Natural MuJoCo benchmarks and a
challenging Table Wiping task. Experiments show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, particularly
in the presence of missing observations.</span>

                                        <span>When a robot performs a task next to a human, physical interaction is
inevitable: the human might push, pull, twist, or guide the robot. The
state-of-the-art treats these interactions as disturbances that the robot
should reject or avoid. At best, these robots respond safely while the human
interacts; but after the human lets go, these robots simply return to their
original behavior. We recognize that physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is
often intentional -- the human intervenes on purpose because the robot is not
doing the task correctly. In this paper, we argue that when pHRI is intentional
it is also informative: the robot can leverage interactions to learn how it
should complete the rest of its current task even after the person lets go. We
formalize pHRI as a dynamical system, where the human has in mind an objective
function they want the robot to optimize, but the robot does not get direct
access to the parameters of this objective -- they are internal to the human.
Within our proposed framework human interactions become observations about the
true objective. We introduce approximations to learn from and respond to pHRI
in real-time. We recognize that not all human corrections are perfect: often
users interact with the robot noisily, and so we improve the efficiency of
robot learning from pHRI by reducing unintended learning. Finally, we conduct
simulations and user studies on a robotic manipulator to compare our proposed
approach to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that learning from pHRI
leads to better task performance and improved human satisfaction.</span>

                                        <span>Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made
tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary
environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines
how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data
in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as
deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current
multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can
detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to
their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in
this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks&#x27; learning dynamics,
emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose
Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the
concept of Continual Learning (CoL), Representation Learning (ReL), and
Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain
adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets,
while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student
model setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
is efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and
GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art
baseline methods.</span>

complexity measures in bandit and reinforcement learning. Eluder dimension was
originally proposed as a general complexity measure of function classes, but
the common examples of where it is known to be small are function spaces
(vector spaces). In these cases, the primary tool to upper bound the eluder
dimension is the elliptic potential lemma. Interestingly, the elliptic
potential lemma also features prominently in the analysis of linear
bandits/reinforcement learning and their nonparametric generalization, the
information gain. We show that this is not a coincidence -- eluder dimension
and information gain are equivalent in a precise sense for reproducing kernel

                                        <span>Drug combination therapy has become a increasingly promising method in the
treatment of cancer. However, the number of possible drug combinations is so
huge that it is hard to screen synergistic drug combinations through wet-lab
experiments. Therefore, computational screening has become an important way to
prioritize drug combinations. Graph neural network have recently shown
remarkable performance in the prediction of compound-protein interactions, but
it has not been applied to the screening of drug combinations. In this paper,
we proposed a deep learning model based on graph neural networks and attention
mechanism to identify drug combinations that can effectively inhibit the
viability of specific cancer cells. The feature embeddings of drug molecule
structure and gene expression profiles were taken as input to multi-layer
feedforward neural network to identify the synergistic drug combinations. We
compared DeepDDS with classical machine learning methods and other deep
learning-based methods on benchmark data set, and the leave-one-out
experimental results showed that DeepDDS achieved better performance than
competitive methods. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known
pharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive
methods by more than 16\% predictive precision. Furthermore, we explored the
interpretability of the graph attention network, and found the correlation
matrix of atomic features revealed important chemical substructures of drugs.
We believed that DeepDDS is an effective tool that prioritized synergistic drug
combinations for further wet-lab experiment validation.</span>

automatic speech recognition (ASR). When using appropriate modeling units,
e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open
vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words
not seen during training, e.g., named entities, numbers or technical terms. To
alleviate this problem we supplement an end-to-end ASR system with a
word/phrase memory and a mechanism to access this memory to recognize the words
and phrases correctly. After the training of the ASR system, and when it has
already been deployed, a relevant word can be added or subtracted instantly
without the need for further training. In this paper we demonstrate that
through this mechanism our system is able to recognize more than 85% of newly
added words that it previously failed to recognize compared to a strong
baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Human body volume estimation from a single RGB image is a challenging problem
despite minimal attention from the research community. However VolNet, an
architecture leveraging 2D and 3D pose estimation, body part segmentation and
volume regression extracted from a single 2D RGB image combined with the
subject&#x27;s body height can be used to estimate the total body volume. VolNet is
designed to predict the 2D and 3D pose as well as the body part segmentation in
intermediate tasks. We generated a synthetic, large-scale dataset of
photo-realistic images of human bodies with a wide range of body shapes and
realistic poses called SURREALvols. By using Volnet and combining multiple
stacked hourglass networks together with ResNeXt, our model correctly predicted
the volume in ~82% of cases with a 10% tolerance threshold. This is a
considerable improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions such as BodyNet
with only a ~38% success rate.</span>

clinical diagnoses, model generalizability is of the utmost importance as
clinical decision-making must be domain-agnostic. A method of tackling the
problem is to increase the dataset to include images from a multitude of
domains; while this technique is ideal, the security requirements of medical
data is a major limitation. Additionally, researchers with developed tools
benefit from the addition of open-sourced data, but are limited by the
difference in domains. Herewith, we investigated the implementation of a
Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for the domain
adaptation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes. This study was done
in collaboration with the Biomedical Optics Research Group and Functional &amp;
Anatomical Imaging &amp; Shape Analysis Lab at Simon Fraser University. In this
study, we investigated a learning-based approach of adapting the domain of a
publicly available dataset, UK Biobank dataset (UKB). To evaluate the
performance of domain adaptation, we utilized pre-existing retinal layer
segmentation tools developed on a different set of RETOUCH OCT data. This study
provides insight on state-of-the-art tools for domain adaptation compared to
traditional processing techniques as well as a pipeline for adapting publicly
available retinal data to the domains previously used by our collaborators.</span>

                                        <span>A recurring theme in statistical learning, online learning, and beyond is
that faster convergence rates are possible for problems with low noise, often
quantified by the performance of the best hypothesis; such results are known as
first-order or small-loss guarantees. While first-order guarantees are
relatively well understood in statistical and online learning, adapting to low
noise in contextual bandits (and more broadly, decision making) presents major
algorithmic challenges. In a COLT 2017 open problem, Agarwal, Krishnamurthy,
Langford, Luo, and Schapire asked whether first-order guarantees are even
possible for contextual bandits and -- if so -- whether they can be attained by
efficient algorithms. We give a resolution to this question by providing an
optimal and efficient reduction from contextual bandits to online regression
with the logarithmic (or, cross-entropy) loss. Our algorithm is simple and
practical, readily accommodates rich function classes, and requires no
distributional assumptions beyond realizability. In a large-scale empirical
evaluation, we find that our approach typically outperforms comparable
non-first-order methods.

On the technical side, we show that the logarithmic loss and an
information-theoretic quantity called the triangular discrimination play a
fundamental role in obtaining first-order guarantees, and we combine this
observation with new refinements to the regression oracle reduction framework
of Foster and Rakhlin. The use of triangular discrimination yields novel
results even for the classical statistical learning model, and we anticipate
that it will find broader use.</span>

                                        <span>Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in urban traffic networks poses a
challenging task due to the complicated dynamics arising in traffic systems. In
recent years, several approaches based on multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL) have been studied experimentally. These approaches propose
distributed techniques in which each signalized intersection is seen as an
agent in a stochastic game whose purpose is to optimize the flow of vehicles in
its vicinity. In this setting, the systems evolves towards an equilibrium among
the agents that shows beneficial for the whole traffic network. A recently
developed multi-agent variant of the well-established advantage actor-critic
(A2C) algorithm, called MA2C (multi-agent A2C) exploits the promising idea of
some communication among the agents. In this view,the agents share their
strategies with other neighbor agents, thereby stabilizing the learning process
even when the agents grow in number and variety. We experimented MA2C in two
traffic networks located in Bologna (Italy) and found that its action
translates into a significant decrease of the amount of pollutants released
into the environment.</span>

approach. From an input monocular RGB video, the video frames are processed by
a transformer network that fuses the observations into a volumetric feature
grid representing the scene; this feature grid is then decoded into an implicit
3D scene representation. Key to our approach is the transformer architecture
that enables the network to learn to attend to the most relevant image frames
for each 3D location in the scene, supervised only by the scene reconstruction
task. Features are fused in a coarse-to-fine fashion, storing fine-level
features only where needed, requiring lower memory storage and enabling fusion
at interactive rates. The feature grid is then decoded to a higher-resolution
scene reconstruction, using an MLP-based surface occupancy prediction from
interpolated coarse-to-fine 3D features. Our approach results in an accurate
surface reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-view stereo depth

poses a great challenge for affective computing systems performing sentiment

debiasing estimator to correct these distributional anomalies in least squares
estimation. Our proposed method takes advantage of the covariance structure
present in the dataset and provides sharper estimates in directions for which
more information has accrued. We establish an asymptotic normality property for
our proposed online debiasing estimator under mild conditions on the data
collection process, and provide asymptotically exact confidence intervals. We
additionally prove a minimax lower bound for the adaptive linear regression
problem, thereby providing a baseline by which to compare estimators. There are
various conditions under which our proposed estimator achieves the minimax
lower bound up to logarithmic factors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
theory via applications to multi-armed bandit, autoregressive time series
estimation, and active learning with exploration.</span>

                                        <span>Density ratio estimation serves as an important technique in the unsupervised
machine learning toolbox. However, such ratios are difficult to estimate for
complex, high-dimensional data, particularly when the densities of interest are
sufficiently different. In our work, we propose to leverage an invertible
generative model to map the two distributions into a common feature space prior
to estimation. This featurization brings the densities closer together in
latent space, sidestepping pathological scenarios where the learned density
ratios in input space can be arbitrarily inaccurate. At the same time, the
invertibility of our feature map guarantees that the ratios computed in feature
space are equivalent to those in input space. Empirically, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in a variety of downstream tasks that require access
to accurate density ratios such as mutual information estimation, targeted
sampling in deep generative models, and classification with data augmentation.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce the problem of sleeping dueling bandits with stochastic
preferences and adversarial availabilities (DB-SPAA). In almost all dueling
bandit applications, the decision space often changes over time; eg, retail
store management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, search engine
optimization, etc. Surprisingly, this &#x60;sleeping aspect&#x27; of dueling bandits has
never been studied in the literature. Like dueling bandits, the goal is to
compete with the best arm by sequentially querying the preference feedback of
item pairs. The non-triviality however results due to the non-stationary item
spaces that allow any arbitrary subsets items to go unavailable every round.
The goal is to find an optimal &#x60;no-regret&#x27; policy that can identify the best
available item at each round, as opposed to the standard &#x60;fixed best-arm regret
objective&#x27; of dueling bandits. We first derive an instance-specific lower bound
for DB-SPAA $\Omega( \sum_{i &#x3D;1}^{K-1}\sum_{j&#x3D;i+1}^K \frac{\log
T}{\Delta(i,j)})$, where $K$ is the number of items and $\Delta(i,j)$ is the
gap between items $i$ and $j$. This indicates that the sleeping problem with
preference feedback is inherently more difficult than that for classical
multi-armed bandits (MAB). We then propose two algorithms, with near optimal
regret guarantees. Our results are corroborated empirically.</span>

from an unknown but shared distribution. However, typical meta-learning
algorithms have assumed the tasks to be similar such that a single meta-learner
is sufficient to aggregate the variations in all aspects. In addition, there
has been less consideration on uncertainty when limited information is given as
context. In this paper, we devise a novel meta-learning framework, called
Meta-learning Amidst Heterogeneity and Ambiguity (MAHA), that outperforms
previous works in terms of prediction based on its ability on task

techniques aim at localizing with high precision high density fluorescent
molecules by stochastically activating and imaging small subsets of blinking
emitters. Super Resolution (SR) plays an important role in this field since it
allows to go beyond the intrinsic light diffraction limit. In this work, we
propose a deep learning-based algorithm for precise molecule localization of
high density frames acquired by SMLM techniques whose $\ell_{2}$-based loss
function is regularized by positivity and $\ell_{0}$-based constraints. The
$\ell_{0}$ is relaxed through its Continuous Exact $\ell_{0}$ (CEL0)
counterpart. The arising approach, named DeepCEL0, is parameter-free, more
flexible, faster and provides more precise molecule localization maps if
compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. We validate our approach on

data-labeling bottleneck prevalent in many machine learning applications, by
replacing the tedious manual collection of ground truth labels. Current state
of the art approaches that do not use any labeled training data, however,
require two separate modeling steps: Learning a probabilistic latent variable
model based on the WS sources -- making assumptions that rarely hold in
practice -- followed by downstream model training. Importantly, the first step
of modeling does not consider the performance of the downstream model. To
address these caveats we propose an end-to-end approach for directly learning
the downstream model by maximizing its agreement with probabilistic labels
generated by reparameterizing previous probabilistic posteriors with a neural
network. Our results show improved performance over prior work in terms of end
model performance on downstream test sets, as well as in terms of improved
robustness to dependencies among weak supervision sources.</span>

tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary
environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines
how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data
in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as
deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current
multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can
detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to
their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in
this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks&#x27; learning dynamics,
emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose
Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the
concept of Continual Learning (CoL), Representation Learning (ReL), and
Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain
adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets,
while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student
model setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
is efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and
GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art
baseline methods.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.
However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3$\times$ as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\times$224
ImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images. The
models and source code will be released soon.</span>

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)
action recognition. However, TAL poses a unique set of challenges. In this
paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the
best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly consider audio and
video modalities for supervised TAL. We experimentally show that our schemes
consistently improve performance for state of the art video-only TAL
approaches. Specifically, they help achieve new state of the art performance on
large-scale benchmark datasets - ActivityNet-1.3 (54.34 mAP@0.5) and THUMOS14
(57.18 mAP@0.5). Our experiments include ablations involving multiple fusion
schemes, modality combinations and TAL architectures. Our code, models and

                                        <span>Image editing techniques enable people to modify the content of an image
without leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence
the detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and
challenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is
usually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation
difficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy
and a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism
to localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is
based on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages
inter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high
pass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery
attention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic
inconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two
types of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal
interdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among
channels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise
inconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to
address the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial
training strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust
performance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial
attacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our
model on them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in
different benchmark datasets.</span>

characters, called polyphonic characters, have multiple pronunciations. As a
prerequisite of performing speech-related generative tasks, the correct
pronunciation must be identified among several candidates. This process is
called Polyphone Disambiguation. Although the problem has been well explored
with both knowledge-based and learning-based approaches, it remains challenging
due to the lack of publicly available labeled datasets and the irregular nature
of polyphone in Mandarin Chinese. In this paper, we propose a novel
semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework for Mandarin Chinese polyphone
disambiguation that can potentially leverage unlimited unlabeled text data. We
explore the effect of various proxy labeling strategies including
entropy-thresholding and lexicon-based labeling. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
In addition, we publish a novel dataset specifically for the polyphone
disambiguation task to promote further researches.</span>

notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

mechanism to efficiently extract information from the encoder. While it is
common practice to draw information from only the last encoder layer, recent
work has proposed to use representations from different encoder layers for
diversified levels of information. Nonetheless, the decoder still obtains only
a single view of the source sequences, which might lead to insufficient
training of the encoder layer stack due to the hierarchy bypassing problem. In
this work, we propose layer-wise cross-view decoding, where for each decoder
layer, together with the representations from the last encoder layer, which
serve as a global view, those from other encoder layers are supplemented for a
stereoscopic view of the source sequences. Systematic experiments show that we
successfully address the hierarchy bypassing problem and substantially improve
the performance of sequence-to-sequence learning with deep representations on

                                        <span>Petri nets, equivalently presentable as vector addition systems with states,
are an established model of concurrency with widespread applications. The
reachability problem, where we ask whether from a given initial configuration
there exists a sequence of valid execution steps reaching a given final
configuration, is the central algorithmic problem for this model. The
complexity of the problem has remained, until recently, one of the hardest open
questions in verification of concurrent systems. A first upper bound has been
provided only in 2015 by Leroux and Schmitz, then refined by the same authors
to non-primitive recursive Ackermannian upper bound in 2019. The exponential
space lower bound, shown by Lipton already in 1976, remained the only known for
over 40 years until a breakthrough non-elementary lower bound by
Czerwi{\&#x27;n}ski, Lasota, Lazic, Leroux and Mazowiecki in 2019. Finally, a
matching Ackermannian lower bound announced this year by Czerwi{\&#x27;n}ski and
Orlikowski, and independently by Leroux, established the complexity of the
problem.

Our contribution is an improvement of the former construction, making it
conceptually simpler and more direct. On the way we improve the lower bound for
vector addition systems with states in fixed dimension (or, equivalently, Petri
nets with fixed number of places): while Czerwi{\&#x27;n}ski and Orlikowski prove
$F_k$-hardness (hardness for $k$th level in Grzegorczyk Hierarchy) in dimension
$6k$, and Leroux in dimension $4k+5$, our simplified construction yields
$F_k$-hardness already in dimension $3k+2$.</span>

                                        <span>Detection of semantic contradictory sentences is one of the most challenging
and fundamental issues for NLP applications such as recognition of textual
entailments. Contradiction in this study includes different types of semantic
confrontation, such as conflict and antonymy. Due to lack of sufficient data to
apply precise machine learning and specifically deep learning methods to
Persian and other low resource languages, rule-based approaches that can
function similarly to these systems will be of a great interest. Also recently,
emergence of new methods such as transfer learning, has opened up the
possibility of deep learning for low-resource languages. Considering two above
points, in this study, along with a simple rule-base baseline, a novel
rule-base system for identifying semantic contradiction along with a Bert base
deep contradiction detection system for Persian texts have been introduced. The
rule base system has used frequent rule mining method to extract appropriate
contradiction rules using a development set. Extracted rules are tested for
different categories of contradictory sentences. In this system the maximum
f-measure among contradiction categories is obtained for negation about 90% and
the average F-measure of system for all classes is about 76% which outperforms
other algorithms on Persian texts. On the other hand, because of medium
performance of rule base system for some categories of contradiction, we use a
Bert base deep learning system using our translated dataset; with average
F-measure of 73. Our hybrid system has f-measure of about 80.</span>

language understanding, is gradually changing medical practice. With the
development of biomedical language understanding benchmarks, AI applications
are widely used in the medical field. However, most benchmarks are limited to
English, which makes it challenging to replicate many of the successes in
English for other languages. To facilitate research in this direction, we
collect real-world biomedical data and present the first Chinese Biomedical
Language Understanding Evaluation (CBLUE) benchmark: a collection of natural
language understanding tasks including named entity recognition, information
extraction, clinical diagnosis normalization, single-sentence/sentence-pair
classification, and an associated online platform for model evaluation,
comparison, and analysis. To establish evaluation on these tasks, we report
empirical results with the current 11 pre-trained Chinese models, and
experimental results show that state-of-the-art neural models perform by far
worse than the human ceiling. Our benchmark is released at

Among those methods, SimCLR greatly advanced the state of the art in
self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. The input feature
representations for speech and visual tasks are both continuous, so it is
natural to consider applying similar objective on speech representation
learning. In this paper, we propose Speech SimCLR, a new self-supervised
objective for speech representation learning. During training, Speech SimCLR
applies augmentation on raw speech and its spectrogram. Its objective is the
combination of contrastive loss that maximizes agreement between differently
augmented samples in the latent space and reconstruction loss of input

                                        <span>Strategies for improving the training and prediction quality of weakly
supervised machine learning models vary in how much they are tailored to a
specific task or integrated with a specific model architecture. In this work,
we introduce Knodle, a software framework that treats weak data annotations,
deep learning models, and methods for improving weakly supervised training as
separate, modular components. This modularization gives the training process
access to fine-grained information such as data set characteristics, matches of
heuristic rules, or elements of the deep learning model ultimately used for
prediction. Hence, our framework can encompass a wide range of training methods
for improving weak supervision, ranging from methods that only look at
correlations of rules and output classes (independently of the machine learning
model trained with the resulting labels), to those that harness the interplay
of neural networks and weakly labeled data. We illustrate the benchmarking
potential of the framework with a performance comparison of several reference
implementations on a selection of datasets that are already available in
Knodle.

The framework is published as an open-source Python package knodle and
available at https://github.com/knodle/knodle.</span>

                                        <span>Query reformulation aims to alter noisy or ambiguous text sequences into
coherent ones closer to natural language questions. This is to prevent errors
from propagating in a client-facing pipeline and promote better communication
with users. Besides, it is crucial to maintain performance in downstream
environments like question answering when rephrased queries are given as input.
We show that under the previous framework (AQA), attempts to alter RL
algorithms do not bring significant benefits to either reward acquisition or
sequence fluency. Instead, we leverage a query-reformulating text-to-text
transformer (QRT5) and apply policy-based RL algorithms to further nudge this
reformulator and obtain better answers downstream by generating
reward-acquiring query trajectories. QRT5 shows better sample efficiency in RL
to achieve the same level of QA performance as the previous approach. It can
generate reformulations with more readability based on query well-formedness
evaluations and can generalize to out-of-sample data. Our framework is
demonstrated to be flexible, allowing reward signals to be sourced from
different downstream environments such as intent classification.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a low-latency real-time (LLRT) non-parallel voice
conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core
of $2.1$--$2.7$ GHz CPU on a real-time factor of $0.87$--$0.95$, including
input/output, feature extraction, on a frame shift of $10$ ms, a window length
of $27.5$ ms, and $2$ lookup frames.</span>

rounds of expression transformation. As a popular way of expressing one&#x27;s
intentions, it is well worth studying. In this paper, we try to make computers
understand whether there is a subtext by means of machine learning. We build a
Chinese dataset whose source data comes from the popular social media (e.g.
Weibo, Netease Music, Zhihu, and Bilibili). In addition, we also build a
baseline model called SASICM to deal with subtext recognition. The F1 score of
SASICMg, whose pretrained model is GloVe, is as high as 64.37%, which is 3.97%
higher than that of BERT based model, 12.7% higher than that of traditional
methods on average, including support vector machine, logistic regression
classifier, maximum entropy classifier, naive bayes classifier and decision
tree and 2.39% higher than that of the state-of-the-art, including MARIN and
BTM. The F1 score of SASICMBERT, whose pretrained model is BERT, is 65.12%,
which is 0.75% higher than that of SASICMg. The accuracy rates of SASICMg and
SASICMBERT are 71.16% and 70.76%, respectively, which can compete with those of
other methods which are mentioned before.</span>

vocoder framework based on multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction
for discrete waveform modeling (MWDLP). MWDLP employs a coarse-fine bit WaveRNN
architecture for 10-bit mu-law waveform modeling. A sparse gated recurrent unit
with a relatively large size of hidden units is utilized, while the multiband
modeling is deployed to achieve real-time low-latency usage. A novel technique
for data-driven linear prediction (LP) with discrete waveform modeling is
proposed, where the LP coefficients are estimated in a data-driven manner.
Moreover, a novel loss function using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for
discrete waveform modeling with Gumbel approximation is also proposed. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MWDLP framework generates
high-fidelity synthetic speech for seen and unseen speakers and/or language on
300 speakers training data including clean and noisy/reverberant conditions,
where the number of training utterances is limited to 60 per speaker, while
allowing for real-time low-latency processing using a single core of $\sim\!$

into Enhanced Universal Dependencies. The task involves parsing Enhanced UD
graphs, which are an extension of the basic dependency trees designed to be
more facilitative towards representing semantic structure. Evaluation is
carried out on 29 treebanks in 17 languages and participants are required to
parse the data from each language starting from raw strings. Our approach uses
the Stanza pipeline to preprocess the text files, XLMRoBERTa to obtain
contextualized token representations, and an edge-scoring and labeling model to
predict the enhanced graph. Finally, we run a post-processing script to ensure
all of our outputs are valid Enhanced UD graphs. Our system places 6th out of 9
participants with a coarse Enhanced Labeled Attachment Score (ELAS) of 83.57.
We carry out additional post-deadline experiments which include using Trankit
for pre-processing, XLM-RoBERTa-LARGE, treebank concatenation, and multitask
learning between a basic and an enhanced dependency parser. All of these
modifications improve our initial score and our final system has a coarse ELAS
of 88.04.</span>

important abilities for advanced natural language understanding (NLU). However,
there are currently no dedicated datasets aiming to test these abilities.
Herein, we present RiddleSense, a new multiple-choice question answering task,

focused on rhyming lyrics but ignored rhythmic beats, which are important for
rap performance. In this paper, we develop DeepRapper, a Transformer-based rap
generation system that can model both rhymes and rhythms. Since there is no
available rap dataset with rhythmic beats, we develop a data mining pipeline to
collect a large-scale rap dataset, which includes a large number of rap songs
with aligned lyrics and rhythmic beats. Second, we design a Transformer-based
autoregressive language model which carefully models rhymes and rhythms.
Specifically, we generate lyrics in the reverse order with rhyme representation
and constraint for rhyme enhancement and insert a beat symbol into lyrics for
rhythm/beat modeling. To our knowledge, DeepRapper is the first system to
generate rap with both rhymes and rhythms. Both objective and subjective
evaluations demonstrate that DeepRapper generates creative and high-quality
raps with rhymes and rhythms. Code will be released on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment analysis is a costly yet necessary task for enterprises to study
the opinions of their customers to improve their products and to determine
optimal marketing strategies. Due to the existence of a wide range of domains
across different products and services, cross-domain sentiment analysis methods
have received significant attention. These methods mitigate the domain gap
between different applications by training cross-domain generalizable
classifiers which help to relax the need for data annotation for each domain.
Most existing methods focus on learning domain-agnostic representations that
are invariant with respect to both the source and the target domains. As a
result, a classifier that is trained using the source domain annotated data
would generalize well in a related target domain. We introduce a new domain
adaptation method which induces large margins between different classes in an
embedding space. This embedding space is trained to be domain-agnostic by
matching the data distributions across the domains. Large intraclass margins in
the source domain help to reduce the effect of &quot;domain shift&quot; on the classifier
performance in the target domain. Theoretical and empirical analysis are
provided to demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment analysis in conversations has gained increasing attention in recent
years for the growing amount of applications it can serve, e.g., sentiment
analysis, recommender systems, and human-robot interaction. The main difference
between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment
analysis is the existence of context information which may influence the
sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual
information in dialogues, however, remains a challenge. Existing approaches
employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in
a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper, we
propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named
bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis.
In our system, a generalized neural tensor block followed by a two-channel
classifier is designed to perform context compositionality and sentiment
classification, respectively. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state of the art in most cases.</span>

work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale
neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this
recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the
challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by
summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and
motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically
representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for
popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges
and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the
landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate
additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper

of Plausible Alternatives (COPA) task. However, whether PLMs have truly
acquired the ability of causal reasoning remains a question. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of semantic similarity bias and reveal the
vulnerability of current COPA models by certain attacks. Previous solutions
that tackle the superficial cues of unbalanced token distribution still
encounter the same problem of semantic bias, even more seriously due to the
utilization of more training data. We mitigate this problem by simply adding a
regularization loss and experimental results show that this solution not only
improves the model&#x27;s generalization ability, but also assists the models to
perform more robustly on a challenging dataset, BCOPA-CE, which has unbiased
token distribution and is more difficult for models to distinguish cause and

model-based evaluation methods, including question answering (QA) approaches,
STS, next-sentence prediction (NSP), and scores derived from 19 pre-trained

dialectal variation of spoken content. Recent studies show its efficacy over
monolingual systems. In this study, we design a large multilingual end-to-end

multi-dialectal (Modern Standard Arabic, along with dialectal variation such as
Egyptian and Moroccan); (iii) code-switching -- cross-lingual (Ar-En/Fr) and

higher-order inference to directly optimizing evaluation metrics using
reinforcement learning. Despite improving the coreference resolution
performance by a large margin, these extensions add a lot of extra complexity

                                        <span>We propose a cross-modal transformer-based neural correction models that
refines the output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system so as to
exclude ASR errors. Generally, neural correction models are composed of
encoder-decoder networks, which can directly model sequence-to-sequence mapping
problems. The most successful method is to use both input speech and its ASR
output text as the input contexts for the encoder-decoder networks. However,
the conventional method cannot take into account the relationships between
these two different modal inputs because the input contexts are separately
encoded for each modal. To effectively leverage the correlated information
between the two different modal inputs, our proposed models encode two
different contexts jointly on the basis of cross-modal self-attention using a
transformer. We expect that cross-modal self-attention can effectively capture
the relationships between two different modals for refining ASR hypotheses. We
also introduce a shallow fusion technique to efficiently integrate the
first-pass ASR model and our proposed neural correction model. Experiments on
Japanese natural language ASR tasks demonstrated that our proposed models
achieve better ASR performance than conventional neural correction models.</span>

the carefully tuned conventional clustering-based methods on challenging
datasets. However, the main drawback is that it cannot deal with the case where
the number of speakers is larger than the one observed during training. This is
because its speaker counting relies on supervised learning. In this work, we
introduce an unsupervised clustering process embedded in the attractor-based
end-to-end diarization. We first split a sequence of frame-wise embeddings into
short subsequences and then perform attractor-based diarization for each
subsequence. Given subsequence-wise diarization results, inter-subsequence
speaker correspondence is obtained by unsupervised clustering of the vectors
computed from the attractors from all the subsequences. This makes it possible
to produce diarization results of a large number of speakers for the whole
recording even if the number of output speakers for each subsequence is
limited. Experimental results showed that our method could produce accurate
diarization results of an unseen number of speakers. Our method achieved 11.84
%, 28.33 %, and 19.49 % on the CALLHOME, DIHARD II, and DIHARD III datasets,
respectively, each of which is better than the conventional end-to-end
diarization methods.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of text generation is to make machines express in human language. It
is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language
processing (NLP). Since 2014, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered
by Seq2Seq have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text
to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge
to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still
far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue,
researchers have considered incorporating various forms of knowledge beyond the
input text into the generation models. This research direction is known as
knowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive
review of the research on knowledge enhanced text generation over the past five
years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and
architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific
techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data.
This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in
academia and industry.</span>

                                        <span>Event extraction (EE) is a crucial information extraction task that aims to
extract event information in texts. Most existing methods assume that events
appear in sentences without overlaps, which are not applicable to the
complicated overlapping event extraction. This work systematically studies the
realistic event overlapping problem, where a word may serve as triggers with
several types or arguments with different roles. To tackle the above problem,
we propose a novel joint learning framework with cascade decoding for
overlapping event extraction, termed as CasEE. Particularly, CasEE sequentially
performs type detection, trigger extraction and argument extraction, where the
overlapped targets are extracted separately conditioned on the specific former
prediction. All the subtasks are jointly learned in a framework to capture
dependencies among the subtasks. The evaluation on a public event extraction
benchmark FewFC demonstrates that CasEE achieves significant improvements on
overlapping event extraction over previous competitive methods.</span>

technology nowadays because of its end-to-end trainable flexibility. However,
NMT still struggles to translate properly in low-resource settings specifically
on distant language pairs. One way to overcome this is to use the information
from other modalities if available. The idea is that despite differences in
languages, both the source and target language speakers see the same thing and
the visual representation of both the source and target is the same, which can
positively assist the system. Multimodal information can help the NMT system to
improve the translation by removing ambiguity on some phrases or words. We
participate in the 8th Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT - 2021) for
English-Hindi multimodal translation task and achieve 42.47 and 37.50 BLEU

multi-talker overlapped automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Fully
neural network based end-to-end models have dramatically improved the
performance of multi-taker overlapped ASR tasks. One promising approach for
end-to-end modeling is autoregressive modeling with serialized output training
in which transcriptions of multiple speakers are recursively generated one
after another. This enables us to naturally capture relationships between
speakers. However, the conventional modeling method cannot explicitly take into
account the speaker attributes of individual utterances such as gender and age
information. In fact, the performance deteriorates when each speaker is the
same gender or is close in age. To address this problem, we propose unified
autoregressive modeling for joint end-to-end multi-talker overlapped ASR and
speaker attribute estimation. Our key idea is to handle gender and age
estimation tasks within the unified autoregressive modeling. In the proposed
method, transformer-based autoregressive model recursively generates not only
textual tokens but also attribute tokens of each speaker. This enables us to
effectively utilize speaker attributes for improving multi-talker overlapped
ASR. Experiments on Japanese multi-talker overlapped ASR tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>While Machine Comprehension (MC) has attracted extensive research interests
in recent years, existing approaches mainly belong to the category of Machine
Reading Comprehension task which mines textual inputs (paragraphs and
questions) to predict the answers (choices or text spans). However, there are a
lot of MC tasks that accept audio input in addition to the textual input, e.g.
English listening comprehension test. In this paper, we target the problem of
Audio-Oriented Multimodal Machine Comprehension, and its goal is to answer
questions based on the given audio and textual information. To solve this
problem, we propose a Dynamic Inter- and Intra-modality Attention (DIIA) model
to effectively fuse the two modalities (audio and textual). DIIA can work as an
independent component and thus be easily integrated into existing MC models.
Moreover, we further develop a Multimodal Knowledge Distillation (MKD) module
to enable our multimodal MC model to accurately predict the answers based only
on either the text or the audio. As a result, the proposed approach can handle
various tasks including: Audio-Oriented Multimodal Machine Comprehension,
Machine Reading Comprehension and Machine Listening Comprehension, in a single
model, making fair comparisons possible between our model and the existing
unimodal MC models. Experimental results and analysis prove the effectiveness
of the proposed approaches. First, the proposed DIIA boosts the baseline models
by up to 21.08% in terms of accuracy; Second, under the unimodal scenarios, the
MKD module allows our multimodal MC model to significantly outperform the
unimodal models by up to 18.87%, which are trained and tested with only audio
or textual data.</span>

performance for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) across several
tasks. Addressing overconfidence in such models, in this paper we introduce the
concept of relaxed attention, which is a simple gradual injection of a uniform
distribution to the encoder-decoder attention weights during training that is
easily implemented with two lines of code. We investigate the effect of relaxed
attention across different AED model architectures and two prominent ASR tasks,
Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Librispeech. We found that transformers trained
with relaxed attention outperform the standard baseline models consistently
during decoding with external language models. On WSJ, we set a new benchmark
for transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition with a word error rate of
3.65%, outperforming state of the art (4.20%) by 13.1% relative, while
introducing only a single hyperparameter. Upon acceptance, models will be
published on github.</span>

                                        <span>Modern neural text generation systems can produce remarkably fluent and
grammatical texts. While earlier language models suffered from repetition and
syntactic errors, the errors made by contemporary models are often semantic,
narrative, or discourse failures.

To facilitate research of these complex error types, we introduce a new
structured, crowdsourced error annotation schema called Scarecrow. The error
categories used in Scarecrow -- such as redundancy, commonsense errors, and
incoherence -- were identified by combining expert analysis with several pilot
rounds of ontology-free crowd annotation to arrive at a schema which covers the
error phenomena found in real machine generated text.

We use Scarecrow to collect 13k annotations of 1.3k human and machine
generate paragraphs of English language news text, amounting to over 41k spans
each labeled with its error category, severity, a natural language explanation,
and antecedent span (where relevant). We collect annotations for text generated
by state-of-the-art systems with varying known performance levels, from GPT-2
Small through the largest GPT-3. We isolate several factors for detailed
analysis, including parameter count, training data, and decoding technique. Our
results show both expected and surprising differences across these settings.
These findings demonstrate the value of Scarecrow annotations in the assessment
of current and future text generation systems. We release our complete
annotation toolkit and dataset at https://yao-dou.github.io/scarecrow/.</span>

potential improvement over monolingual systems. We study key issues related to
multilingual modeling for ASR through a series of large-scale ASR experiments.
Our innovative framework deploys a multi-graph approach in the weighted finite
state transducers (WFST) framework. We compare our WFST decoding strategies
with a transformer sequence to sequence system trained on the same data. Given
a code-switching scenario between Arabic and English languages, our results
show that the WFST decoding approaches were more suitable for the
intersentential code-switching datasets. In addition, the transformer system
performed better for intrasentential code-switching task. With this study, we

generalize systematically on several SCAN tasks. Hence, it is not clear if
SCAN-style compositional generalization is useful in realistic NLP tasks. In
this work, we study the benefit that such compositionality brings about to
several machine translation tasks. We present several focused modifications of
Transformer that greatly improve generalization capabilities on SCAN and select
one that remains on par with a vanilla Transformer on a standard machine
translation (MT) task. Next, we study its performance in low-resource settings
and on a newly introduced distribution-shifted English-French translation task.
Overall, we find that improvements of a SCAN-capable model do not directly
transfer to the resource-rich MT setup. In contrast, in the low-resource setup,
general modifications lead to an improvement of up to 13.1% BLEU score w.r.t. a
vanilla Transformer. Similarly, an improvement of 14% in an accuracy-based
metric is achieved in the introduced compositional English-French translation
task. This provides experimental evidence that the compositional generalization
assessed in SCAN is particularly useful in resource-starved and domain-shifted
scenarios.</span>

fail to explicitly incorporate essential math symbolic constraints, leading to
unexplainable and unreasonable predictions. Herein, we propose Neural-Symbolic
Solver (NS-Solver) to explicitly and seamlessly incorporate different levels of
symbolic constraints by auxiliary tasks. Our NS-Solver consists of a problem
reader to encode problems, a programmer to generate symbolic equations, and a
symbolic executor to obtain answers. Along with target expression supervision,
our solver is also optimized via 4 new auxiliary objectives to enforce
different symbolic reasoning: a) self-supervised number prediction task
predicting both number quantity and number locations; b) commonsense constant
prediction task predicting what prior knowledge (e.g. how many legs a chicken
has) is required; c) program consistency checker computing the semantic loss
between predicted equation and target equation to ensure reasonable equation
mapping; d) duality exploiting task exploiting the quasi duality between
symbolic equation generation and problem&#x27;s part-of-speech generation to enhance
the understanding ability of a solver. Besides, to provide a more realistic and
challenging benchmark for developing a universal and scalable solver, we also
construct a new large-scale MWP benchmark CM17K consisting of 4 kinds of MWPs
(arithmetic, one-unknown linear, one-unknown non-linear, equation set) with
more than 17K samples. Extensive experiments on Math23K and our CM17k
demonstrate the superiority of our NS-Solver compared to state-of-the-art
methods.</span>

Processing(NLP) that aims to automatically identify the most relevant meaning
of the words in a given context. Developing standard WSD test collections can
be mentioned as an important prerequisite for developing and evaluating
different WSD systems in the language of interest. Although many WSD test
collections have been developed for a variety of languages, no standard
All-words WSD benchmark is available for Persian. In this paper, we address
this shortage for the Persian language by introducing SBU-WSD-Corpus, as the
first standard test set for the Persian All-words WSD task. SBU-WSD-Corpus is
manually annotated with senses from the Persian WordNet (FarsNet) sense
inventory. To this end, three annotators used SAMP (a tool for sense annotation
based on FarsNet lexical graph) to perform the annotation task. SBU-WSD-Corpus
consists of 19 Persian documents in different domains such as Sports, Science,
Arts, etc. It includes 5892 content words of Persian running text and 3371
manually sense annotated words (2073 nouns, 566 verbs, 610 adjectives, and 122
adverbs). Providing baselines for future studies on the Persian All-words WSD
task, we evaluate several WSD models on SBU-WSD-Corpus. The corpus is publicly
available at https://github.com/hrouhizadeh/SBU-WSD-Corpus.</span>

notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Worldwide, several cases go undiagnosed due to poor healthcare support in
remote areas. In this context, a centralized system is needed for effective
monitoring and analysis of the medical records. A web-based patient diagnostic
system is a central platform to store the medical history and predict the
possible disease based on the current symptoms experienced by a patient to
ensure faster and accurate diagnosis. Early disease prediction can help the
users determine the severity of the disease and take quick action. The proposed
web-based disease prediction system utilizes machine learning based
classification techniques on a data set acquired from the National Centre of
Disease Control (NCDC). $K$-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest and naive
bayes classification approaches are utilized and an ensemble voting algorithm
is also proposed where each classifier is assigned weights dynamically based on
the prediction confidence. The proposed system is also equipped with a
recommendation scheme to recommend the type of tests based on the existing
symptoms of the patient, so that necessary precautions can be taken. A
centralized database ensures that the medical data is preserved and there is
transparency in the system. The tampering into the system is prevented by
giving the no &quot;updation&quot; rights once the diagnosis is created.</span>

order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural
networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along
with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these
architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data
augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we
propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption
robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more
robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that
vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more
shape bias. Our code is available to reproduce.</span>

                                        <span>Modeling implicit feature interaction patterns is of significant importance
to object detection tasks. However, in the two-stage detectors, due to the
excessive use of hand-crafted components, it is very difficult to reason about
the implicit relationship of the instance features. To tackle this problem, we
analyze three different levels of feature interaction relationships, namely,
the dependency relationship between the cropped local features and global
features, the feature autocorrelation within the instance, and the
cross-correlation relationship between the instances. To this end, we propose a
more compact object detector head network (CODH), which can not only preserve
global context information and condense the information density, but also
allows instance-wise feature enhancement and relational reasoning in a larger
matrix space. Without bells and whistles, our method can effectively improve
the detection performance while significantly reducing the parameters of the
model, e.g., with our method, the parameters of the head network is 0.6 times
smaller than the state-of-the-art Cascade R-CNN, yet the performance boost is
1.3% on COCO test-dev. Without losing generality, we can also build a more
lighter head network for other multi-stage detectors by assembling our method.</span>

for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent
canvas in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas.
Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior
distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable
&#x60;&#x60;what-to-draw&#x27;&#x27; per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves
the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in
the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a
Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used
in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to
pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show
that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like
DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models. Moreover,
we show that our model&#x27;s inherent compositionality and interpretability bring
significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing.

various computer vision tasks but rely on tremendous computational cost. To
solve this problem, existing approaches either compress well-trained
large-scale models or learn lightweight models with carefully designed network
structures. In this work, we make a close study of the convolution operator,
which is the basic unit used in CNNs, to reduce its computing load. In
particular, we propose a compact convolution module, called CompConv, to
facilitate efficient feature learning. With the divide-and-conquer strategy,
CompConv is able to save a great many computations as well as parameters to
produce a certain dimensional feature map. Furthermore, CompConv discreetly
integrates the input features into the outputs to efficiently inherit the input
information. More importantly, the novel CompConv is a plug-and-play module
that can be directly applied to modern CNN structures to replace the vanilla
convolution layers without further effort. Extensive experimental results
suggest that CompConv can adequately compress the benchmark CNN structures yet
barely sacrifice the performance, surpassing other competitors.</span>

only sparse depth as input, not images, so the method is not affected by the
covariate shift when attempting to transfer learned models from synthetic data

topology estimation, and use the image to refine the prediction based on

                                        <span>Feature pyramid network (FPN) is a critical component in modern object
detection frameworks. The performance gain in most of the existing FPN variants
is mainly attributed to the increase of computational burden. An attempt to
enhance the FPN is enriching the spatial information by expanding the receptive
fields, which is promising to largely improve the detection accuracy. In this
paper, we first investigate how expanding the receptive fields affect the
accuracy and computational costs of FPN. We explore a baseline model called
inception FPN in which each lateral connection contains convolution filters
with different kernel sizes. Moreover, we point out that not all objects need
such a complicated calculation and propose a new dynamic FPN (DyFPN). The
output features of DyFPN will be calculated by using the adaptively selected
branch according to a dynamic gating operation. Therefore, the proposed method
can provide a more efficient dynamic inference for achieving a better trade-off
between accuracy and computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on
MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the proposed DyFPN significantly improves
performance with the optimal allocation of computation resources. For instance,
replacing inception FPN with DyFPN reduces about 40% of its FLOPs while
maintaining similar high performance.</span>

but a common drawback is that rotation invariance is not ensured, leading to
poor generalization to arbitrary orientations. In this paper, we introduce a
new low-level purely rotation-invariant representation to replace common 3D
Cartesian coordinates as the network inputs. Also, we present a network
architecture to embed these representations into features, encoding local
relations between points and their neighbors, and the global shape structure.
To alleviate inevitable global information loss caused by the
rotation-invariant representations, we further introduce a region relation
convolution to encode local and non-local information. We evaluate our method
on multiple point cloud analysis tasks, including shape classification, part
segmentation, and shape retrieval. Experimental results show that our method
achieves consistent, and also the best performance, on inputs at arbitrary

                                        <span>Crowd counting has drawn much attention due to its importance in
safety-critical surveillance systems. Especially, deep neural network (DNN)
methods have significantly reduced estimation errors for crowd counting
missions. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, i.e., normal images with human-imperceptible perturbations
could mislead DNNs to make false predictions. In this work, we propose a robust
attack strategy called Adversarial Patch Attack with Momentum (APAM) to
systematically evaluate the robustness of crowd counting models, where the
attacker&#x27;s goal is to create an adversarial perturbation that severely degrades
their performances, thus leading to public safety accidents (e.g., stampede
accidents). Especially, the proposed attack leverages the extreme-density
background information of input images to generate robust adversarial patches
via a series of transformations (e.g., interpolation, rotation, etc.). We
observe that by perturbing less than 6\% of image pixels, our attacks severely
degrade the performance of crowd counting systems, both digitally and
physically. To better enhance the adversarial robustness of crowd counting
models, we propose the first regression model-based Randomized Ablation (RA),
which is more sufficient than Adversarial Training (ADT) (Mean Absolute Error
of RA is 5 lower than ADT on clean samples and 30 lower than ADT on adversarial
examples). Extensive experiments on five crowd counting models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. Code is available at

                                        <span>Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples
into clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in
numerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,
image segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the
existing clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is
the dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.
number of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the
literature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation
metrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and
memory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we
apply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to
detect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with
their sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a
DL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of
initialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated
clusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the
incoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that
the proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization
parameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing
solutions.</span>

                                        <span>Recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results and runtime
advantages in deformable image registration. However, analyzing the effects of
hyperparameters and searching for optimal regularization parameters prove to be
too prohibitive in deep learning-based methods. This is because it involves
training a substantial number of separate models with distinct hyperparameter
values. In this paper, we propose a conditional image registration method and a
new self-supervised learning paradigm for deep deformable image registration.
By learning the conditional features that are correlated with the
regularization hyperparameter, we demonstrate that optimal solutions with
arbitrary hyperparameters can be captured by a single deep convolutional neural
network. In addition, the smoothness of the resulting deformation field can be
manipulated with arbitrary strength of smoothness regularization during
inference. Extensive experiments on a large-scale brain MRI dataset show that
our proposed method enables the precise control of the smoothness of the
deformation field without sacrificing the runtime advantage or registration
accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Domain shift is a major challenge for object detectors to generalize well to
real world applications. Emerging techniques of domain adaptation for two-stage
detectors help to tackle this problem. However, two-stage detectors are not the
first choice for industrial applications due to its long time consumption. In
this paper, a novel Domain Adaptive YOLO (DA-YOLO) is proposed to improve
cross-domain performance for one-stage detectors. Image level features
alignment is used to strictly match for local features like texture, and
loosely match for global features like illumination. Multi-scale instance level
features alignment is presented to reduce instance domain shift effectively ,
such as variations in object appearance and viewpoint. A consensus
regularization to these domain classifiers is employed to help the network
generate domain-invariant detections. We evaluate our proposed method on
popular datasets like Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K and etc.. The results
demonstrate significant improvement when tested under different cross-domain
scenarios.</span>

efficient models for various computer vision applications such as
classification, segmentation, and detection. However, learning highly accurate
models relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Due to
this, model performance drops drastically when evaluated on label-scarce
datasets having visually distinct images, termed as domain adaptation problem.
There is a plethora of works to adapt classification and segmentation models to
label-scarce target datasets through unsupervised domain adaptation.
Considering that detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, many
recent works have focused on developing novel domain adaptive detection
techniques. Here, we describe in detail the domain adaptation problem for
detection and present an extensive survey of the various methods. Furthermore,
we highlight strategies proposed and the associated shortcomings. Subsequently,
we identify multiple aspects of the problem that are most promising for future
research. We believe that this survey shall be valuable to the pattern

nanomedicine in imaging and treatment, but computational models to describe the
NPs distribution remain unavailable due to the complex tumor-nano interactions.
Here, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network for Distribution Analysis
(GANDA) to describe and conditionally generates the intratumoral quantum dots
(QDs) distribution after i.v. injection. This deep generative model is trained
automatically by 27 775 patches of tumor vessels and cell nuclei decomposed
from whole-slide images of 4T1 breast cancer sections. The GANDA model can
conditionally generate images of intratumoral QDs distribution under the
constraint of given tumor vessels and cell nuclei channels with the same
spatial resolution (pixels-to-pixels), minimal loss (mean squared error, MSE &#x3D;
1.871) and excellent reliability (intraclass correlation, ICC &#x3D; 0.94).
Quantitative analysis of QDs extravasation distance (ICC &#x3D; 0.95) and subarea
distribution (ICC &#x3D; 0.99) is allowed on the generated images without knowing
the real QDs distribution. We believe this deep generative model may provide
opportunities to investigate how influencing factors affect NPs distribution in

                                        <span>A key challenge in adversarial robustness is the lack of a precise
mathematical characterization of human perception, used in the very definition
of adversarial attacks that are imperceptible to human eyes. Most current
attacks and defenses try to avoid this issue by considering restrictive
adversarial threat models such as those bounded by $L_2$ or $L_\infty$
distance, spatial perturbations, etc. However, models that are robust against
any of these restrictive threat models are still fragile against other threat
models. To resolve this issue, we propose adversarial training against the set
of all imperceptible adversarial examples, approximated using deep neural
networks. We call this threat model the neural perceptual threat model (NPTM);
it includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance (a
neural network-based approximation of the true perceptual distance) to natural
images. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the neural
perceptual distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of
adversarial examples, validating our threat model.

Under the NPTM, we develop novel perceptual adversarial attacks and defenses.
Because the NPTM is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training
(PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of
adversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against five
diverse adversarial attacks. We find that PAT achieves state-of-the-art
robustness against the union of these five attacks, more than doubling the
accuracy over the next best model, without training against any of them. That
is, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in
sensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and
to the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial training defense
with this property.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposed a new methodology for machine learning in 2-dimensional
space (2-D ML) in inline coordinates. It is a full machine learning approach
that does not require to deal with n-dimensional data in n-dimensional space.
It allows discovering n-D patterns in 2-D space without loss of n-D information
using graph representations of n-D data in 2-D. Specifically, it can be done
with the inline based coordinates in different modifications, including static
and dynamic ones. The classification and regression algorithms based on these
inline coordinates were introduced. A successful case study based on a
benchmark data demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. This approach
helps to consolidate further a whole new area of full 2-D machine learning as a
promising ML methodology. It has advantages of abilities to involve actively
the end-users into the discovering of models and their justification. Another
advantage is providing interpretable ML models.</span>

spite of their prevalence, there are few public datasets for detailed
evaluation of computer vision algorithms on fisheye images. We release the
first extensive fisheye automotive dataset, WoodScape, named after Robert Wood
who invented the fisheye camera in 1906. WoodScape comprises of four surround
view cameras and nine tasks including segmentation, depth estimation, 3D
bounding box detection and soiling detection. Semantic annotation of 40 classes
at the instance level is provided for over 10,000 images and annotation for
other tasks are provided for over 100,000 images. With WoodScape, we would like
to encourage the community to adapt computer vision models for fisheye camera
instead of using naive rectification.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the challenging multi-person 3D body mesh estimation task in this
work. Existing methods are mostly two-stage based--one stage for person
localization and the other stage for individual body mesh estimation, leading
to redundant pipelines with high computation cost and degraded performance for
complex scenes (e.g., occluded person instances). In this work, we present a
single-stage model, Body Meshes as Points (BMP), to simplify the pipeline and
lift both efficiency and performance. In particular, BMP adopts a new method
that represents multiple person instances as points in the spatial-depth space
where each point is associated with one body mesh. Hinging on such
representations, BMP can directly predict body meshes for multiple persons in a
single stage by concurrently localizing person instance points and estimating
the corresponding body meshes. To better reason about depth ordering of all the
persons within the same scene, BMP designs a simple yet effective
inter-instance ordinal depth loss to obtain depth-coherent body mesh
estimation. BMP also introduces a novel keypoint-aware augmentation to enhance
model robustness to occluded person instances. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks Panoptic, MuPoTS-3D and 3DPW clearly demonstrate the
state-of-the-art efficiency of BMP for multi-person body mesh estimation,
together with outstanding accuracy. Code can be found at:

                                        <span>Subtype Discovery consists in finding interpretable and consistent sub-parts
of a dataset, which are also relevant to a certain supervised task. From a
mathematical point of view, this can be defined as a clustering task driven by
supervised learning in order to uncover subgroups in line with the supervised
prediction. In this paper, we propose a general Expectation-Maximization
ensemble framework entitled UCSL (Unsupervised Clustering driven by Supervised
Learning). Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and
can be driven by both binary classification and regression. We propose to
construct a non-linear model by merging multiple linear estimators, one per
cluster. Each hyperplane is estimated so that it correctly discriminates - or
predict - only one cluster. We use SVC or Logistic Regression for
classification and SVR for regression. Furthermore, to perform cluster analysis
within a more suitable space, we also propose a dimension-reduction algorithm
that projects the data onto an orthonormal space relevant to the supervised
task. We analyze the robustness and generalization capability of our algorithm
using synthetic and experimental datasets. In particular, we validate its
ability to identify suitable consistent sub-types by conducting a
psychiatric-diseases cluster analysis with known ground-truth labels. The gain
of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art techniques is about +1.9
points in terms of balanced accuracy. Finally, we make codes and examples
available in a scikit-learn-compatible Python package at

EnSemble), a new method for unsupervised outlier detection (UOD). More
precisely, given any autoencoder for UOD, this technique can be used to improve
its accuracy while at the same time removing the burden of tuning its
regularization. The idea is to not regularize at all, but to rather randomly
partition the data into sufficiently many equally sized parts, overfit each
part with its own autoencoder, and to use the maximum over all autoencoder
reconstruction errors as the anomaly score. We apply our model to various
realistic datasets and show that if the set of inliers is dense enough, our
method indeed improves the UOD performance of a given autoencoder
significantly. For reproducibility, the code is made available on github so the
reader can recreate the results in this paper as well as apply the method to

have achieved great progress, while the study of catastrophic forgetting in
unsupervised learning is still blank. Among unsupervised learning methods,
self-supervise learning method shows tremendous potential on visual

method. However, in the current paradigm, packing previous data and current
data together and training it again is a waste of time and resources. Thus, a
continual self-supervised learning method is badly needed. In this paper, we
make the first attempt to implement the continual contrastive self-supervised
learning by proposing a rehearsal method, which keeps a few exemplars from the
previous data. Instead of directly combining saved exemplars with the current
data set for training, we leverage self-supervised knowledge distillation to
transfer contrastive information among previous data to the current network by
mimicking similarity score distribution inferred by the old network over a set
of saved exemplars. Moreover, we build an extra sample queue to assist the
network to distinguish between previous and current data and prevent mutual
interference while learning their own feature representation. Experimental
results show that our method performs well on CIFAR100 and ImageNet-Sub.
Compared with self-supervised baselines, which learning tasks one by one
without taking any technique, we improve the image classification top-1
accuracy by 1.60% on CIFAR100 and 2.86% on ImageNet-Sub under 10 incremental
steps setting.</span>

Neural-Symbolic techniques, such as Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), allow the
combination of semantic knowledge representation and reasoning with the ability
to efficiently learn from examples typical of neural networks. We here propose
Faster-LTN, an object detector composed of a convolutional backbone and an LTN.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine both

optimizing a grounded theory which combines labelled examples with prior

                                        <span>Despite the impressive progress in the field of presentation attack detection
and multimedia forensics over the last decade, these systems are still
vulnerable to attacks in real-life settings. Some of the challenges for
existing solutions are the detection of unknown attacks, the ability to perform
in adversarial settings, few-shot learning, and explainability. In this study,
these limitations are approached by reliance on a game-theoretic view for
modeling the interactions between the attacker and the detector. Consequently,
a new optimization criterion is proposed and a set of requirements are defined
for improving the performance of these systems in real-life settings.
Furthermore, a novel detection technique is proposed using generator-based
feature sets that are not biased towards any specific attack species. To
further optimize the performance on known attacks, a new loss function coined
categorical margin maximization loss (C-marmax) is proposed which gradually
improves the performance against the most powerful attack. The proposed
approach provides a more balanced performance across known and unknown attacks
and achieves state-of-the-art performance in known and unknown attack detection
cases against rational attackers. Lastly, the few-shot learning potential of
the proposed approach is studied as well as its ability to provide pixel-level
explainability.</span>

shape understanding tasks, such as shape-text matching, retrieval, and shape
captioning. Current multi-view based methods learn a mapping from multiple
rendered views to text. However, these methods can not analyze 3D shapes well
due to the self-occlusion and limitation of learning manifolds. To resolve this
issue, we propose a method to learn joint embedding of point clouds and text by
matching parts from shapes to words from sentences in a common space.
Specifically, we first learn segmentation prior to segment point clouds into
parts. Then, we map parts and words into an optimized space, where the parts
and words can be matched with each other. In the optimized space, we represent
a part by aggregating features of all points within the part, while
representing each word with its context information, where we train our network
to minimize the triplet ranking loss. Moreover, we also introduce cross-modal
attention to capture the relationship of part-word in this matching procedure,
which enhances joint embedding learning. Our experimental results outperform
the state-of-the-art in multi-modal retrieval under the widely used benchmark.</span>

however they are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are
inputs that have been carefully perturbed to fool classifier networks, while
appearing unchanged to humans. Based on prior works on detecting adversaries,
we propose a structured methodology of augmenting a deep neural network (DNN)
with a detector subnetwork. We use $\textit{Adversarial Noise Sensitivity}$
(ANS), a novel metric for measuring the adversarial gradient contribution of
different intermediate layers of a network. Based on the ANS value, we append a
detector to the most sensitive layer. In prior works, more complex detectors
were added to a DNN, increasing the inference computational cost of the model.
In contrast, our structured and strategic addition of a detector to a DNN
reduces the complexity of the model while making the overall network
adversarially resilient. Through comprehensive white-box and black-box
experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, we show that our method improves
state-of-the-art detector robustness against adversarial examples. Furthermore,
we validate the energy efficiency of our proposed adversarial detection
methodology through an extensive energy analysis on various hardware scalable
CMOS accelerator platforms. We also demonstrate the effects of quantization on
our detector-appended networks.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data
as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual
transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then
calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are
of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity
of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in
different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention
inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers
with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN
Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g.,
16$\times$16) as &quot;visual sentences&quot; and present to further divide them into
smaller patches (e.g., 4$\times$4) as &quot;visual words&quot;. The attention of each
word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with
negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be
aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture,
e.g., we achieve an $81.5%$ top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about
$1.7%$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar
computational cost. The PyTorch code is available at

uses video frame clustering as a pretext task and simultaneously performs
representation learning and online clustering. This is in contrast with prior
works where representation learning and clustering are often performed
sequentially. We leverage temporal information in videos by employing temporal
optimal transport and temporal coherence loss. In particular, we incorporate a
temporal regularization term into the standard optimal transport module, which
preserves the temporal order of the activity, yielding the temporal optimal
transport module for computing pseudo-label cluster assignments. Next, the
temporal coherence loss encourages neighboring video frames to be mapped to
nearby points while distant video frames are mapped to farther away points in
the embedding space. The combination of these two components results in
effective representations for unsupervised activity segmentation. Furthermore,
previous methods require storing learned features for the entire dataset before
clustering them in an offline manner, whereas our approach processes one
mini-batch at a time in an online manner. Extensive evaluations on three public
datasets, i.e. 50-Salads, YouTube Instructions, and Breakfast, and our dataset,
i.e., Desktop Assembly, show that our approach performs on par or better than

to a target domain while preserving the content representations. I2I has drawn
increasing attention and made tremendous progress in recent years because of
its wide range of applications in many computer vision and image processing
problems, such as image synthesis, segmentation, style transfer, restoration,
and pose estimation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the I2I works
developed in recent years. We will analyze the key techniques of the existing
I2I works and clarify the main progress the community has made. Additionally,
we will elaborate on the effect of I2I on the research and industry community

                                        <span>In this paper, we introduce a Grasp Manifold Estimator (GraspME) to detect
grasp affordances for objects directly in 2D camera images. To perform
manipulation tasks autonomously it is crucial for robots to have such
graspability models of the surrounding objects. Grasp manifolds have the
advantage of providing continuously infinitely many grasps, which is not the
case when using other grasp representations such as predefined grasp points.
For instance, this property can be leveraged in motion optimization to define
goal sets as implicit surface constraints in the robot configuration space. In
this work, we restrict ourselves to the case of estimating possible
end-effector positions directly from 2D camera images. To this extend, we
define grasp manifolds via a set of key points and locate them in images using
a Mask R-CNN backbone. Using learned features allows generalizing to different
view angles, with potentially noisy images, and objects that were not part of
the training set. We rely on simulation data only and perform experiments on
simple and complex objects, including unseen ones. Our framework achieves an
inference speed of 11.5 fps on a GPU, an average precision for keypoint
estimation of 94.5% and a mean pixel distance of only 1.29. This shows that we
can estimate the objects very well via bounding boxes and segmentation masks as
well as approximate the correct grasp manifold&#x27;s keypoint coordinates.</span>

                                        <span>Spine-related diseases have high morbidity and cause a huge burden of social
cost. Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and
assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT)
images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical
diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available
annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a
large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based
segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this
paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated
from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT
volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal
conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae
segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this
large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related
image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation,
labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image
super-resolution, and enhancement.</span>

mathematical results concerning the probability distribution of image pixel
intensities characterized as generic $2D$ integer arrays. The size of the
smallest bounded region within an image is estimated for segmenting an image,
from which, the equilibrium distribution of intensities can be recovered. From
the estimated bounded regions, properties of the sub-optimal and equilibrium
distributions of intensities are derived, which leads to an image compression
methodology whereby only slightly more than half of all pixels are required for
a worst-case reconstruction of the original image. A custom deep belief network
and heuristic allows for the unsupervised segmentation, detection and
localization of objects in an image. An example illustrates the mathematical
results.</span>

                                        <span>Could we compress images via standard codecs while avoiding visible
artifacts? The answer is obvious -- this is doable as long as the bit budget is
generous enough. What if the allocated bit-rate for compression is
insufficient? Then unfortunately, artifacts are a fact of life. Many attempts
were made over the years to fight this phenomenon, with various degrees of
success. In this work we aim to break the unholy connection between bit-rate
and image quality, and propose a way to circumvent compression artifacts by
pre-editing the incoming image and modifying its content to fit the given bits.
We design this editing operation as a learned convolutional neural network, and
formulate an optimization problem for its training. Our loss takes into account
a proximity between the original image and the edited one, a bit-budget penalty
over the proposed image, and a no-reference image quality measure for forcing
the outcome to be visually pleasing. The proposed approach is demonstrated on
the popular JPEG compression, showing savings in bits and/or improvements in
visual quality, obtained with intricate editing effects.</span>

segmentation task. However, most of the current popular deep neural networks do
not pay much attention to the object edge information. Inspired by the human
annotation process when making instance segmentation datasets, in this paper,
we propose Mask Point R-CNN aiming at promoting the neural network&#x27;s attention
to the object boundary. Specifically, we innovatively extend the original human
keypoint detection task to the contour point detection of any object. Based on
this analogy, we present an contour point detection auxiliary task to Mask
R-CNN, which can boost the gradient flow between different tasks by effectively
using feature fusion strategies and multi-task joint training. As a
consequence, the model will be more sensitive to the edges of the object and
can capture more geometric features. Quantitatively, the experimental results
show that our approach outperforms vanilla Mask R-CNN by 3.8\% on Cityscapes

are scarce, there are abundant auxiliary datasets that potentially contain
useful information. We propose the problem of extended few-shot learning to
study these scenarios. We then introduce a framework to address the challenges
of efficiently selecting and effectively using auxiliary data in few-shot image
classification. Given a large auxiliary dataset and a notion of semantic
similarity among classes, we automatically select pseudo shots, which are
labeled examples from other classes related to the target task. We show that
naive approaches, such as (1) modeling these additional examples the same as
the target task examples or (2) using them to learn features via transfer
learning, only increase accuracy by a modest amount. Instead, we propose a
masking module that adjusts the features of auxiliary data to be more similar
to those of the target classes. We show that this masking module performs
better than naively modeling the support examples and transfer learning by 4.68

follows a scaling law with interpretable coefficients that depend on the

networks, showing it is predictable in terms of an invariant tying width,
depth, and pruning level, such that networks of vastly different pruned
densities are interchangeable. We demonstrate the accuracy of this
approximation over orders of magnitude in depth, width, dataset size, and

                                        <span>While GANs have shown success in realistic image generation, the idea of
using GANs for other tasks unrelated to synthesis is underexplored. Do GANs
learn meaningful structural parts of objects during their attempt to reproduce
those objects? In this work, we test this hypothesis and propose a simple and
effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires
as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset. Our key idea is to
leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise representation from the input
image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments
demonstrate that GANs representation is &quot;readily discriminative&quot; and produces
surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised
baselines trained with significantly more labels. We believe this novel
repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation
learning that is applicable to many other tasks. More results are available at

people so far. The virus has destructive effects on the human lung, and early
detection is very important. Deep Convolution neural networks are such powerful
tools in classifying images. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid approach based
on a deep network is presented. Feature vectors were extracted by applying a
deep convolution neural network on the images, and useful features were
selected by the binary differential meta-heuristic algorithm. These optimized
features were given to the SVM classifier. A database consisting of three
categories of images such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy included in 1092
X-ray samples was considered. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
99.43%, a sensitivity of 99.16%, and a specificity of 99.57%. Our results

object from one image into another background image, where the placement (e.g.,
location, size, occlusion) of inserted object may be unreasonable, which would
significantly degrade the quality of the composite image. Although some works
attempted to learn object placement to create realistic composite images, they

we focus on object placement assessment task, which verifies whether a

this task, we construct the first Object Placement Assessment (OPA) dataset

resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is a crucial step needed for planning the treatment
of atrial fibrillation. However, automatic LA segmentation from LGE MRI is
still challenging, due to the poor image quality, high variability in LA
shapes, and unclear LA boundary. Though deep learning-based methods can provide
promising LA segmentation results, they often generalize poorly to unseen
domains, such as data from different scanners and/or sites. In this work, we
collect 210 LGE MRIs from different centers with different levels of image
quality. To evaluate the domain generalization ability of models on the LA
segmentation task, we employ four commonly used semantic segmentation networks
for the LA segmentation from multi-center LGE MRIs. Besides, we investigate
three domain generalization strategies, i.e., histogram matching, mutual
information based disentangled representation, and random style transfer, where
a simple histogram matching is proved to be most effective.</span>

popular CV datasets to expose their harms. These works tend to treat datasets

here that we could further systematize our analysis of harms by examining CV
data pipelines through a process-oriented lens that captures the creation, the

process-oriented lens, we embarked on an empirical study of CV data pipelines
informed by the field of method engineering. We present here a preliminary

researchers in discovering understudied issues, and could help practitioners in

                                        <span>Graph learning has emerged as a promising technique for multi-view clustering
with its ability to learn a unified and robust graph from multiple views.
However, existing graph learning methods mostly focus on the multi-view
consistency issue, yet often neglect the inconsistency across multiple views,
which makes them vulnerable to possibly low-quality or noisy datasets. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a new multi-view graph learning framework,
which for the first time simultaneously and explicitly models multi-view
consistency and multi-view inconsistency in a unified objective function,
through which the consistent and inconsistent parts of each single-view graph
as well as the unified graph that fuses the consistent parts can be iteratively
learned. Though optimizing the objective function is NP-hard, we design a
highly efficient optimization algorithm which is able to obtain an approximate
solution with linear time complexity in the number of edges in the unified
graph. Furthermore, our multi-view graph learning approach can be applied to
both similarity graphs and dissimilarity graphs, which lead to two graph
fusion-based variants in our framework. Experiments on twelve multi-view
datasets have demonstrated the robustness and efficiency of the proposed
approach.</span>

                                        <span>As a critical component for online advertising and marking, click-through
rate (CTR) prediction has draw lots of attentions from both industry and
academia field. Recently, the deep learning has become the mainstream
methodological choice for CTR. Despite of sustainable efforts have been made,
existing approaches still pose several challenges. On the one hand, high-order
interaction between the features is under-explored. On the other hand,
high-order interactions may neglect the semantic information from the low-order
fields. In this paper, we proposed a novel prediction method, named FINT, that
employs the Field-aware INTeraction layer which captures high-order feature
interactions while retaining the low-order field information. To empirically
investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the FINT, we perform extensive
experiments on the three realistic databases: KDD2012, Criteo and Avazu. The
obtained results demonstrate that the FINT can significantly improve the
performance compared to the existing methods, without increasing the amount of
computation required. Moreover, the proposed method brought about 2.72\%
increase to the advertising revenue of a big online video app through A/B
testing. To better promote the research in CTR field, we will release our code
as well as reference implementation of those baseline models in the final
version.</span>

module and a subsequent recognition module, running one after the other. In
this paper, we reformulate the workings of a typical fingerprint recognition
system. In particular, we posit that both spoof detection and fingerprint
recognition are correlated tasks. Therefore, rather than performing the two
tasks separately, we propose a joint model for spoof detection and matching to
simultaneously perform both tasks without compromising the accuracy of either
task. We demonstrate the capability of our joint model to obtain an
authentication accuracy (1:1 matching) of TAR &#x3D; 100% @ FAR &#x3D; 0.1% on the FVC
2006 DB2A dataset while achieving a spoof detection ACE of 1.44% on the LiveDet
2015 dataset, both maintaining the performance of stand-alone methods. In
practice, this reduces the time and memory requirements of the fingerprint
recognition system by 50% and 40%, respectively; a significant advantage for
recognition systems running on resource-constrained devices and communication

of 3D shapes. Significant progress has been made in developing methods for
point cloud analysis, which often requires costly human annotation as
supervision in practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel
self-contrastive learning for self-supervised point cloud representation
learning, aiming to capture both local geometric patterns and nonlocal semantic
primitives based on the nonlocal self-similarity of point clouds. The
contributions are two-fold: on the one hand, instead of contrasting among
different point clouds as commonly employed in contrastive learning, we exploit
self-similar point cloud patches within a single point cloud as positive
samples and otherwise negative ones to facilitate the task of contrastive
learning. Such self-contrastive learning is well aligned with the emerging
paradigm of self-supervised learning for point cloud analysis. On the other
hand, we actively learn hard negative samples that are close to positive
samples in the representation space for discriminative feature learning, which
are sampled conditional on each anchor patch leveraging on the degree of
self-similarity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmark datasets for
self-supervised point cloud segmentation and transfer learning for
classification.</span>

architecture, but a convolution-free transformer-based generator. In our paper,
we explain how a transformer can generate high-quality images, overcoming the
disadvantage that convolution operations are difficult to capture global
features in an image. Furthermore, we change the demodulation of StyleGAN2 and
modify the existing transformer structure (e.g., residual connection, layer
normalization) to create a strong style-based generator with a convolution-free
structure. We also make Styleformer lighter by applying Linformer, enabling
Styleformer to generate higher resolution images and result in improvements in
terms of speed and memory. We experiment with the low-resolution image dataset
such as CIFAR-10, as well as the high-resolution image dataset like
LSUN-church. Styleformer records FID 2.82 and IS 9.94 on CIFAR-10, a benchmark
dataset, which is comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art and
outperforms all GAN-based generative models, including StyleGAN2-ADA with fewer
parameters on the unconditional setting. We also both achieve new

                                        <span>In real applications, new object classes often emerge after the detection
model has been trained on a prepared dataset with fixed classes. Due to the
storage burden and the privacy of old data, sometimes it is impractical to
train the model from scratch with both old and new data. Fine-tuning the old
model with only new data will lead to a well-known phenomenon of catastrophic
forgetting, which severely degrades the performance of modern object detectors.
In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew
\textbf{C}orrelation \textbf{D}istillation (MVCD) based incremental object
detection method, which explores the correlations in the feature space of the
two-stage object detector (Faster R-CNN). To better transfer the knowledge
learned from the old classes and maintain the ability to learn new classes, we
design correlation distillation losses from channel-wise, point-wise and
instance-wise views to regularize the learning of the incremental model. A new
metric named Stability-Plasticity-mAP is proposed to better evaluate both the
stability for old classes and the plasticity for new classes in incremental
object detection. The extensive experiments conducted on VOC2007 and COCO
demonstrate that MVCD can effectively learn to detect objects of new classes
and mitigate the problem of catastrophic forgetting.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation have achieved
unprecedented progress. In this paper, we propose Complete-IoU (CIoU) loss and
Cluster-NMS for enhancing geometric factors in both bounding box regression and
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), leading to notable gains of average precision
(AP) and average recall (AR), without the sacrifice of inference efficiency. In
particular, we consider three geometric factors, i.e., overlap area, normalized
central point distance and aspect ratio, which are crucial for measuring
bounding box regression in object detection and instance segmentation. The
three geometric factors are then incorporated into CIoU loss for better
distinguishing difficult regression cases. The training of deep models using
CIoU loss results in consistent AP and AR improvements in comparison to widely
adopted $\ell_n$-norm loss and IoU-based loss. Furthermore, we propose
Cluster-NMS, where NMS during inference is done by implicitly clustering
detected boxes and usually requires less iterations. Cluster-NMS is very
efficient due to its pure GPU implementation, and geometric factors can be
incorporated to improve both AP and AR. In the experiments, CIoU loss and
Cluster-NMS have been applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g.,
YOLACT and BlendMask-RT), and object detection (e.g., YOLO v3, SSD and Faster
R-CNN) models. Taking YOLACT on MS COCO as an example, our method achieves
performance gains as +1.7 AP and +6.2 AR$_{100}$ for object detection, and +0.9
AP and +3.5 AR$_{100}$ for instance segmentation, with 27.1 FPS on one NVIDIA
GTX 1080Ti GPU. All the source code and trained models are available at

the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 there has been a rush for developing
Artificial Intelligence techniques for expert-level disease identification on
Chest X-ray data. In particular, the use of deep supervised learning has become
the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily
dependent on the availability of a large and representative labelled dataset.
The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and
especially imposes a great challenge for a novel disease. Semi-supervised
learning has shown the ability to match the incredible performance of
supervised models whilst requiring a small fraction of the labelled examples.
This makes the semi-supervised paradigm an attractive option for identifying
COVID-19. In this work, we introduce a graph based deep semi-supervised
framework for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Our framework introduces
an optimisation model for graph diffusion that reinforces the natural relation
among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled data. We then connect the
diffusion prediction output as pseudo-labels that are used in an iterative
scheme in a deep net. We demonstrate, through our experiments, that our model
is able to outperform the current leading supervised model with a tiny fraction
of the labelled examples. Finally, we provide attention maps to accommodate the
radiologist&#x27;s mental model, better fitting their perceptual and cognitive
abilities. These visualisation aims to assist the radiologist in judging
whether the diagnostic is correct or not, and in consequence to accelerate the
decision.</span>

                                        <span>Direct methods are widely used for alignment of models to images, due to
their accuracy, since they minimize errors in the domain of measurement noise.
They have leveraged least squares minimizations, for simple, efficient,
variational optimization, since the seminal 1981 work of Lucas &amp; Kanade, and
normalized cross correlation (NCC), for robustness to intensity variations,
since at least 1972. Despite the complementary benefits of these two well known
methods, they have not been effectively combined to address local variations in
intensity. Many ad-hoc NCC frameworks, sub-optimal least squares methods and
image transformation approaches have thus been proposed instead, each with
their own limitations. This work shows that a least squares optimization of NCC
without approximation is not only possible, but straightforward and efficient.
A robust, locally normalized formulation is introduced to mitigate local
intensity variations and partial occlusions. Finally, sparse features with
oriented patches are proposed for further efficiency. The resulting framework
is simple to implement, computationally efficient and robust to local intensity
variations. It is evaluated on the image alignment problem, showing
improvements in both convergence rate and computation time over existing
lighting invariant methods.</span>

                                        <span>We tackle a challenging blind image denoising problem, in which only single
distinct noisy images are available for training a denoiser, and no information
about noise is known, except for it being zero-mean, additive, and independent
of the clean image. In such a setting, which often occurs in practice, it is
not possible to train a denoiser with the standard discriminative training or
with the recently developed Noise2Noise (N2N) training; the former requires the
underlying clean image for the given noisy image, and the latter requires two
independently realized noisy image pair for a clean image. To that end, we
propose GAN2GAN (Generated-Artificial-Noise to Generated-Artificial-Noise)
method that first learns a generative model that can 1) simulate the noise in
the given noisy images and 2) generate a rough, noisy estimates of the clean
images, then 3) iteratively trains a denoiser with subsequently synthesized
noisy image pairs (as in N2N), obtained from the generative model. In results,
we show the denoiser trained with our GAN2GAN achieves an impressive denoising
performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for the blind denoising
setting; it almost approaches the performance of the standard
discriminatively-trained or N2N-trained models that have more information than
ours, and it significantly outperforms the recent baseline for the same
setting, \textit{e.g.}, Noise2Void, and a more conventional yet strong one,
BM3D. The official code of our method is available at

                                        <span>We present an approach for encoding visual task relationships to improve
model performance in an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting. Semantic
segmentation and monocular depth estimation are shown to be complementary
tasks; in a multi-task learning setting, a proper encoding of their
relationships can further improve performance on both tasks. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a novel Cross-Task Relation Layer (CTRL), which encodes
task dependencies between the semantic and depth predictions. To capture the
cross-task relationships, we propose a neural network architecture that
contains task-specific and cross-task refinement heads. Furthermore, we propose
an Iterative Self-Learning (ISL) training scheme, which exploits semantic
pseudo-labels to provide extra supervision on the target domain. We
experimentally observe improvements in both tasks&#x27; performance because the
complementary information present in these tasks is better captured.
Specifically, we show that: (1) our approach improves performance on all tasks
when they are complementary and mutually dependent; (2) the CTRL helps to
improve both semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks performance in
the challenging UDA setting; (3) the proposed ISL training scheme further
improves the semantic segmentation performance. The implementation is available

matching an arbitrary, relatively unstructured, prior distribution for
sampling, we propose a sampling technique that relies solely on the
independence of latent variables, thereby avoiding the trade-off between
reconstruction quality and generative performance inherent to VAEs. We design a
novel autoencoder architecture capable of learning a structured representation
without the need for aggressive regularization. Our structural decoders learn a
hierarchy of latent variables, akin to structural causal models, thereby
ordering the information without any additional regularization. We demonstrate
how these models learn a representation that improves results in a variety of
downstream tasks including generation, disentanglement, and extrapolation using
several challenging and natural image datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Despite recent progress of automatic medical image segmentation techniques,
fully automatic results usually fail to meet the clinical use and typically
require further refinement. In this work, we propose a quality-aware memory
network for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images. Provided by user
guidance on an arbitrary slice, an interaction network is firstly employed to
obtain an initial 2D segmentation. The quality-aware memory network
subsequently propagates the initial segmentation estimation bidirectionally
over the entire volume. Subsequent refinement based on additional user guidance
on other slices can be incorporated in the same manner. To further facilitate
interactive segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest
the next slice to segment based on the current segmentation quality of each
slice. The proposed network has two appealing characteristics: 1) The
memory-augmented network offers the ability to quickly encode past segmentation
information, which will be retrieved for the segmentation of other slices; 2)
The quality assessment module enables the model to directly estimate the
qualities of segmentation predictions, which allows an active learning paradigm
where users preferentially label the lowest-quality slice for multi-round
refinement. The proposed network leads to a robust interactive segmentation
engine, which can generalize well to various types of user annotations (e.g.,
scribbles, boxes). Experimental results on various medical datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our approach in comparison with existing techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Person re-identification (Re-ID) via gait features within 3D skeleton
sequences is a newly-emerging topic with several advantages. Existing solutions
either rely on hand-crafted descriptors or supervised gait representation
learning. This paper proposes a self-supervised gait encoding approach that can
leverage unlabeled skeleton data to learn gait representations for person
Re-ID. Specifically, we first create self-supervision by learning to
reconstruct unlabeled skeleton sequences reversely, which involves richer
high-level semantics to obtain better gait representations. Other pretext tasks
are also explored to further improve self-supervised learning. Second, inspired
by the fact that motion&#x27;s continuity endows adjacent skeletons in one skeleton
sequence and temporally consecutive skeleton sequences with higher correlations
(referred as locality in 3D skeleton data), we propose a locality-aware
attention mechanism and a locality-aware contrastive learning scheme, which aim
to preserve locality-awareness on intra-sequence level and inter-sequence level
respectively during self-supervised learning. Last, with context vectors
learned by our locality-aware attention mechanism and contrastive learning
scheme, a novel feature named Constrastive Attention-based Gait Encodings
(CAGEs) is designed to represent gait effectively. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based counterparts by
15-40% Rank-1 accuracy, and it even achieves superior performance to numerous
multi-modal methods with extra RGB or depth information. Our codes are

                                        <span>How can neural networks trained by contrastive learning extract features from
the unlabeled data? Why does contrastive learning usually need much stronger
data augmentations than supervised learning to ensure good representations?
These questions involve both the optimization and statistical aspects of deep
learning, but can hardly be answered by analyzing supervised learning, where
the target functions are the highest pursuit. Indeed, in self-supervised
learning, it is inevitable to relate to the optimization/generalization of
neural networks to how they can encode the latent structures in the data, which
we refer to as the feature learning process.

In this work, we formally study how contrastive learning learns the feature
representations for neural networks by analyzing its feature learning process.
We consider the case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the
more semantically aligned sparse features which we want to learn from, and the
other dense features we want to avoid. Theoretically, we prove that contrastive
learning using $\mathbf{ReLU}$ networks provably learns the desired sparse
features if proper augmentations are adopted. We present an underlying
principle called $\textbf{feature decoupling}$ to explain the effects of
augmentations, where we theoretically characterize how augmentations can reduce
the correlations of dense features between positive samples while keeping the
correlations of sparse features intact, thereby forcing the neural networks to
learn from the self-supervision of sparse features. Empirically, we verified
that the feature decoupling principle matches the underlying mechanism of
contrastive learning in practice.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in self-supervised learning have experienced remarkable
progress, especially for contrastive learning based methods, which regard each
image as well as its augmentations as an individual class and try to
distinguish them from all other images. However, due to the large quantity of
exemplars, this kind of pretext task intrinsically suffers from slow
convergence and is hard for optimization. This is especially true for small
scale models, which we find the performance drops dramatically comparing with
its supervised counterpart. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective
distillation strategy for unsupervised learning. The highlight is that the
relationship among similar samples counts and can be seamlessly transferred to
the student to boost the performance. Our method, termed as BINGO, which is
short for \textbf{B}ag of \textbf{I}nsta\textbf{N}ces
a\textbf{G}gregati\textbf{O}n, targets at transferring the relationship learned
by the teacher to the student. Here bag of instances indicates a set of similar
samples constructed by the teacher and are grouped within a bag, and the goal
of distillation is to aggregate compact representations over the student with
respect to instances in a bag. Notably, BINGO achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on small scale models, \emph{i.e.}, 65.5% and 68.9% top-1
accuracies with linear evaluation on ImageNet, using ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 as
backbone, respectively, surpassing baselines (52.5% and 57.4% top-1 accuracies)
by a significant margin. The code will be available at

                                        <span>A fingerprint region of interest (roi) segmentation algorithm is designed to
separate the foreground fingerprint from the background noise. All the learning
based state-of-the-art fingerprint roi segmentation algorithms proposed in the
literature are benchmarked on scenarios when both training and testing
databases consist of fingerprint images acquired from the same sensors.
However, when testing is conducted on a different sensor, the segmentation
performance obtained is often unsatisfactory. As a result, every time a new
fingerprint sensor is used for testing, the fingerprint roi segmentation model
needs to be re-trained with the fingerprint image acquired from the new sensor
and its corresponding manually marked ROI. Manually marking fingerprint ROI is
expensive because firstly, it is time consuming and more importantly, requires
domain expertise. In order to save the human effort in generating annotations
required by state-of-the-art, we propose a fingerprint roi segmentation model
which aligns the features of fingerprint images derived from the unseen sensor
such that they are similar to the ones obtained from the fingerprints whose
ground truth roi masks are available for training. Specifically, we propose a
recurrent adversarial learning based feature alignment network that helps the
fingerprint roi segmentation model to learn sensor-invariant features.
Consequently, sensor-invariant features learnt by the proposed roi segmentation
model help it to achieve improved segmentation performance on fingerprints
acquired from the new sensor. Experiments on publicly available FVC databases
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed work.</span>

                                        <span>Interconnected road lanes are a central concept for navigating urban roads.
Currently, most autonomous vehicles rely on preconstructed lane maps as
designing an algorithmic model is difficult. However, the generation and
maintenance of such maps is costly and hinders large-scale adoption of
autonomous vehicle technology. This paper presents the first self-supervised
learning method to train a model to infer a spatially grounded lane-level road
network graph based on a dense segmented representation of the road scene
generated from onboard sensors. A formal road lane network model is presented
and proves that any structured road scene can be represented by a directed
acyclic graph of at most depth three while retaining the notion of intersection
regions, and that this is the most compressed representation. The formal model
is implemented by a hybrid neural and search-based model, utilizing a novel
barrier function loss formulation for robust learning from partial labels.
Experiments are conducted for all common road intersection layouts. Results
show that the model can generalize to new road layouts, unlike previous
approaches, demonstrating its potential for real-world application as a
practical learning-based lane-level map generator.</span>

                                        <span>Noninvasive optical imaging through dynamic scattering media has numerous
important biomedical applications but still remains a challenging task. While
standard methods aim to form images based upon optical absorption or
fluorescent emission, it is also well-established that the temporal correlation
of scattered coherent light diffuses through tissue much like optical
intensity. Few works to date, however, have aimed to experimentally measure and
process such data to demonstrate deep-tissue imaging of decorrelation dynamics.
In this work, we take advantage of a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array
camera, with over one thousand detectors, to simultaneously detect speckle
fluctuations at the single-photon level from 12 different phantom tissue
surface locations delivered via a customized fiber bundle array. We then apply
a deep neural network to convert the acquired single-photon measurements into
video of scattering dynamics beneath rapidly decorrelating liquid tissue
phantoms. We demonstrate the ability to record video of dynamic events
occurring 5-8 mm beneath a decorrelating tissue phantom with mm-scale
resolution and at a 2.5-10 Hz frame rate.</span>

                                        <span>Pulmonary vessel segmentation is important for clinical diagnosis of
pulmonary diseases, while is also challenging due to the complicated structure.
In this work, we present an effective framework and refinement process of
pulmonary vessel segmentation from chest computed tomographic (CT) images. The
key to our approach is a 2.5D segmentation network applied from three
orthogonal axes, which presents a robust and fully automated pulmonary vessel
segmentation result with lower network complexity and memory usage compared to
3D networks. The slice radius is introduced to convolve the adjacent
information of the center slice and the multi-planar fusion optimizes the
presentation of intra- and inter- slice features. Besides, the tree-like
structure of the pulmonary vessel is extracted in the post-processing process,
which is used for segmentation refining and pruning. In the evaluation
experiments, three fusion methods are tested and the most promising one is
compared with the state-of-the-art 2D and 3D structures on 300 cases of lung
images randomly selected from LIDC dataset. Our method outperforms other
network structures by a large margin and achieves by far the highest average
DICE score of 0.9272 and precision of 0.9310, as per our knowledge from the
pulmonary vessel segmentation models available in the literature.</span>

                                        <span>The effectiveness of fingerprint-based authentication systems on good quality
fingerprints is established long back. However, the performance of standard
fingerprint matching systems on noisy and poor quality fingerprints is far from
satisfactory. Towards this, we propose a data uncertainty-based framework which
enables the state-of-the-art fingerprint preprocessing models to quantify noise
present in the input image and identify fingerprint regions with background
noise and poor ridge clarity. Quantification of noise helps the model two
folds: firstly, it makes the objective function adaptive to the noise in a
particular input fingerprint and consequently, helps to achieve robust
performance on noisy and distorted fingerprint regions. Secondly, it provides a
noise variance map which indicates noisy pixels in the input fingerprint image.
The predicted noise variance map enables the end-users to understand erroneous
predictions due to noise present in the input image. Extensive experimental
evaluation on 13 publicly available fingerprint databases, across different
architectural choices and two fingerprint processing tasks demonstrate
effectiveness of the proposed framework.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a similarity-aware fusion network (SAFNet) to
adaptively fuse 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation.
Existing fusion-based methods achieve remarkable performances by integrating
information from multiple modalities. However, they heavily rely on the
correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points by projection and can only
perform the information fusion in a fixed manner, and thus their performances
cannot be easily migrated to a more realistic scenario where the collected data
often lack strict pair-wise features for prediction. To address this, we employ
a late fusion strategy where we first learn the geometric and contextual
similarities between the input and back-projected (from 2D pixels) point clouds
and utilize them to guide the fusion of two modalities to further exploit
complementary information. Specifically, we employ a geometric similarity
module (GSM) to directly compare the spatial coordinate distributions of
pair-wise 3D neighborhoods, and a contextual similarity module (CSM) to
aggregate and compare spatial contextual information of corresponding central
points. The two proposed modules can effectively measure how much image
features can help predictions, enabling the network to adaptively adjust the
contributions of two modalities to the final prediction of each point.
Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 benchmark demonstrate that SAFNet
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion-based approaches
across various data integrity.</span>

which disseminate among mammals and others cause sickness among humans.
COVID-19 is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading, rendering its early
diagnosis of preeminent status. Researchers, medical specialists and
organizations all over the globe have been working tirelessly to combat this
virus and help in its containment. In this paper, a novel neural network called
WisdomNet has been proposed, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-rays.
The WisdomNet uses the concept of Wisdom of Crowds as its founding idea. It is
a two-layered convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes chest x-ray
images as input. Both layers of the proposed neural network consist of a number
of neural networks each. The dataset used for this study consists of chest
x-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients, compiled and shared by Dr. Cohen on
GitHub, and the chest x-ray images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by viral
and bacterial pneumonia were obtained from Kaggle. The network not only
pinpoints the presence of COVID-19, but also gives the probability of the
disease maturing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus,
predicting the progression of the disease in the COVID-19 positive patients.
The network also slender the occurrences of false negative cases by employing a
high threshold value, thus aids in curbing the spread of the disease and gives
an accuracy of 100% for successfully predicting COVID-19 among the chest x-rays
of patients affected with COVID-19, bacterial and viral pneumonia.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) model that learns how to
cluster a set of images into an unknown number of identities using a training
set of images annotated with labels belonging to a disjoint set of identities.
Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components
predicted at each level of the hierarchy to form a new graph at the next level.
Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and
complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The
resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score
and 8% increase in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) relative to current
GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based
methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node
densities as intermediate steps of the clustering process. In contrast, our
unified framework achieves a seven-fold decrease in computational cost. We

                                        <span>Acquiring annotated data at scale with rare diseases or conditions remains a
challenge. It would be extremely useful to have a method that controllably
synthesizes images that can correct such underrepresentation. Assuming a proper
latent representation, the idea of a &quot;latent vector arithmetic&quot; could offer the
means of achieving such synthesis. A proper representation must encode the
fidelity of the input data, preserve invariance and equivariance, and permit
arithmetic operations. Motivated by the ability to disentangle images into
spatial anatomy (tensor) factors and accompanying imaging (vector)
representations, we propose a framework termed &quot;disentangled anatomy
arithmetic&quot;, in which a generative model learns to combine anatomical factors
of different input images such that when they are re-entangled with the desired
imaging modality (e.g. MRI), plausible new cardiac images are created with the
target characteristics. To encourage a realistic combination of anatomy factors
after the arithmetic step, we propose a localized noise injection network that
precedes the generator. Our model is used to generate realistic images,
pathology labels, and segmentation masks that are used to augment the existing
datasets and subsequently improve post-hoc classification and segmentation
tasks. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/vios-s/DAA-GAN.</span>

segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance
Imaging), providing clinical measurements.In practice, two questions arise with
deployment of CNNs: 1) when is it better to use a shallow model instead of a
deeper one? 2) how the size of a dataset might change the network performance?
We propose a framework to answer them, by experimenting with deep and shallow
versions of three U-Net families, trained from scratch in six subsets varying
from 100 to 10,000 images, different network sizes, learning rates and
regularization values. 1620 models were evaluated using 5-foldcross-validation
by loss and DICE. The results indicate that: sample size affects performance
more than architecture or hyper-parameters; in small samples the performance is
more sensitive to hyper-parameters than architecture; the performance
difference between shallow and deeper networks is not the same across families.</span>

introduction of ConvNets. However, on very constrained hardware the time
necessary to train such models would be high. Our main contribution is twofold.
First, we extensively test an end-to-end vanilla neural network (MLP) approach
in pure numpy without any pre-processing or feature extraction done beforehand.
Second, we show that basic data mining operations can significantly improve the
performance of the models in terms of computational time, without sacrificing
much accuracy. We illustrate our claims on a simpler variant of the Extended
MNIST dataset, called Balanced EMNIST dataset. Our experiments show that,
without any data mining, we get increased generalization performance when using
more hidden layers and regularization techniques, the best model achieving
84.83% accuracy on a test dataset. Using dimensionality reduction done by PCA
we were able to increase that figure to 85.08% with only 10% of the original
feature space, reducing the memory size needed by 64%. Finally, adding methods
to remove possibly harmful training samples like deviation from the mean helped
us to still achieve over 84% test accuracy but with only 32.8% of the original
memory size for the training set. This compares favorably to the majority of
literature results obtained through similar architectures. Although this
approach gets outshined by state-of-the-art models, it does scale to some
(AlexNet, VGGNet) trained on 50% of the same dataset.</span>

We capture input data as an image and train a model to produce the subsequent
image. This approach results in predicting distributions as opposed to
pointwise values. To assess the robustness and quality of our approach, we
examine various datasets and multiple evaluation metrics. Our experiments show
that our forecasting tool is effective for cyclic data but somewhat less for
irregular data such as stock prices. Importantly, when using image-based
evaluation metrics, we find our method to outperform various baselines,
including ARIMA, and a numerical variation of our deep learning approach.</span>

especially UAVs. In this paper, we detect the flying drone using a fisheye
camera. In the field of diagnosis and classification of objects, there are
always many problems that prevent the development of rapid and significant
progress in this area. During the previous decades, a couple of advanced
classification methods such as convolutional neural networks and support vector
machines have been developed. In this study, the drone was detected using three
methods of classification of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector
machine (SVM), and nearest neighbor. The outcomes show that CNN, SVM, and
nearest neighbor have total accuracy of 95%, 88%, and 80%, respectively.
Compared with other classifiers with the same experimental conditions, the
accuracy of the convolutional neural network classifier is satisfactory.</span>

rationale, given a question-image input. VCR is a recently introduced visual
scene understanding task with a wide range of applications, including visual
question answering, automated vehicle systems, and clinical decision support.
Previous approaches to solving the VCR task generally rely on pre-training or
exploiting memory with long dependency relationship encoded models. However,
these approaches suffer from a lack of generalizability and prior knowledge. In
this paper we propose a dynamic working memory based cognitive VCR network,
which stores accumulated commonsense between sentences to provide prior
knowledge for inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model
yields significant improvements over existing methods on the benchmark VCR
dataset. Moreover, the proposed model provides intuitive interpretation into
visual commonsense reasoning. A Python implementation of our mechanism is

                                        <span>Single-pixel imaging is a novel imaging scheme that has gained popularity due
to its huge computational gain and potential for a low-cost alternative to
imaging beyond the visible spectrum. The traditional reconstruction methods
struggle to produce a clear recovery when one limits the number of illumination
patterns from a spatial light modulator. As a remedy, several
deep-learning-based solutions have been proposed which lack good generalization
ability due to the architectural setup and loss functions. In this paper, we
propose a generative adversarial network-based reconstruction framework for
single-pixel imaging, referred to as SPI-GAN. Our method can reconstruct images
with 17.92 dB PSNR and 0.487 SSIM, even if the sampling ratio drops to 5%. This
facilitates much faster reconstruction making our method suitable for
single-pixel video. Furthermore, our ResNet-like architecture for the generator
leads to useful representation learning that allows us to reconstruct
completely unseen objects. The experimental results demonstrate that SPI-GAN
achieves significant performance gain, e.g. near 3dB PSNR gain, over the
current state-of-the-art method.</span>

from datasets whose size is too limited to allow generalisation beyond the
training set. To address the challenge we propose to use a transfer learning
approach whereby the model is first trained on a synthetic dataset replicating
features of the original objects. In this study the objects were smartphone
photographs of near-complete Roman terra sigillata pottery vessels from the
collection of the Museum of London. Taking the replicated features from
published profile drawings of pottery forms allowed the integration of expert
knowledge into the process through our synthetic data generator. After this
first initial training the model was fine-tuned with data from photographs of
real vessels. We show, through exhaustive experiments across several popular
deep learning architectures, different test priors, and considering the impact
of the photograph viewpoint and excessive damage to the vessels, that the
proposed hybrid approach enables the creation of classifiers with appropriate
generalisation performance. This performance is significantly better than that
of classifiers trained exclusively on the original data which shows the promise
of the approach to alleviate the fundamental issue of learning from small
datasets.</span>

infection that has had devastating effects on the world. Recently, new COVID-19
variants are emerging making the situation more challenging and threatening.
Evaluation and quantification of COVID-19 lung abnormalities based on chest
Computed Tomography (CT) scans can help determining the disease stage,
efficiently allocating limited healthcare resources, and making informed
treatment decisions. During pandemic era, however, visual assessment and
quantification of COVID-19 lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive
and prone to error, which raises an urgent quest to develop practical
autonomous solutions. In this context, first, the paper introduces an open
access COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset containing 433 CT images from 82
patients that have been annotated by an expert radiologist. Second, a Deep
Neural Network (DNN)-based framework is proposed, referred to as the
COVID-Rate, that autonomously segments lung abnormalities associated with
COVID-19 from chest CT scans. Performance of the proposed COVID-Rate framework
is evaluated through several experiments based on the introduced and external
datasets. The results show a dice score of 0:802 and specificity and
sensitivity of 0:997 and 0:832, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate
that the COVID-Rate model can efficiently segment COVID-19 lesions in both 2D
CT images and whole lung volumes. Results on the external dataset illustrate
generalization capabilities of the COVID-Rate model to CT images obtained from
a different scanner.</span>

                                        <span>Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an emerging topic with great
potential in security-critical applications. Existing methods typically learn
body and motion features from the body-joint trajectory, whereas they lack a
systematic way to model body structure and underlying relations of body
components beyond the scale of body joints. In this paper, we for the first
time propose a Self-supervised Multi-scale Skeleton Graph Encoding (SM-SGE)
framework that comprehensively models human body, component relations, and
skeleton dynamics from unlabeled skeleton graphs of various scales to learn an
effective skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Specifically, we first
devise multi-scale skeleton graphs with coarse-to-fine human body partitions,
which enables us to model body structure and skeleton dynamics at multiple
levels. Second, to mine inherent correlations between body components in
skeletal motion, we propose a multi-scale graph relation network to learn
structural relations between adjacent body-component nodes and collaborative
relations among nodes of different scales, so as to capture more discriminative
skeleton graph features. Last, we propose a novel multi-scale skeleton
reconstruction mechanism to enable our framework to encode skeleton dynamics
and high-level semantics from unlabeled skeleton graphs, which encourages
learning a discriminative skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Extensive
experiments show that SM-SGE outperforms most state-of-the-art skeleton-based
methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on 3D skeleton data estimated
from large-scale RGB videos. Our codes are open at

                                        <span>RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) recently has attracted increasing
research interest by benefiting conventional RGB SOD with extra depth
information. However, existing RGB-D SOD models often fail to perform well in
terms of both efficiency and accuracy, which hinders their potential
applications on mobile devices and real-world problems. An underlying challenge
is that the model accuracy usually degrades when the model is simplified to
have few parameters. To tackle this dilemma and also inspired by the fact that
depth quality is a key factor influencing the accuracy, we propose a novel
depth quality-inspired feature manipulation (DQFM) process, which is efficient
itself and can serve as a gating mechanism for filtering depth features to
greatly boost the accuracy. DQFM resorts to the alignment of low-level RGB and
depth features, as well as holistic attention of the depth stream to explicitly
control and enhance cross-modal fusion. We embed DQFM to obtain an efficient
light-weight model called DFM-Net, where we also design a tailored depth
backbone and a two-stage decoder for further efficiency consideration.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DFM-Net achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy when comparing to existing non-efficient models, and
meanwhile runs at 140ms on CPU (2.2$\times$ faster than the prior fastest
efficient model) with only $\sim$8.5Mb model size (14.9% of the prior
lightest). Our code will be made publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we present Generic Object Detection (GenOD), one of the
largest object detection systems deployed to a web-scale general visual search
engine that can detect over 900 categories for all Microsoft Bing Visual Search
queries in near real-time. It acts as a fundamental visual query understanding
service that provides object-centric information and shows gains in multiple
production scenarios, improving upon domain-specific models. We discuss the
challenges of collecting data, training, deploying and updating such a
large-scale object detection model with multiple dependencies. We discuss a
data collection pipeline that reduces per-bounding box labeling cost by 81.5%
and latency by 61.2% while improving on annotation quality. We show that GenOD
can improve weighted average precision by over 20% compared to multiple
domain-specific models. We also improve the model update agility by nearly 2
times with the proposed disjoint detector training compared to joint
fine-tuning. Finally we demonstrate how GenOD benefits visual search
applications by significantly improving object-level search relevance by 54.9%
and user engagement by 59.9%.</span>

                                        <span>This paper is responding to the MIA-COV19 challenge to classify COVID from
non-COVID based on CT lung images. The COVID-19 virus has devastated the world
in the last eighteen months by infecting more than 182 million people and
causing over 3.9 million deaths. The overarching aim is to predict the
diagnosis of the COVID-19 virus from chest radiographs, through the development
of explainable vision transformer deep learning techniques, leading to
population screening in a more rapid, accurate and transparent way. In this
competition, there are 5381 three-dimensional (3D) datasets in total, including
1552 for training, 374 for evaluation and 3455 for testing. While most of the
data volumes are in axial view, there are a number of subjects&#x27; data are in
coronal or sagittal views with 1 or 2 slices are in axial view. Hence, while 3D
data based classification is investigated, in this competition, 2D images
remains the main focus. Two deep learning methods are studied, which are vision
transformer (ViT) based on attention models and DenseNet that is built upon
conventional convolutional neural network (CNN). Initial evaluation results
based on validation datasets whereby the ground truth is known indicate that
ViT performs better than DenseNet with F1 scores being 0.76 and 0.72
respectively. Codes are available at GitHub at

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples. Adversarial examples are malicious images with visually imperceptible
perturbations. While these carefully crafted perturbations restricted with
tight $\Lp$ norm bounds are small, they are still easily perceivable by humans.
These perturbations also have limited success rates when attacking black-box
models or models with defenses like noise reduction filters. To solve these
problems, we propose Demiguise Attack, crafting &#x60;&#x60;unrestricted&#x27;&#x27; perturbations
with Perceptual Similarity. Specifically, we can create powerful and
photorealistic adversarial examples by manipulating semantic information based
on Perceptual Similarity. Adversarial examples we generate are friendly to the
human visual system (HVS), although the perturbations are of large magnitudes.
We extend widely-used attacks with our approach, enhancing adversarial
effectiveness impressively while contributing to imperceptibility. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed method not only outperforms various
state-of-the-art attacks in terms of fooling rate, transferability, and
robustness against defenses but can also improve attacks effectively. In
addition, we also notice that our implementation can simulate illumination and
contrast changes that occur in real-world scenarios, which will contribute to
exposing the blind spots of DNNs.</span>

that outperform any other classification technique. However, success of any
empirical system depends on the quality and diversity of the data available to
train the proposed system. In this research, we have carefully accumulated a
relatively challenging dataset that contains images collected from various
sources for three different disasters: fire, water and land. Besides this, we
have also collected images for various damaged infrastructure due to natural or
man made calamities and damaged human due to war or accidents. We have also
accumulated image data for a class named non-damage that contains images with
no such disaster or sign of damage in them. There are 13,720 manually annotated
images in this dataset, each image is annotated by three individuals. We are
also providing discriminating image class information annotated manually with
bounding box for a set of 200 test images. Images are collected from different
news portals, social media, and standard datasets made available by other
researchers. A three layer attention model (TLAM) is trained and average five
fold validation accuracy of 95.88% is achieved. Moreover, on the 200 unseen
test images this accuracy is 96.48%. We also generate and compare attention
maps for these test images to determine the characteristics of the trained
attention model. Our dataset is available at

                                        <span>Traditional crowd counting approaches usually use Gaussian assumption to
generate pseudo density ground truth, which suffers from problems like
inaccurate estimation of the Gaussian kernel sizes. In this paper, we propose a
new measure-based counting approach to regress the predicted density maps to
the scattered point-annotated ground truth directly. First, crowd counting is
formulated as a measure matching problem. Second, we derive a semi-balanced
form of Sinkhorn divergence, based on which a Sinkhorn counting loss is
designed for measure matching. Third, we propose a self-supervised mechanism by
devising a Sinkhorn scale consistency loss to resist scale changes. Finally, an
efficient optimization method is provided to minimize the overall loss
function. Extensive experiments on four challenging crowd counting datasets
namely ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU++, and NWPU have validated the proposed
method.</span>

capturing CT images with non-standardized protocols causes low reproducibility
regarding radiomic features, forming a barrier on CT image analysis in a large

by using non-standard reconstruction kernels. RadiomicGAN consists of hybrid
neural blocks including both pre-trained and trainable layers adopted to learn
radiomic feature distributions efficiently. A novel training approach, called

                                        <span>With the increasing demand for search and rescue, it is highly demanded to
detect objects of interest in large-scale images captured by Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), which is quite challenging due to extremely small scales of
objects. Most existing methods employed Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enrich
shallow layers&#x27; features by combing deep layers&#x27; contextual features. However,
under the limitation of the inconsistency in gradient computation across
different layers, the shallow layers in FPN are not fully exploited to detect
tiny objects. In this paper, we propose a Scale Selection Pyramid network
(SSPNet) for tiny person detection, which consists of three components: Context
Attention Module (CAM), Scale Enhancement Module (SEM), and Scale Selection
Module (SSM). CAM takes account of context information to produce hierarchical
attention heatmaps. SEM highlights features of specific scales at different
layers, leading the detector to focus on objects of specific scales instead of
vast backgrounds. SSM exploits adjacent layers&#x27; relationships to fulfill
suitable feature sharing between deep layers and shallow layers, thereby
avoiding the inconsistency in gradient computation across different layers.
Besides, we propose a Weighted Negative Sampling (WNS) strategy to guide the
detector to select more representative samples. Experiments on the TinyPerson
benchmark show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detectors.</span>

Previous works usually utilize RGB images or LiDAR point clouds to identify and
localize multiple objects in self-driving. However, cameras tend to fail in bad
driving conditions, e.g. bad weather or weak lighting, while LiDAR scanners are
too expensive to get widely deployed in commercial applications. Radar has been
drawing more and more attention due to its robustness and low cost. In this
paper, we propose a scene-aware radar learning framework for accurate and
robust object detection. First, the learning framework contains branches
conditioning on the scene category of the radar sequence; with each branch
optimized for a specific type of scene. Second, three different 3D
autoencoder-based architectures are proposed for radar object detection and
ensemble learning is performed over the different architectures to further
boost the final performance. Third, we propose novel scene-aware sequence mix
augmentation (SceneMix) and scene-specific post-processing to generate more
robust detection results. In the ROD2021 Challenge, we achieved a final result
of average precision of 75.0% and an average recall of 81.0%. Moreover, in the
parking lot scene, our framework ranks first with an average precision of 97.8%
and an average recall of 98.6%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our
framework.</span>

                                        <span>Deep image colorization networks often suffer from the color-bleeding
artifact, a problematic color spreading near the boundaries between adjacent
objects. The color-bleeding artifacts debase the reality of generated outputs,
limiting the applicability of colorization models on a practical application.
Although previous approaches have tackled this problem in an automatic manner,
they often generate imperfect outputs because their enhancements are available
only in limited cases, such as having a high contrast of gray-scale value in an
input image. Instead, leveraging user interactions would be a promising
approach, since it can help the edge correction in the desired regions. In this
paper, we propose a novel edge-enhancing framework for the regions of interest,
by utilizing user scribbles that indicate where to enhance. Our method requires
minimal user effort to obtain satisfactory enhancements. Experimental results
on various datasets demonstrate that our interactive approach has outstanding
performance in improving color-bleeding artifacts against the existing
baselines.</span>

                                        <span>The precise detection of blood vessels in retinal images is crucial to the
early diagnosis of the retinal vascular diseases, e.g., diabetic, hypertensive
and solar retinopathies. Existing works often fail in predicting the abnormal
areas, e.g, sudden brighter and darker areas and are inclined to predict a
pixel to background due to the significant class imbalance, leading to high
accuracy and specificity while low sensitivity. To that end, we propose a novel
error attention refining network (ERA-Net) that is capable of learning and
predicting the potential false predictions in a two-stage manner for effective
retinal vessel segmentation. The proposed ERA-Net in the refine stage drives
the model to focus on and refine the segmentation errors produced in the
initial training stage. To achieve this, unlike most previous attention
approaches that run in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a novel error
attention mechanism which considers the differences between the ground truth
and the initial segmentation masks as the ground truth to supervise the
attention map learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on two common retinal blood vessel
datasets.</span>

topic in the field of pattern recognition. In previous studies, text detection
and recognition are separated, which leads to the fact that text recognition is

modelling, which can be optimized directly on the maximum likelihood of the
dataset. They also allow computation of the exact latent vector corresponding
to an image since they are composed of invertible transformations. However, the
requirement of invertibility of the transformation prevents standard and
expressive neural network models such as CNNs from being directly used.
Emergent convolutions were proposed to construct an invertible 3$\times$3 CNN
layer using a pair of masked CNN layers, making them inefficient. We study
conditions such that 3$\times$3 CNNs are invertible, allowing them to construct
expressive normalizing flows. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on
a padded CNN for it to be invertible. Our conditions for invertibility are
simple, can easily be maintained during the training process. Since we require
only a single CNN layer for every effective invertible CNN layer, our approach
is more efficient than emerging convolutions. We also proposed a coupling
method, Quad-coupling. We benchmark our approach and show similar performance
results to emergent convolutions while improving the model&#x27;s efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Continual learning has been a major problem in the deep learning community,
where the main challenge is how to effectively learn a series of newly arriving
tasks without forgetting the knowledge of previous tasks. Initiated by Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), many of the existing works report that knowledge
distillation is effective to preserve the previous knowledge, and hence they
commonly use a soft label for the old task, namely a knowledge distillation
(KD) loss, together with a class label for the new task, namely a cross entropy
(CE) loss, to form a composite loss for a single neural network. However, this
approach suffers from learning the knowledge by a CE loss as a KD loss often
more strongly influences the objective function when they are in a competitive
situation within a single network. This could be a critical problem
particularly in a class incremental scenario, where the knowledge across tasks
as well as within the new task, both of which can only be acquired by a CE
loss, is essentially learned due to the existence of a unified classifier. In
this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method, called
Split-and-Bridge, which can successfully address the above problem by partially
splitting a neural network into two partitions for training the new task
separated from the old task and re-connecting them for learning the knowledge
across tasks. In our thorough experimental analysis, our Split-and-Bridge
method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in KD-based continual
learning.</span>

Benefit from the self-attention module, transformer architectures have shown
extraordinary performance on many computer vision tasks. Although the network
performance is boosted, transformers are often required more computational
resources including memory usage and the inference complexity. Compared with
the existing knowledge distillation approaches, we propose to excavate useful
information from the teacher transformer through the relationship between
images and the divided patches. We then explore an efficient fine-grained
manifold distillation approach that simultaneously calculates cross-images,
cross-patch, and random-selected manifolds in teacher and student models.
Experimental results conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed algorithm for distilling portable transformer
models with higher performance. For example, our approach achieves 75.06% Top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet-1k dataset for training a DeiT-Tiny model, which
outperforms other ViT distillation methods.</span>

rate (CTR) prediction has draw lots of attentions from both industry and
academia field. Recently, the deep learning has become the mainstream
methodological choice for CTR. Despite of sustainable efforts have been made,
existing approaches still pose several challenges. On the one hand, high-order
interaction between the features is under-explored. On the other hand,
high-order interactions may neglect the semantic information from the low-order
fields. In this paper, we proposed a novel prediction method, named FINT, that
employs the Field-aware INTeraction layer which captures high-order feature
interactions while retaining the low-order field information. To empirically
investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the FINT, we perform extensive
experiments on the three realistic databases: KDD2012, Criteo and Avazu. The
obtained results demonstrate that the FINT can significantly improve the
performance compared to the existing methods, without increasing the amount of
computation required. Moreover, the proposed method brought about 2.72\%
increase to the advertising revenue of a big online video app through A/B
testing. To better promote the research in CTR field, we will release our code
as well as reference implementation of those baseline models in the final
version.</span>

could benefit various downstream applications such as question answering and
recommender systems. Participants are invited to complete the knowledge graph
by predicting missing triplets. Recent representation learning methods have
achieved great success on standard datasets like FB15k-237. Thus, we train the
advanced algorithms in different domains to learn the triplets, including OTE,
QuatE, RotatE and TransE. Significantly, we modified OTE into NOTE (short for
Norm-OTE) for better performance. Besides, we use both the DeepWalk and the
post-smoothing technique to capture the graph structure for supplementation. In
addition to the representations, we also use various statistical probabilities
among the head entities, the relations and the tail entities for the final
prediction. Experimental results show that the ensemble of state-of-the-art
representation learning methods could draw on each others strengths. And we
develop feature engineering from validation candidates for further
improvements. Please note that we apply the same strategy on the test set for
final inference. And these features may not be practical in the real world when
considering ranking against all the entities.</span>

                                        <span>Modelling mix-and-match relationships among fashion items has become
increasingly demanding yet challenging for modern E-commerce recommender
systems. When performing clothes matching, most existing approaches leverage
the latent visual features extracted from fashion item images for compatibility
modelling, which lacks explainability of generated matching results and can
hardly convince users of the recommendations. Though recent methods start to
incorporate pre-defined attribute information (e.g., colour, style, length,
etc.) for learning item representations and improving the model
interpretability, their utilisation of attribute information is still mainly
reserved for enhancing the learned item representations and generating
explanations via post-processing. As a result, this creates a severe bottleneck
when we are trying to advance the recommendation accuracy and generating
fine-grained explanations since the explicit attributes have only loose
connections to the actual recommendation process. This work aims to tackle the
explainability challenge in fashion recommendation tasks by proposing a novel
Attribute-aware Fashion Recommender (AFRec). Specifically, AFRec recommender
assesses the outfit compatibility by explicitly leveraging the extracted
attribute-level representations from each item&#x27;s visual feature. The attributes
serve as the bridge between two fashion items, where we quantify the affinity
of a pair of items through the learned compatibility between their attributes.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that, by making full use of the
explicit attributes in the recommendation process, AFRec is able to achieve
state-of-the-art recommendation accuracy and generate intuitive explanations at
the same time.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems (RSs) have emerged as very useful tools to help customers
with their decision-making process, find items of their interest, and alleviate
the information overload problem. There are two different lines of approaches
in RSs: (1) general recommenders with the main goal of discovering long-term
users&#x27; preferences, and (2) sequential recommenders with the main focus of
capturing short-term users&#x27; preferences in a session of user-item interaction
(here, a session refers to a record of purchasing multiple items in one
shopping event). While considering short-term users&#x27; preferences may satisfy
their current needs and interests, long-term users&#x27; preferences provide users
with the items that they may interact with, eventually. In this thesis, we
first focus on improving the performance of general RSs. Most of the existing
general RSs tend to exploit the users&#x27; rating patterns on common items to
detect similar users. The data sparsity problem (i.e. the lack of available
information) is one of the major challenges for the current general RSs, and
they may fail to have any recommendations when there are no common items of
interest among users. We call this problem data sparsity with no feedback on
common items (DSW-n-FCI). To overcome this problem, we propose a
personality-based RS in which similar users are identified based on the
similarity of their personality traits.</span>

Existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate and
aggregate information from neighboring nodes i.e., local message passing. Such
graph-based architectures have representational limits, as a single sub-graph
is susceptible to overfit the sequential dependencies instead of accounting for
complex transitions between items in different sessions. We propose using a

discovery in parallel coordinates. The concepts of hypercubes and hyper-blocks
are used as easily understandable by end-users in the visual form in parallel
coordinates. The Hyper algorithm for classification with mixed and pure
hyper-blocks (HBs) is proposed to discover hyper-blocks interactively and
automatically in individual, multiple, overlapping, and non-overlapping
setting. The combination of hyper-blocks with linguistic description of visual
patterns is presented too. It is shown that Hyper models generalize decision
trees. The Hyper algorithm was tested on the benchmark data from UCI ML
repository. It allowed discovering pure and mixed HBs with all data and then
with 10-fold cross validation. The links between hyper-blocks, dimension
reduction and visualization are established. Major benefits of hyper-block
technology and the Hyper algorithm are in their ability to discover and observe
hyper-blocks by end-users including side by side visualizations making patterns
visible for all classes. Another advantage of sets of HBs relative to the
decision trees is the ability to avoid both data overgeneralization and
overfitting.</span>

                                        <span>An issue documents discussions around required changes in issue-tracking
systems, while a commit contains the change itself in the version control
systems. Recovering links between issues and commits can facilitate many
software evolution tasks such as bug localization, and software documentation.
A previous study on over half a million issues from GitHub reports only about
42.2% of issues are manually linked by developers to their pertinent commits.
Automating the linking of commit-issue pairs can contribute to the improvement
of the said tasks. By far, current state-of-the-art approaches for automated
commit-issue linking suffer from low precision, leading to unreliable results,
sometimes to the point that imposes human supervision on the predicted links.
The low performance gets even more severe when there is a lack of textual
information in either commits or issues. Current approaches are also proven
computationally expensive.

We propose Hybrid-Linker to overcome such limitations by exploiting two
information channels; (1) a non-textual-based component that operates on
non-textual, automatically recorded information of the commit-issue pairs to
predict a link, and (2) a textual-based one which does the same using textual
information of the commit-issue pairs. Then, combining the results from the two
classifiers, Hybrid-Linker makes the final prediction. Thus, every time one
component falls short in predicting a link, the other component fills the gap
and improves the results. We evaluate Hybrid-Linker against competing
approaches, namely FRLink and DeepLink on a dataset of 12 projects.
Hybrid-Linker achieves 90.1%, 87.8%, and 88.9% based on recall, precision, and
F-measure, respectively. It also outperforms FRLink and DeepLink by 31.3%, and
41.3%, regarding the F-measure. Moreover, Hybrid-Linker exhibits extensive
improvements in terms of performance as well.</span>

efficient models for various computer vision applications such as
classification, segmentation, and detection. However, learning highly accurate
models relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Due to
this, model performance drops drastically when evaluated on label-scarce
datasets having visually distinct images, termed as domain adaptation problem.
There is a plethora of works to adapt classification and segmentation models to
label-scarce target datasets through unsupervised domain adaptation.
Considering that detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, many
recent works have focused on developing novel domain adaptive detection
techniques. Here, we describe in detail the domain adaptation problem for
detection and present an extensive survey of the various methods. Furthermore,
we highlight strategies proposed and the associated shortcomings. Subsequently,
we identify multiple aspects of the problem that are most promising for future
research. We believe that this survey shall be valuable to the pattern
recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, biometrics,
medical imaging, and autonomous navigation by introducing them to the problem,
and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing
promising directions for future research.</span>

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are a class of powerful machine
learning techniques, where both a generative and discriminative model are
trained simultaneously. GANs have been used, for example, to successfully
generate &quot;deep fake&quot; images. A recent trend in malware research consists of
treating executables as images and employing image-based analysis techniques.
In this research, we generate fake malware images using auxiliary classifier
GANs (AC-GAN), and we consider the effectiveness of various techniques for
classifying the resulting images. Our results indicate that the resulting
multiclass classification problem is challenging, yet we can obtain strong
results when restricting the problem to distinguishing between real and fake
samples. While the AC-GAN generated images often appear to be very similar to
real malware images, we conclude that from a deep learning perspective, the
AC-GAN generated samples do not rise to the level of deep fake malware images.</span>

outliers that may be corrupted. We model this by introducing the notion of
robust regret, which measures the regret only on rounds that are not outliers.
The aim for the learner is to achieve small robust regret, without knowing
where the outliers are. If the outliers are chosen adversarially, we show that
a simple filtering strategy on extreme gradients incurs O(k) additive overhead
compared to the usual regret bounds, and that this is unimprovable, which means
that k needs to be sublinear in the number of rounds. We further ask which
additional assumptions would allow for a linear number of outliers. It turns
out that the usual benign cases of independently, identically distributed
(i.i.d.) observations or strongly convex losses are not sufficient. However,
combining i.i.d. observations with the assumption that outliers are those
observations that are in an extreme quantile of the distribution, does lead to
sublinear robust regret, even though the expected number of outliers is linear.</span>

descent methods in stochastic variational inequalities, a class of optimization
problems with important applications to learning theory and machine learning.
Our analysis reveals an intricate relation between the algorithm&#x27;s rate of
convergence and the local geometry induced by the method&#x27;s underlying Bregman
function. We quantify this relation by means of the Legendre exponent, a notion
that we introduce to measure the growth rate of the Bregman divergence relative
to the ambient norm near a solution. We show that this exponent determines both
the optimal step-size policy of the algorithm and the optimal rates attained,
explaining in this way the differences observed for some popular Bregman
functions (Euclidean projection, negative entropy, fractional power, etc.).</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation has been widely used to compress existing deep
learning models while preserving the performance on a wide range of
applications. In the specific context of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
distillation from ensembles of acoustic models has recently shown promising
results in increasing recognition performance. In this paper, we propose an
extension of multi-teacher distillation methods to joint CTC-attention
end-to-end ASR systems. We also introduce three novel distillation strategies.
The core intuition behind them is to integrate the error rate metric to the
teacher selection rather than solely focusing on the observed losses. In this
way, we directly distill and optimize the student toward the relevant metric
for speech recognition. We evaluate these strategies under a selection of
training procedures on different datasets (TIMIT, Librispeech, Common Voice)
and various languages (English, French, Italian). In particular,
state-of-the-art error rates are reported on the Common Voice French, Italian
and TIMIT datasets.</span>

depth measurements by leveraging synthetic data to learn the association of
sparse point clouds with dense natural shapes, and using the image as evidence
to validate the predicted depth map. Our learned prior for natural shapes uses
only sparse depth as input, not images, so the method is not affected by the
covariate shift when attempting to transfer learned models from synthetic data
to real ones. This allows us to use abundant synthetic data with ground truth
to learn the most difficult component of the reconstruction process, which is
topology estimation, and use the image to refine the prediction based on
photometric evidence. Our approach uses fewer parameters than previous methods,
yet, achieves the state of the art on both indoor and outdoor benchmark

                                        <span>We tackle a challenging blind image denoising problem, in which only single
distinct noisy images are available for training a denoiser, and no information
about noise is known, except for it being zero-mean, additive, and independent
of the clean image. In such a setting, which often occurs in practice, it is
not possible to train a denoiser with the standard discriminative training or
with the recently developed Noise2Noise (N2N) training; the former requires the
underlying clean image for the given noisy image, and the latter requires two
independently realized noisy image pair for a clean image. To that end, we
propose GAN2GAN (Generated-Artificial-Noise to Generated-Artificial-Noise)
method that first learns a generative model that can 1) simulate the noise in
the given noisy images and 2) generate a rough, noisy estimates of the clean
images, then 3) iteratively trains a denoiser with subsequently synthesized
noisy image pairs (as in N2N), obtained from the generative model. In results,
we show the denoiser trained with our GAN2GAN achieves an impressive denoising
performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for the blind denoising
setting; it almost approaches the performance of the standard
discriminatively-trained or N2N-trained models that have more information than
ours, and it significantly outperforms the recent baseline for the same
setting, \textit{e.g.}, Noise2Void, and a more conventional yet strong one,
BM3D. The official code of our method is available at

minimization in online learning with exp-concave losses. We show that whenever
improper learning is allowed, a Strongly Adaptive online learner achieves the
dynamic regret of $\tilde O^*(n^{1/3}C_n^{2/3} \vee 1)$ where $C_n$ is the
total variation (a.k.a. path length) of the an arbitrary sequence of
comparators that may not be known to the learner ahead of time. Achieving this
rate was highly nontrivial even for squared losses in 1D where the best known
upper bound was $O(\sqrt{nC_n} \vee \log n)$ (Yuan and Lamperski, 2019). Our
new proof techniques make elegant use of the intricate structures of the primal
and dual variables imposed by the KKT conditions and could be of independent
interest. Finally, we apply our results to the classical statistical problem of
locally adaptive non-parametric regression (Mammen, 1991; Donoho and Johnstone,

learning method to train a model to infer a spatially grounded lane-level road
network graph based on a dense segmented representation of the road scene
generated from onboard sensors. A formal road lane network model is presented
and proves that any structured road scene can be represented by a directed
acyclic graph of at most depth three while retaining the notion of intersection
regions, and that this is the most compressed representation. The formal model
is implemented by a hybrid neural and search-based model, utilizing a novel
barrier function loss formulation for robust learning from partial labels.
Experiments are conducted for all common road intersection layouts. Results
show that the model can generalize to new road layouts, unlike previous
approaches, demonstrating its potential for real-world application as a
practical learning-based lane-level map generator.</span>

                                        <span>Dynamic programming (DP) is a broadly applicable algorithmic design paradigm
for the efficient, exact solution of otherwise intractable, combinatorial
problems. However, the design of such algorithms is often presented informally
in an ad-hoc manner, and as a result is often difficult to apply correctly. In
this paper, we present a rigorous algebraic formalism for systematically
deriving novel DP algorithms, either from existing DP algorithms or from simple
functional recurrences. These derivations lead to algorithms which are provably
correct and polymorphic over any semiring, which means that they can be applied
to the full scope of combinatorial problems expressible in terms of semirings.
This includes, for example: optimization, optimal probability and Viterbi
decoding, probabilistic marginalization, logical inference, fuzzy sets,
differentiable softmax, and relational and provenance queries. The approach,
building on many ideas from the existing literature on constructive
algorithmics, exploits generic properties of (semiring) polymorphic functions,
tupling and formal sums (lifting), and algebraic simplifications arising from
constraint algebras. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this formalism for
some example applications arising in signal processing, bioinformatics and
reliability engineering.</span>

                                        <span>Offline reinforcement learning proposes to learn policies from large
collected datasets without interacting with the physical environment. These
algorithms have made it possible to learn useful skills from data that can then
be deployed in the environment in real-world settings where interactions may be
costly or dangerous, such as autonomous driving or factories. However, current
algorithms overfit to the dataset they are trained on and exhibit poor
out-of-distribution generalization to the environment when deployed. In this
paper, we study the effectiveness of performing data augmentations on the state
space, and study 7 different augmentation schemes and how they behave with
existing offline RL algorithms. We then combine the best data performing
augmentation scheme with a state-of-the-art Q-learning technique, and improve
the function approximation of the Q-networks by smoothening out the learned
state-action space. We experimentally show that using this Surprisingly Simple
Self-Supervision technique in RL (S4RL), we significantly improve over the

                                        <span>The last decade has seen a significant increase of interest in deep learning
research, with many public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As
such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With
this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve
tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple
solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in
particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using
a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set
of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived
from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the
understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system
improve.

The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important
class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we
expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks
are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, &quot;create a
waterfall and take a scenic picture of it&quot;, with additional clarifying details.
Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they
want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description.
To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations
on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that
leverages these demonstrations.

Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI
systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent
cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can
also enable more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress
on the value alignment problem.</span>

                                        <span>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plots of true positive
rate versus false positive rate which are useful for evaluating binary
classification models, but difficult to use for learning since the Area Under
the Curve (AUC) is non-convex. ROC curves can also be used in other problems
that have false positive and true positive rates such as changepoint detection.
We show that in this more general context, the ROC curve can have loops, points
with highly sub-optimal error rates, and AUC greater than one. This observation
motivates a new optimization objective: rather than maximizing the AUC, we
would like a monotonic ROC curve with AUC&#x3D;1 that avoids points with large
values for Min(FP,FN). We propose a convex relaxation of this objective that
results in a new surrogate loss function called the AUM, short for Area Under
Min(FP, FN). Whereas previous loss functions are based on summing over all
labeled examples or pairs, the AUM requires a sort and a sum over the sequence
of points on the ROC curve. We show that AUM directional derivatives can be
efficiently computed and used in a gradient descent learning algorithm. In our
empirical study of supervised binary classification and changepoint detection
problems, we show that our new AUM minimization learning algorithm results in
improved AUC and comparable speed relative to previous baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful
representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining
techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,
ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations
among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the
structure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this
paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted
structural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system
termed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a
bi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to
efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack
method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior
arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it
particularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
Furthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by
employing it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in
enabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited
attackers&#x27; budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting,
BinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly
change the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems. Our research thus opens
the door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that
rely on graph data.</span>

                                        <span>Policy gradient (PG) algorithms have been widely used in reinforcement
learning (RL). However, PG algorithms rely on exploiting the value function
being learned with the first-order update locally, which results in limited
sample efficiency. In this work, we propose an alternative method called
Zeroth-Order Supervised Policy Improvement (ZOSPI). ZOSPI exploits the
estimated value function $Q$ globally while preserving the local exploitation
of the PG methods based on zeroth-order policy optimization. This learning
paradigm follows Q-learning but overcomes the difficulty of efficiently
operating argmax in continuous action space. It finds max-valued action within
a small number of samples. The policy learning of ZOSPI has two steps: First,
it samples actions and evaluates those actions with a learned value estimator,
and then it learns to perform the action with the highest value through
supervised learning. We further demonstrate such a supervised learning
framework can learn multi-modal policies. Experiments show that ZOSPI achieves
competitive results on the continuous control benchmarks with a remarkable
sample efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>A key challenge in adversarial robustness is the lack of a precise
mathematical characterization of human perception, used in the very definition
of adversarial attacks that are imperceptible to human eyes. Most current
attacks and defenses try to avoid this issue by considering restrictive
adversarial threat models such as those bounded by $L_2$ or $L_\infty$
distance, spatial perturbations, etc. However, models that are robust against
any of these restrictive threat models are still fragile against other threat
models. To resolve this issue, we propose adversarial training against the set
of all imperceptible adversarial examples, approximated using deep neural
networks. We call this threat model the neural perceptual threat model (NPTM);
it includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance (a
neural network-based approximation of the true perceptual distance) to natural
images. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the neural
perceptual distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of
adversarial examples, validating our threat model.

Under the NPTM, we develop novel perceptual adversarial attacks and defenses.
Because the NPTM is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training
(PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of
adversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against five
diverse adversarial attacks. We find that PAT achieves state-of-the-art
robustness against the union of these five attacks, more than doubling the
accuracy over the next best model, without training against any of them. That
is, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in
sensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and
to the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial training defense
with this property.</span>

ordering the information without any additional regularization. We demonstrate
how these models learn a representation that improves results in a variety of

                                        <span>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable results in a
variety of applications, recent studies exposed important shortcomings in their
ability to capture the structure of the underlying graph. It has been shown
that the expressive power of standard GNNs is bounded by the Weisfeiler-Leman
(WL) graph isomorphism test, from which they inherit proven limitations such as
the inability to detect and count graph substructures. On the other hand, there
is significant empirical evidence, e.g. in network science and bioinformatics,
that substructures are often intimately related to downstream tasks. To this
end, we propose &quot;Graph Substructure Networks&quot; (GSN), a topologically-aware
message passing scheme based on substructure encoding. We theoretically analyse
the expressive power of our architecture, showing that it is strictly more
expressive than the WL test, and provide sufficient conditions for
universality. Importantly, we do not attempt to adhere to the WL hierarchy;
this allows us to retain multiple attractive properties of standard GNNs such
as locality and linear network complexity, while being able to disambiguate
even hard instances of graph isomorphism. We perform an extensive experimental
evaluation on graph classification and regression tasks and obtain
state-of-the-art results in diverse real-world settings including molecular
graphs and social networks. The code is publicly available at

                                        <span>We study the problem of identifying the best arm in a stochastic multi-armed
bandit game. Given a set of $n$ arms indexed from $1$ to $n$, each arm $i$ is
associated with an unknown reward distribution supported on $[0,1]$ with mean
$\theta_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$. Assume $\theta_1 &gt; \theta_2 \geq \cdots
\geq\theta_n$. We propose an adaptive algorithm which explores the gaps and
variances of the rewards of the arms and makes future decisions based on the
gathered information using a novel approach called \textit{grouped median
elimination}. The proposed algorithm guarantees to output the best arm with
probability $(1-\delta)$ and uses at most $O \left(\sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^n
\left(\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\right)(\ln \delta^{-1}
+ \ln \ln \Delta_i^{-1})\right)$ samples, where $\Delta_i$ ($i \geq 2$) denotes
the reward gap between arm $i$ and the best arm and we define $\Delta_1 &#x3D;
\Delta_2$. This achieves a significant advantage over the variance-independent
algorithms in some favorable scenarios and is the first result that removes the
extra $\ln n$ factor on the best arm compared with the state-of-the-art. We
further show that $\Omega \left( \sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^n \left(
\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i} \right) \ln \delta^{-1}
\right)$ samples are necessary for an algorithm to achieve the same goal,
thereby illustrating that our algorithm is optimal up to doubly logarithmic

vocoder framework based on multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction
for discrete waveform modeling (MWDLP). MWDLP employs a coarse-fine bit WaveRNN
architecture for 10-bit mu-law waveform modeling. A sparse gated recurrent unit
with a relatively large size of hidden units is utilized, while the multiband
modeling is deployed to achieve real-time low-latency usage. A novel technique
for data-driven linear prediction (LP) with discrete waveform modeling is
proposed, where the LP coefficients are estimated in a data-driven manner.
Moreover, a novel loss function using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for
discrete waveform modeling with Gumbel approximation is also proposed. The

high-fidelity synthetic speech for seen and unseen speakers and/or language on
300 speakers training data including clean and noisy/reverberant conditions,

restless multi-arm bandits (RMAB). RMABs have been widely studied for
intervention planning with limited resources. However, most works make the
unrealistic assumption that the transition dynamics are known perfectly,
restricting the applicability of existing methods to real-world scenarios. To
make RMABs more useful in settings with uncertain dynamics: (i) We introduce
the Robust RMAB problem and develop solutions for a minimax regret objective
when transitions are given by interval uncertainties; (ii) We develop a double
oracle algorithm for solving Robust RMABs and demonstrate its effectiveness on
three experimental domains; (iii) To enable our double oracle approach, we
introduce RMABPPO, a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm for solving
RMABs. RMABPPO hinges on learning an auxiliary &quot;$\lambda$-network&quot; that allows
each arm&#x27;s learning to decouple, greatly reducing sample complexity required
for training; (iv) Under minimax regret, the adversary in the double oracle
approach is notoriously difficult to implement due to non-stationarity. To
address this, we formulate the adversary oracle as a multi-agent reinforcement
learning problem and solve it with a multi-agent extension of RMABPPO, which
may be of independent interest as the first known algorithm for this setting.

combining kernel smoothing, robust optimization, and adversarial training for
robust learning. Our methods are motivated by the convex analysis perspective
of distributionally robust optimization based on probability metrics, such as
the Wasserstein distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. We adapt the
integral operator using supremal convolution in convex analysis to form a novel
function majorant used for enforcing robustness. Our method is simple in form
and applies to general loss functions and machine learning models. Furthermore,
we report experiments with general machine learning models, such as deep neural
networks, to demonstrate that ARKS performs competitively with the

using GANs for other tasks unrelated to synthesis is underexplored. Do GANs
learn meaningful structural parts of objects during their attempt to reproduce
those objects? In this work, we test this hypothesis and propose a simple and
effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires
as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset. Our key idea is to
leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise representation from the input
image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments
demonstrate that GANs representation is &quot;readily discriminative&quot; and produces
surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised
baselines trained with significantly more labels. We believe this novel
repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation
learning that is applicable to many other tasks. More results are available at

                                        <span>Sentiment analysis is a costly yet necessary task for enterprises to study
the opinions of their customers to improve their products and to determine
optimal marketing strategies. Due to the existence of a wide range of domains
across different products and services, cross-domain sentiment analysis methods
have received significant attention. These methods mitigate the domain gap
between different applications by training cross-domain generalizable
classifiers which help to relax the need for data annotation for each domain.
Most existing methods focus on learning domain-agnostic representations that
are invariant with respect to both the source and the target domains. As a
result, a classifier that is trained using the source domain annotated data
would generalize well in a related target domain. We introduce a new domain
adaptation method which induces large margins between different classes in an
embedding space. This embedding space is trained to be domain-agnostic by
matching the data distributions across the domains. Large intraclass margins in
the source domain help to reduce the effect of &quot;domain shift&quot; on the classifier
performance in the target domain. Theoretical and empirical analysis are
provided to demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.</span>

refines the output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system so as to
exclude ASR errors. Generally, neural correction models are composed of
encoder-decoder networks, which can directly model sequence-to-sequence mapping
problems. The most successful method is to use both input speech and its ASR
output text as the input contexts for the encoder-decoder networks. However,
the conventional method cannot take into account the relationships between
these two different modal inputs because the input contexts are separately
encoded for each modal. To effectively leverage the correlated information
between the two different modal inputs, our proposed models encode two
different contexts jointly on the basis of cross-modal self-attention using a
transformer. We expect that cross-modal self-attention can effectively capture
the relationships between two different modals for refining ASR hypotheses. We
also introduce a shallow fusion technique to efficiently integrate the
first-pass ASR model and our proposed neural correction model. Experiments on
Japanese natural language ASR tasks demonstrated that our proposed models
achieve better ASR performance than conventional neural correction models.</span>

                                        <span>First-price auctions have largely replaced traditional bidding approaches
based on Vickrey auctions in programmatic advertising. As far as learning is
concerned, first-price auctions are more challenging because the optimal
bidding strategy does not only depend on the value of the item but also
requires some knowledge of the other bids. They have already given rise to
several works in sequential learning, many of which consider models for which
the value of the buyer or the opponents&#x27; maximal bid is chosen in an
adversarial manner. Even in the simplest settings, this gives rise to
algorithms whose regret grows as $\sqrt{T}$ with respect to the time horizon
$T$. Focusing on the case where the buyer plays against a stationary stochastic
environment, we show how to achieve significantly lower regret: when the
opponents&#x27; maximal bid distribution is known we provide an algorithm whose
regret can be as low as $\log^2(T)$; in the case where the distribution must be
learnt sequentially, a generalization of this algorithm can achieve $T^{1/3+
\epsilon}$ regret, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. To obtain these results, we introduce
two novel ideas that can be of interest in their own right. First, by
transposing results obtained in the posted price setting, we provide conditions
under which the first-price biding utility is locally quadratic around its
optimum. Second, we leverage the observation that, on small sub-intervals, the
concentration of the variations of the empirical distribution function may be
controlled more accurately than by using the classical
Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality. Numerical simulations confirm that our
algorithms converge much faster than alternatives proposed in the literature
for various bid distributions, including for bids collected on an actual
programmatic advertising platform.</span>

                                        <span>Query reformulation aims to alter noisy or ambiguous text sequences into
coherent ones closer to natural language questions. This is to prevent errors
from propagating in a client-facing pipeline and promote better communication
with users. Besides, it is crucial to maintain performance in downstream
environments like question answering when rephrased queries are given as input.
We show that under the previous framework (AQA), attempts to alter RL
algorithms do not bring significant benefits to either reward acquisition or
sequence fluency. Instead, we leverage a query-reformulating text-to-text
transformer (QRT5) and apply policy-based RL algorithms to further nudge this
reformulator and obtain better answers downstream by generating
reward-acquiring query trajectories. QRT5 shows better sample efficiency in RL
to achieve the same level of QA performance as the previous approach. It can
generate reformulations with more readability based on query well-formedness
evaluations and can generalize to out-of-sample data. Our framework is
demonstrated to be flexible, allowing reward signals to be sourced from
different downstream environments such as intent classification.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning provides a promising way to extract effective representations
from raw data in an end-to-end fashion and has proven its effectiveness in
various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc.
However, in domains such as content/product recommendation and risk management,
where sequence of event data is the most used raw data form and experts derived
features are more commonly used, deep learning models struggle to dominate the
game. In this paper, we propose a symbolic testing framework that helps to
answer the question of what kinds of expert-derived features could be learned
by a neural network. Inspired by this testing framework, we introduce an
efficient architecture named SHORING, which contains two components:
\textit{event network} and \textit{sequence network}. The \textit{event}
network learns arbitrarily yet efficiently high-order \textit{event-level}
embeddings via a provable reparameterization trick, the \textit{sequence}
network aggregates from sequence of \textit{event-level} embeddings. We argue
that SHORING is capable of learning certain standard symbolic expressions which
the standard multi-head self-attention network fails to learn, and conduct
comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on four synthetic datasets and
three real-world datasets. The results show that SHORING empirically
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Thompson sampling and other Bayesian sequential decision-making algorithms
are among the most popular approaches to tackle explore/exploit trade-offs in
(contextual) bandits. The choice of prior in these algorithms offers
flexibility to encode domain knowledge but can also lead to poor performance
when misspecified. In this paper, we demonstrate that performance degrades
gracefully with misspecification. We prove that the expected reward accrued by
Thompson sampling (TS) with a misspecified prior differs by at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2 \epsilon)$ from TS with a well specified prior, where
$\epsilon$ is the total-variation distance between priors and $H$ is the
learning horizon. Our bound does not require the prior to have any parametric
form. For priors with bounded support, our bound is independent of the
cardinality or structure of the action space, and we show that it is tight up
to universal constants in the worst case.

Building on our sensitivity analysis, we establish generic PAC guarantees for
algorithms in the recently studied Bayesian meta-learning setting and derive
corollaries for various families of priors. Our results generalize along two
axes: (1) they apply to a broader family of Bayesian decision-making
algorithms, including a Monte-Carlo implementation of the knowledge gradient
algorithm (KG), and (2) they apply to Bayesian POMDPs, the most general
Bayesian decision-making setting, encompassing contextual bandits as a special
case. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate how prior misspecification
and the deployment of one-step look-ahead (as in KG) can impact the convergence
of meta-learning in multi-armed and contextual bandits with structured and
correlated priors.</span>

the Causal Markov Assumption, the Strong Causal Faithfulness Assumption, and
the assumption of causal sufficiency, the PC algorithm is a uniformly
consistent estimator of the Markov Equivalence Class of the true causal DAG for
linear Gaussian models; it follows from this that for the identifiable causal
effects in the Markov Equivalence Class, there are uniformly consistent
estimators of causal effects as well. The $k$-Triangle-Faithfulness Assumption
is a strictly weaker assumption that avoids some implausible implications of
the Strong Causal Faithfulness Assumption and also allows for uniformly
consistent estimates of Markov Equivalence Classes (in a weakened sense), and
of identifiable causal effects. However, both of these assumptions are
restricted to linear Gaussian models. We propose the Generalized $k$-Triangle
Faithfulness, which can be applied to any smooth distribution. In addition,
under the Generalized $k$-Triangle Faithfulness Assumption, we describe the
Edge Estimation Algorithm that provides uniformly consistent estimates of
causal effects in some cases (and otherwise outputs &quot;can&#x27;t tell&quot;), and the
\textit{Very Conservative }$SGS$ Algorithm that (in a slightly weaker sense) is
a uniformly consistent estimator of the Markov equivalence class of the true

if each fault model is to be engineered by hand. Data-driven approaches, using
Machine Learning (ML) for detecting faults have recently gained increasing
interest, where a ML model can be trained on a set of data from a manufacturing
process. In this paper, we present a use case of using ML models for detecting
faults during automated screwdriving operations, and introduce a new dataset

with the use of two time-series ML models, how to detect faults in an automated

                                        <span>Image classification models tend to make decisions based on peripheral
attributes of data items that have strong correlation with a target variable
(i.e., dataset bias). These biased models suffer from the poor generalization
capability when evaluated on unbiased datasets. Existing approaches for
debiasing often identify and emphasize those samples with no such correlation
(i.e., bias-conflicting) without defining the bias type in advance. However,
such bias-conflicting samples are significantly scarce in biased datasets,
limiting the debiasing capability of these approaches. This paper first
presents an empirical analysis revealing that training with &quot;diverse&quot;
bias-conflicting samples beyond a given training set is crucial for debiasing
as well as the generalization capability. Based on this observation, we propose
a novel feature-level data augmentation technique in order to synthesize
diverse bias-conflicting samples. To this end, our method learns the
disentangled representation of (1) the intrinsic attributes (i.e., those
inherently defining a certain class) and (2) bias attributes (i.e., peripheral
attributes causing the bias), from a large number of bias-aligned samples, the
bias attributes of which have strong correlation with the target variable.
Using the disentangled representation, we synthesize bias-conflicting samples
that contain the diverse intrinsic attributes of bias-aligned samples by
swapping their latent features. By utilizing these diversified bias-conflicting
features during the training, our approach achieves superior classification
accuracy and debiasing results against the existing baselines on both synthetic
as well as real-world datasets.</span>

education has received increasing attention. However, the use of screens in
classrooms is often met with resistance, especially in primary school. To
address this issue, this study presents the development of a handwriting-based
programming language for educational robots. Aiming to align better with
existing classroom practices, it allows students to program a robot by drawing
symbols with ordinary pens and paper. Regular smartphones are leveraged to
process the hand-drawn instructions using computer vision and machine learning
algorithms, and send the commands to the robot for execution. To align with the
local computer science curriculum, an appropriate playground and scaffolded
learning tasks were designed. The system was evaluated in a preliminary test
with eight teachers, developers and educational researchers. While the
participants pointed out that some technical aspects could be improved, they
also acknowledged the potential of the approach to make computer science
education in primary school more accessible.</span>

with its ability to learn a unified and robust graph from multiple views.
However, existing graph learning methods mostly focus on the multi-view
consistency issue, yet often neglect the inconsistency across multiple views,
which makes them vulnerable to possibly low-quality or noisy datasets. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a new multi-view graph learning framework,
which for the first time simultaneously and explicitly models multi-view
consistency and multi-view inconsistency in a unified objective function,
through which the consistent and inconsistent parts of each single-view graph
as well as the unified graph that fuses the consistent parts can be iteratively
learned. Though optimizing the objective function is NP-hard, we design a
highly efficient optimization algorithm which is able to obtain an approximate
solution with linear time complexity in the number of edges in the unified
graph. Furthermore, our multi-view graph learning approach can be applied to
both similarity graphs and dissimilarity graphs, which lead to two graph
fusion-based variants in our framework. Experiments on twelve multi-view
datasets have demonstrated the robustness and efficiency of the proposed
approach.</span>

by specific optimization algorithms tend to generalize well to unseen data.
Recently, researchers explained it by investigating the implicit regularization
effect of optimization algorithms. A remarkable progress is the work (Lyu&amp;Li,
2019), which proves gradient descent (GD) maximizes the margin of homogeneous
deep neural networks. Except GD, adaptive algorithms such as AdaGrad, RMSProp
and Adam are popular owing to their rapid training process. However,
theoretical guarantee for the generalization of adaptive optimization
algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we study the implicit
regularization of adaptive optimization algorithms when they are optimizing the
logistic loss on homogeneous deep neural networks. We prove that adaptive
algorithms that adopt exponential moving average strategy in conditioner (such
as Adam and RMSProp) can maximize the margin of the neural network, while
AdaGrad that directly sums historical squared gradients in conditioner can not.
It indicates superiority on generalization of exponential moving average
strategy in the design of the conditioner. Technically, we provide a unified
framework to analyze convergent direction of adaptive optimization algorithms
by constructing novel adaptive gradient flow and surrogate margin. Our
experiments can well support the theoretical findings on convergent direction
of adaptive optimization algorithms.</span>

easily be manipulated by adversarial attacks against network interpretability,
we study the problem of interpretation robustness from a new perspective of
\Renyi differential privacy (RDP). The advantages of our Renyi-Robust-Smooth
(RDP-based interpretation method) are three-folds. First, it can offer provable
and certifiable top-$k$ robustness. That is, the top-$k$ important attributions
of the interpretation map are provably robust under any input perturbation with
bounded $\ell_d$-norm (for any $d\geq 1$, including $d &#x3D; \infty$). Second, our
proposed method offers $\sim10\%$ better experimental robustness than existing
approaches in terms of the top-$k$ attributions. Remarkably, the accuracy of
Renyi-Robust-Smooth also outperforms existing approaches. Third, our method can
provide a smooth tradeoff between robustness and computational efficiency.
Experimentally, its top-$k$ attributions are {\em twice} more robust than
existing approaches when the computational resources are highly constrained.</span>

subset of relevant features as a rationale of a prediction. Task-dependent by
nature, precise definitions of &quot;relevance&quot; encountered in the literature are
however not always consistent. This lack of clarity stems from the fact that we
usually do not have access to any notion of ground-truth attribution and from a
more general debate on what good interpretations are. In this paper we propose
to formalise feature selection/attribution based on the concept of relaxed
functional dependence. In particular, we extend our notions to the
instance-wise setting and derive necessary properties for candidate selection
solutions, while leaving room for task-dependence. By computing ground-truth
attributions on synthetic datasets, we evaluate many state-of-the-art

                                        <span>The goal of text generation is to make machines express in human language. It
is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language
processing (NLP). Since 2014, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered
by Seq2Seq have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text
to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge
to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still
far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue,
researchers have considered incorporating various forms of knowledge beyond the
input text into the generation models. This research direction is known as
knowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive
review of the research on knowledge enhanced text generation over the past five
years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and
architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific
techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data.
This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in
academia and industry.</span>

at the instance level is provided for over 10,000 images and annotation for
other tasks are provided for over 100,000 images. With WoodScape, we would like

                                        <span>Solar energy is a clean and renewable energy. Photovoltaic (PV) power is an
important way to utilize solar energy. Accurate PV power forecast is crucial to
the large-scale application of PV power and the stability of electricity grid.
This paper proposes a novel method for short-term photovoltaic power forecast
using deep convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network and kernel
density estimation (KDE). In the proposed method, ConvLSTM is used to forecast
the future photovoltaic power and KDE is used for estimating the joint
probabilistic density function and giving the probabilistic confidence
interval. Experiments in an actual photovoltaic power station verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison experiments with convolutional
neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM)shows that
ConvLSTM can combine the advantages of both CNN and LSTM and significantly
outperform CNN and LSTM in terms of forecast accuracy. Through further
comparison with other five conventional methods including multilayer perceptron
(MLP), support vector regression (SVR), extreme learning machine (ELM),
classification and regression tree (CART) and gradient boosting decision tree
(GBDT), ConvLSTM can significantly improve the forecast accuracy by more than
20% for most of the five methods and the superiorities of ConvLSTM are further
verified.</span>

accumulation spaces and transport channels of oil and gas. Fracture detection
is a fundamental task for reservoir characterization. From prestack seismic
gathers, anisotropic analysis and inversion were commonly applied to
characterize the dominant orientations and relative intensities of fractures.
However, the existing methods were mostly based on the vertical aligned facture
hypothesis, it is impossible for them to recognize fracture dip. Furthermore,
it is difficult or impractical for existing methods to attain the real fracture
densities. Based on data-driven deep learning, this paper designed a
convolutional neural network to perform prestack fracture detection.
Capitalizing on the connections between seismic responses and fracture
parameters, a suitable azimuth dataset was firstly generated through fracture
effective medium modeling and anisotropic plane wave analyzing. Then a
multi-input and multi-output convolutional neural network was constructed to
simultaneously detect fracture density, dip and strike azimuth. The application
on a practical survey validated the effectiveness of the proposed CNN model.</span>

                                        <span>Can we use machine learning to compress graph data? The absence of ordering
in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms,
limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant
patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on
domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different
underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary
principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the
entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the
graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that
can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our &quot;Partition and
Code&quot; framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes
the graph into elementary structures, then these are mapped to the elements of
a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally,
an entropy encoder translates the representation into bits. All three steps are
parametric and can be trained with gradient descent. We theoretically compare
the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove, under mild
conditions, a total ordering of their expected description lengths. Moreover,
we show that, under the same conditions, PnC achieves compression gains w.r.t.

uncovered a surprising finding: when conducting ablation studies on existing
pruning-at-initialization methods, namely SNIP, GraSP, SynFlow, and magnitude
pruning, performances of these methods remain unchanged and sometimes even
improve when randomly shuffling the mask positions within each layer (Layerwise
Shuffling) or sampling new initial weight values (Reinit), while keeping
pruning masks the same. We attempt to understand the reason behind such network

                                        <span>Although recent works have developed methods that can generate estimations
(or imputations) of the missing entries in a dataset to facilitate downstream
analysis, most depend on assumptions that may not align with real-world
applications and could suffer from poor performance in subsequent tasks. This
is particularly true if the data have large missingness rates or a small
population. More importantly, the imputation error could be propagated into the
prediction step that follows, causing the gradients used to train the
prediction models to be biased. Consequently, in this work, we introduce the
importance guided stochastic gradient descent (IGSGD) method to train
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and long short-term memories (LSTMs) to directly
perform inference from inputs containing missing values without imputation.
Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to adjust the gradients
used to train the models via back-propagation. This not only reduces bias but
allows the model to exploit the underlying information behind missingness
patterns. We test the proposed approach on real-world time-series (i.e.,
MIMIC-III), tabular data obtained from an eye clinic, and a standard dataset
(i.e., MNIST), where our imputation-free predictions outperform the traditional
two-step imputation-based predictions using state-of-the-art imputation
methods.</span>

nonatomic games, in both discrete and continuous time. The class of dynamics
under consideration includes fictitious play and its regularized variants, the
best-reply dynamics (again, possibly regularized), as well as the dynamics of
dual averaging / &quot;follow the regularized leader&quot; (which themselves include as
special cases the replicator dynamics and Friedman&#x27;s projection dynamics). Our
analysis concerns both the actual trajectory of play and its time-average, and
we cover potential and monotone games, as well as games with an evolutionarily
stable state (global or otherwise). We focus exclusively on games with finite
action spaces; nonatomic games with continuous action spaces are treated in

                                        <span>In today&#x27;s networked society, many real-world problems can be formalized as
predicting links in networks, such as Facebook friendship suggestions,
e-commerce recommendations, and the prediction of scientific collaborations in
citation networks. Increasingly often, link prediction problem is tackled by
means of network embedding methods, owing to their state-of-the-art
performance. However, these methods lack transparency when compared to simpler
baselines, and as a result their robustness against adversarial attacks is a
possible point of concern: could one or a few small adversarial modifications
to the network have a large impact on the link prediction performance when
using a network embedding model? Prior research has already investigated
adversarial robustness for network embedding models, focused on classification
at the node and graph level. Robustness with respect to the link prediction
downstream task, on the other hand, has been explored much less.

This paper contributes to filling this gap, by studying adversarial
robustness of Conditional Network Embedding (CNE), a state-of-the-art
probabilistic network embedding model, for link prediction. More specifically,
given CNE and a network, we measure the sensitivity of the link predictions of
the model to small adversarial perturbations of the network, namely changes of
the link status of a node pair. Thus, our approach allows one to identify the
links and non-links in the network that are most vulnerable to such
perturbations, for further investigation by an analyst. We analyze the
characteristics of the most and least sensitive perturbations, and empirically
confirm that our approach not only succeeds in identifying the most vulnerable
links and non-links, but also that it does so in a time-efficient manner thanks
to an effective approximation.</span>

needs to model both rhymes and rhythms. Previous works for rap generation
focused on rhyming lyrics but ignored rhythmic beats, which are important for
rap performance. In this paper, we develop DeepRapper, a Transformer-based rap
generation system that can model both rhymes and rhythms. Since there is no
available rap dataset with rhythmic beats, we develop a data mining pipeline to
collect a large-scale rap dataset, which includes a large number of rap songs
with aligned lyrics and rhythmic beats. Second, we design a Transformer-based
autoregressive language model which carefully models rhymes and rhythms.
Specifically, we generate lyrics in the reverse order with rhyme representation
and constraint for rhyme enhancement and insert a beat symbol into lyrics for
rhythm/beat modeling. To our knowledge, DeepRapper is the first system to
generate rap with both rhymes and rhythms. Both objective and subjective
evaluations demonstrate that DeepRapper generates creative and high-quality
raps with rhymes and rhythms. Code will be released on GitHub.</span>

delivery of a practically serviceable model is still a highly time-consuming
process. Furthermore, a resulting model is usually too generic and heavyweight,
and hence essentially goes through another expensive model compression phase to
fit in a resource-limited device like embedded systems. Inspired by the fact
that a machine learning task specifically requested by mobile users is often
much simpler than it is supported by a massive generic model, this paper
proposes a framework, called Pool of Experts (PoE), that instantly builds a
lightweight and task-specific model without any training process. For a
realtime model querying service, PoE first extracts a pool of primitive
components, called experts, from a well-trained and sufficiently generic
network by exploiting a novel conditional knowledge distillation method, and
then performs our train-free knowledge consolidation to quickly combine
necessary experts into a lightweight network for a target task. Thanks to this
train-free property, in our thorough empirical study, PoE can build a fairly
accurate yet compact model in a realtime manner, whereas it takes a few minutes
per query for the other training methods to achieve a similar level of the
accuracy.</span>

competitions, recommendations, and so on, attackers have strong motivation and
incentives to manipulate the ranking list. They could inject malicious
comparisons into the training data to fool the victim. Such a technique is
called poisoning attack in regression and classification tasks. In this paper,
to the best of our knowledge, we initiate the first systematic investigation of
data poisoning attacks on pairwise ranking algorithms, which can be formalized
as the dynamic and static games between the ranker and the attacker and can be
modeled as certain kinds of integer programming problems. To break the
computational hurdle of the underlying integer programming problems, we
reformulate them into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems,
which are computationally tractable. Based on such DRO formulations, we propose
two efficient poisoning attack algorithms and establish the associated
theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness of the suggested poisoning attack
strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy simulations and several real data
experiments. These experimental results show that the proposed methods can
significantly reduce the performance of the ranker in the sense that the
correlation between the true ranking list and the aggregated results can be
decreased dramatically.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a novel pooling layer for graph neural networks
based on maximizing the mutual information between the pooled graph and the
input graph. Since the maximum mutual information is difficult to compute, we
employ the Shannon capacity of a graph as an inductive bias to our pooling
method. More precisely, we show that the input graph to the pooling layer can
be viewed as a representation of a noisy communication channel. For such a
channel, sending the symbols belonging to an independent set of the graph
yields a reliable and error-free transmission of information. We show that
reaching the maximum mutual information is equivalent to finding a maximum
weight independent set of the graph where the weights convey entropy contents.
Through this communication theoretic standpoint, we provide a distinct
perspective for posing the problem of graph pooling as maximizing the
information transmission rate across a noisy communication channel, implemented
by a graph neural network. We evaluate our method, referred to as Maximum
Entropy Weighted Independent Set Pooling (MEWISPool), on graph classification
tasks and the combinatorial optimization problem of the maximum independent
set. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art and competitive results on graph classification tasks and the
maximum independent set problem in several benchmark datasets.</span>

communication complexity. Our motivation is to understand the
statistical-computational trade-offs in streaming, sketching, and query-based

these models, yet many prior results do not hold in an average-case setting. We
provide a general reduction method that preserves the input distribution for
problems involving a random graph or matrix with planted structure. Then, we
derive two-party and multi-party communication lower bounds for detecting or
finding planted cliques, bipartite cliques, and related problems. As a
consequence, we obtain new bounds on the query complexity in the edge-probe,
vector-matrix-vector, matrix-vector, linear sketching, and
$\mathbb{F}_2$-sketching models. Many of these results are nearly tight, and we
use our techniques to provide simple proofs of some known lower bounds for the

                                        <span>Can one learn to diagnose COVID-19 under extreme minimal supervision? Since
the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 there has been a rush for developing
Artificial Intelligence techniques for expert-level disease identification on
Chest X-ray data. In particular, the use of deep supervised learning has become
the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily
dependent on the availability of a large and representative labelled dataset.
The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and
especially imposes a great challenge for a novel disease. Semi-supervised
learning has shown the ability to match the incredible performance of
supervised models whilst requiring a small fraction of the labelled examples.
This makes the semi-supervised paradigm an attractive option for identifying
COVID-19. In this work, we introduce a graph based deep semi-supervised
framework for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Our framework introduces
an optimisation model for graph diffusion that reinforces the natural relation
among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled data. We then connect the
diffusion prediction output as pseudo-labels that are used in an iterative
scheme in a deep net. We demonstrate, through our experiments, that our model
is able to outperform the current leading supervised model with a tiny fraction
of the labelled examples. Finally, we provide attention maps to accommodate the
radiologist&#x27;s mental model, better fitting their perceptual and cognitive
abilities. These visualisation aims to assist the radiologist in judging
whether the diagnostic is correct or not, and in consequence to accelerate the
decision.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks are very successful tools in for example advanced
classification. From a statistical point of view, fitting a neural network may
be seen as a kind of regression, where we seek a function from the input space
to a space of classification probabilities that follows the &quot;general&quot; shape of
the data, but avoids overfitting by avoiding memorization of individual data
points. In statistics, this can be done by controlling the geometric complexity
of the regression function. We propose to do something similar when fitting
neural networks by controlling the slope of the network.

After defining the slope and discussing some of its theoretical properties,
we go on to show empirically in examples, using ReLU networks, that the
distribution of the slope of a well-trained neural network classifier is
generally independent of the width of the layers in a fully connected network,
and that the mean of the distribution only has a weak dependence on the model
architecture in general. The slope is of similar size throughout the relevant
volume, and varies smoothly. It also behaves as predicted in rescaling
examples. We discuss possible applications of the slope concept, such as using
it as a part of the loss function or stopping criterion during network
training, or ranking data sets in terms of their complexity.</span>

                                        <span>When trained at sufficient scale, auto-regressive language models exhibit the
notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Adaptive optimization methods have been widely used in deep learning. They
scale the learning rates adaptively according to the past gradient, which has
been shown to be effective to accelerate the convergence. However, they suffer
from poor generalization performance compared with SGD. Recent studies point
that smoothing exponential gradient noise leads to generalization degeneration
phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose AdaL, with a transformation on the
original gradient. AdaL accelerates the convergence by amplifying the gradient
in the early stage, as well as dampens the oscillation and stabilizes the
optimization by shrinking the gradient later. Such modification alleviates the
smoothness of gradient noise, which produces better generalization performance.
We have theoretically proved the convergence of AdaL and demonstrated its
effectiveness on several benchmarks.</span>

remotely in inaccessible places: the robot could reproduce in the remote
location the movements of an operator equipped with a wearable motion capture
device while sending visual feedback to the operator. While substantial
progress has been made on transferring (&quot;retargeting&quot;) human motions to
humanoid robots, a major problem preventing the deployment of such systems in
real applications is the presence of communication delays between the human
input and the feedback from the robot: even a few hundred milliseconds of delay
can irreversibly disturb the operator, let alone a few seconds. To overcome
these delays, we introduce a system in which a humanoid robot executes commands
before it actually receives them, so that the visual feedback appears to be
synchronized to the operator, whereas the robot executed the commands in the
past. To do so, the robot continuously predicts future commands by querying a
machine learning model that is trained on past trajectories and conditioned on
the last received commands. In our experiments, an operator was able to
successfully control a humanoid robot (32 degrees of freedom) with stochastic
delays up to 2 seconds in several whole-body manipulation tasks, including
reaching different targets, picking up, and placing a box at distinct
locations.</span>

                                        <span>Motivated by recent increased interest in optimization algorithms for
non-convex optimization in application to training deep neural networks and
other optimization problems in data analysis, we give an overview of recent
theoretical results on global performance guarantees of optimization algorithms
for non-convex optimization. We start with classical arguments showing that
general non-convex problems could not be solved efficiently in a reasonable
time. Then we give a list of problems that can be solved efficiently to find
the global minimizer by exploiting the structure of the problem as much as it
is possible. Another way to deal with non-convexity is to relax the goal from
finding the global minimum to finding a stationary point or a local minimum.
For this setting, we first present known results for the convergence rates of
deterministic first-order methods, which are then followed by a general
theoretical analysis of optimal stochastic and randomized gradient schemes, and
an overview of the stochastic first-order methods. After that, we discuss quite
general classes of non-convex problems, such as minimization of
$\alpha$-weakly-quasi-convex functions and functions that satisfy
Polyak--Lojasiewicz condition, which still allow obtaining theoretical
convergence guarantees of first-order methods. Then we consider higher-order
and zeroth-order/derivative-free methods and their convergence rates for
non-convex optimization problems.</span>

function for OT from observed transport plan or its samples. In this paper, we
derive an unconstrained convex optimization formulation of the inverse OT
problem, which can be further augmented by any customizable regularization. We
provide a comprehensive characterization of the properties of inverse OT,
including uniqueness of solutions. We also develop two numerical algorithms,

discrete OT, and the other one is a learning based algorithm that parameterizes
the cost function as a deep neural network for continuous OT. The novel
framework proposed in the work avoids repeatedly solving a forward OT in each

model performance in an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting. Semantic
segmentation and monocular depth estimation are shown to be complementary
tasks; in a multi-task learning setting, a proper encoding of their
relationships can further improve performance on both tasks. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a novel Cross-Task Relation Layer (CTRL), which encodes
task dependencies between the semantic and depth predictions. To capture the
cross-task relationships, we propose a neural network architecture that
contains task-specific and cross-task refinement heads. Furthermore, we propose
an Iterative Self-Learning (ISL) training scheme, which exploits semantic
pseudo-labels to provide extra supervision on the target domain. We
experimentally observe improvements in both tasks&#x27; performance because the
complementary information present in these tasks is better captured.
Specifically, we show that: (1) our approach improves performance on all tasks
when they are complementary and mutually dependent; (2) the CTRL helps to
improve both semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks performance in
the challenging UDA setting; (3) the proposed ISL training scheme further
improves the semantic segmentation performance. The implementation is available

propagation-based methods have made significant progress in addressing node
classification tasks on graphs. However, in addition to their reliance on
elaborate architectures and algorithms, there are several key technical details
that are frequently overlooked, and yet nonetheless can play a vital role in

label usage, loss function formulation, and model design that can significantly
improve various GNN architectures. We empirically evaluate their impact on
final node classification accuracy by conducting ablation studies and
demonstrate consistently-improved performance, often to an extent that

(data scientists or AI developers). However, increasing importance has been
argued for making AI more understandable to nonexperts, who are expected to
leverage AI techniques, but have limited knowledge about AI. We present a
mobile application to support nonexperts to interactively make sense of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); it allows users to play with a pretrained
CNN by taking pictures of their surrounding objects. We use an up-to-date XAI
technique (Class Activation Map) to intuitively visualize the model&#x27;s decision
(the most important image regions that lead to a certain result). Deployed in a
university course, this playful learning tool was found to support design
students to gain vivid understandings about the capabilities and limitations of
pretrained CNNs in real-world environments. Concrete examples of students&#x27;
playful explorations are reported to characterize their sensemaking processes
reflecting different depths of thought.</span>

                                        <span>A fundamental problem when aggregating Markov chains is the specification of
the number of state groups. Too few state groups may fail to sufficiently
capture the pertinent dynamics of the original, high-order Markov chain. Too
many state groups may lead to a non-parsimonious, reduced-order Markov chain
whose complexity rivals that of the original. In this paper, we show that an
augmented value-of-information-based approach to aggregating Markov chains
facilitates the determination of the number of state groups. The optimal
state-group count coincides with the case where the complexity of the
reduced-order chain is balanced against the mutual dependence between the
original- and reduced-order chain dynamics.</span>

                                        <span>Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node
representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold
structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the
graph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of
communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold
structures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most
statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called
latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,
allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold
structure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model,
the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the
latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising
from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and
real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying
communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form
of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety
of real data.</span>

                                        <span>The slowness principle is a concept inspired by the visual cortex of the
brain. It postulates that the underlying generative factors of a quickly
varying sensory signal change on a slower time scale. Unsupervised learning of
intermediate representations utilizing abundant unlabeled sensory data can be
leveraged to perform data-efficient supervised downstream regression. In this
paper, we propose a general formulation of slowness for unsupervised
representation learning adding a slowness regularization term to the estimate
lower bound of the beta-VAE to encourage temporal similarity in observation and
latent space. Within this framework we compare existing slowness regularization
terms such as the L1 and L2 loss used in existing end-to-end methods, the
SlowVAE and propose a new term based on Brownian motion. We empirically
evaluate these slowness regularization terms with respect to their downstream
task performance and data efficiency. We find that slow representations lead to
equal or better downstream task performance and data efficiency in different
experiment domains when compared to representations without slowness
regularization. Finally, we discuss how the Frechet Inception Distance (FID),
traditionally used to determine the generative capabilities of GANs, can serve
as a measure to predict the performance of pre-trained Autoencoder model in a
supervised downstream task and accelerate hyperparameter search.</span>

$\mathbb{R}^d$, and prove an information theoretic lower bound on the number of
stochastic gradient queries of the log density needed. Several popular sampling
algorithms (including many Markov chain Monte Carlo methods) operate by using
stochastic gradients of the log density to generate a sample; our results
establish an information theoretic limit for all these algorithms.

We show that for every algorithm, there exists a well-conditioned strongly
log-concave target density for which the distribution of points generated by
the algorithm would be at least $\varepsilon$ away from the target in total
variation distance if the number of gradient queries is less than
$\Omega(\sigma^2 d/\varepsilon^2)$, where $\sigma^2 d$ is the variance of the
stochastic gradient. Our lower bound follows by combining the ideas of Le Cam
deficiency routinely used in the comparison of statistical experiments along
with standard information theoretic tools used in lower bounding Bayes risk
functions. To the best of our knowledge our results provide the first
nontrivial dimension-dependent lower bound for this problem.</span>

training models that can quickly adapt to new tasks via one or few stochastic
gradient descent steps. However, the MAML objective is significantly more
difficult to optimize compared to standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM),
and little is understood about how much MAML improves over ERM in terms of the
fast adaptability of their solutions in various scenarios. We analytically
address this issue in a linear regression setting consisting of a mixture of
easy and hard tasks, where hardness is related to the condition number of the
task&#x27;s loss function. Specifically, we prove that in order for MAML to achieve
substantial gain over ERM, (i) there must be some discrepancy in hardness among
the tasks, and (ii) the optimal solutions of the hard tasks must be closely
packed with the center far from the center of the easy tasks optimal solutions.
We also give numerical and analytical results suggesting that these insights
also apply to two-layer neural networks. Finally, we provide few-shot image
classification experiments that support our insights for when MAML should be
used and emphasize the importance of training MAML on hard tasks in practice.</span>

nanomedicine in imaging and treatment, but computational models to describe the
NPs distribution remain unavailable due to the complex tumor-nano interactions.
Here, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network for Distribution Analysis
(GANDA) to describe and conditionally generates the intratumoral quantum dots
(QDs) distribution after i.v. injection. This deep generative model is trained
automatically by 27 775 patches of tumor vessels and cell nuclei decomposed
from whole-slide images of 4T1 breast cancer sections. The GANDA model can
conditionally generate images of intratumoral QDs distribution under the
constraint of given tumor vessels and cell nuclei channels with the same
spatial resolution (pixels-to-pixels), minimal loss (mean squared error, MSE &#x3D;
1.871) and excellent reliability (intraclass correlation, ICC &#x3D; 0.94).
Quantitative analysis of QDs extravasation distance (ICC &#x3D; 0.95) and subarea
distribution (ICC &#x3D; 0.99) is allowed on the generated images without knowing
the real QDs distribution. We believe this deep generative model may provide

and multimedia forensics over the last decade, these systems are still
vulnerable to attacks in real-life settings. Some of the challenges for
existing solutions are the detection of unknown attacks, the ability to perform
in adversarial settings, few-shot learning, and explainability. In this study,
these limitations are approached by reliance on a game-theoretic view for
modeling the interactions between the attacker and the detector. Consequently,
a new optimization criterion is proposed and a set of requirements are defined
for improving the performance of these systems in real-life settings.
Furthermore, a novel detection technique is proposed using generator-based
feature sets that are not biased towards any specific attack species. To
further optimize the performance on known attacks, a new loss function coined
categorical margin maximization loss (C-marmax) is proposed which gradually
improves the performance against the most powerful attack. The proposed
approach provides a more balanced performance across known and unknown attacks
and achieves state-of-the-art performance in known and unknown attack detection
cases against rational attackers. Lastly, the few-shot learning potential of
the proposed approach is studied as well as its ability to provide pixel-level
explainability.</span>

agent to learn from a fixed offline dataset of logged interactions, which has
already been gathered, without offering further possibility for data
collection. However, commonly used off-policy RL algorithms, such as the Deep Q
Network and the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, are incapable of learning
without data correlated to the distribution under the current policy, making
them ineffective for this offline setting. As the first step towards useful
offline RL algorithms, we analysis the reason of instability in standard
off-policy RL algorithms. It is due to the bootstrapping error. The key to
avoiding this error, is ensuring that the agent&#x27;s action space does not go out
of the fixed offline dataset. Based on our consideration, a creative offline RL
framework, the Least Restriction (LR), is proposed in this paper. The LR
regards selecting an action as taking a sample from the probability
distribution. It merely set a little limit for action selection, which not only
avoid the action being out of the offline dataset but also remove all the
unreasonable restrictions in earlier approaches (e.g. Batch-Constrained Deep
Q-Learning). In the further, we will demonstrate that the LR, is able to learn
robustly from different offline datasets, including random and suboptimal
demonstrations, on a range of practical control tasks.</span>

sustained operation of any e-commerce business. Machine learning (ML) often
plays an important role in these anti-fraud operations, but the organizational
context in which these ML models operate cannot be ignored. In this paper, we
take an organization-centric view on the topic of fraud detection by
formulating an operational model of the anti-fraud departments in e-commerce
organizations. We derive 6 research topics and 12 practical challenges for
fraud detection from this operational model. We summarize the state of the
literature for each research topic, discuss potential solutions to the
practical challenges, and identify 22 open research challenges.</span>

applied in a variety of domains such as security and surveillance, human-robot

papers have been published, there is a lack of HAR overview papers focusing on
healthcare applications that use wearable sensors. Therefore, we fill in the
gap by presenting this overview paper. In particular, we present our projects
to illustrate the system design of HAR applications for healthcare. Our
projects include early mobility identification of human activities for
intensive care unit (ICU) patients and gait analysis of Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD) patients. We cover essential components of designing HAR
systems including sensor factors (e.g., type, number, and placement location),
AI model selection (e.g., classical machine learning models versus deep
learning models), and feature engineering. In addition, we highlight the
challenges of such healthcare-oriented HAR systems and propose several research

and surgical planning. While voxel-based deep learning frameworks have been
proposed for this segmentation task, their performance remains limited. In this
study, we offer a two-step surface-based deep learning pipeline that achieves
significantly higher performance. Our proposed model takes a surface model of
entire principal brain arteries containing aneurysms as input and returns
aneurysms surfaces as output. A user first generates a surface model by
manually specifying multiple thresholds for time-of-flight magnetic resonance
angiography images. The system then samples small surface fragments from the
entire brain arteries and classifies the surface fragments according to whether
aneurysms are present using a point-based deep learning network (PointNet++).
Finally, the system applies surface segmentation (SO-Net) to surface fragments
containing aneurysms. We conduct a direct comparison of segmentation
performance by counting voxels between the proposed surface-based framework and
the existing voxel-based method, in which our framework achieves a much higher
dice similarity coefficient score (72%) than the prior approach (46%).</span>

                                        <span>Supervised learning, while deployed in real-life scenarios, often encounters
instances of unknown classes. Conventional algorithms for training a supervised
learning model do not provide an option to detect such instances, so they
miss-classify such instances with 100% probability. Open Set Recognition (OSR)
and Non-Exhaustive Learning (NEL) are potential solutions to overcome this
problem. Most existing methods of OSR first classify members of existing
classes and then identify instances of new classes. However, many of the
existing methods of OSR only makes a binary decision, i.e., they only identify
the existence of the unknown class. Hence, such methods cannot distinguish test
instances belonging to incremental unseen classes. On the other hand, the
majority of NEL methods often make a parametric assumption over the data
distribution, which either fail to return good results, due to the reason that
real-life complex datasets may not follow a well-known data distribution. In
this paper, we propose a new online non-exhaustive learning model, namely,
Non-Exhaustive Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks (NE-GM-GAN) to
address these issues. Our proposed model synthesizes Gaussian mixture based
latent representation over a deep generative model, such as GAN, for
incremental detection of instances of emerging classes in the test data.
Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that
NE-GM-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting
instances of novel classes in streaming data.</span>

train with live market data while making decisions on the fly, deep
reinforcement learning algorithms are especially effective in taking such
pricing decisions. In e-commerce scenarios, multiple reinforcement learning
agents can set prices based on their competitor&#x27;s prices. Therefore, research
states that agents might end up in a state of collusion in the long run. To
further analyze this issue, we build a scenario that is based on a modified

scissors. Our results indicate that the action selection can be dissected into
specific stages, establishing the possibility to develop collusion prevention
systems that are able to recognize situations which might lead to a collusion

various nontrivial tasks such as reading novels, playing games or solving
maths. As the ultimate goal of machine learning is to derive intelligent
systems that learn and act automatically just like human, memory construction
for machine is inevitable. Artificial neural networks model neurons and
synapses in the brain by interconnecting computational units via weights, which
is a typical class of machine learning algorithms that resembles memory
structure. Their descendants with more complicated modeling techniques (a.k.a
deep learning) have been successfully applied to many practical problems and
demonstrated the importance of memory in the learning process of machinery
systems. Recent progresses on modeling memory in deep learning have revolved
around external memory constructions, which are highly inspired by
computational Turing models and biological neuronal systems. Attention
mechanisms are derived to support acquisition and retention operations on the
external memory. Despite the lack of theoretical foundations, these approaches
have shown promises to help machinery systems reach a higher level of
intelligence. The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding on memory
and attention in deep learning. Its contributions include: (i) presenting a
collection of taxonomies for memory, (ii) constructing new memory-augmented
neural networks (MANNs) that support multiple control and memory units, (iii)
introducing variability via memory in sequential generative models, (iv)
searching for optimal writing operations to maximise the memorisation capacity
in slot-based memory networks, and (v) simulating the Universal Turing Machine

performance for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) across several
tasks. Addressing overconfidence in such models, in this paper we introduce the
concept of relaxed attention, which is a simple gradual injection of a uniform
distribution to the encoder-decoder attention weights during training that is
easily implemented with two lines of code. We investigate the effect of relaxed
attention across different AED model architectures and two prominent ASR tasks,
Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Librispeech. We found that transformers trained
with relaxed attention outperform the standard baseline models consistently
during decoding with external language models. On WSJ, we set a new benchmark
for transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition with a word error rate of
3.65%, outperforming state of the art (4.20%) by 13.1% relative, while
introducing only a single hyperparameter. Upon acceptance, models will be
published on github.</span>

which disseminate among mammals and others cause sickness among humans.
COVID-19 is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading, rendering its early
diagnosis of preeminent status. Researchers, medical specialists and
organizations all over the globe have been working tirelessly to combat this
virus and help in its containment. In this paper, a novel neural network called
WisdomNet has been proposed, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-rays.
The WisdomNet uses the concept of Wisdom of Crowds as its founding idea. It is
a two-layered convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes chest x-ray
images as input. Both layers of the proposed neural network consist of a number
of neural networks each. The dataset used for this study consists of chest
x-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients, compiled and shared by Dr. Cohen on
GitHub, and the chest x-ray images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by viral
and bacterial pneumonia were obtained from Kaggle. The network not only
pinpoints the presence of COVID-19, but also gives the probability of the
disease maturing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus,
predicting the progression of the disease in the COVID-19 positive patients.
The network also slender the occurrences of false negative cases by employing a
high threshold value, thus aids in curbing the spread of the disease and gives
an accuracy of 100% for successfully predicting COVID-19 among the chest x-rays
of patients affected with COVID-19, bacterial and viral pneumonia.</span>

                                        <span>Subtype Discovery consists in finding interpretable and consistent sub-parts
of a dataset, which are also relevant to a certain supervised task. From a
mathematical point of view, this can be defined as a clustering task driven by
supervised learning in order to uncover subgroups in line with the supervised
prediction. In this paper, we propose a general Expectation-Maximization
ensemble framework entitled UCSL (Unsupervised Clustering driven by Supervised
Learning). Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and
can be driven by both binary classification and regression. We propose to
construct a non-linear model by merging multiple linear estimators, one per
cluster. Each hyperplane is estimated so that it correctly discriminates - or
predict - only one cluster. We use SVC or Logistic Regression for
classification and SVR for regression. Furthermore, to perform cluster analysis
within a more suitable space, we also propose a dimension-reduction algorithm
that projects the data onto an orthonormal space relevant to the supervised
task. We analyze the robustness and generalization capability of our algorithm
using synthetic and experimental datasets. In particular, we validate its
ability to identify suitable consistent sub-types by conducting a
psychiatric-diseases cluster analysis with known ground-truth labels. The gain
of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art techniques is about +1.9
points in terms of balanced accuracy. Finally, we make codes and examples

when data are generated from a Gaussian, linear structural equation model. It
consists of two parts: (1) introduce a permutation matrix as a new parameter
within a regularized Gaussian log-likelihood to represent variable ordering;
and (2) given the ordering, estimate the DAG structure through sparse Cholesky
factor of the inverse covariance matrix. For permutation matrix estimation, we
propose a relaxation technique that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial problem of
order estimation. Given an ordering, a sparse Cholesky factor is estimated
using a cyclic coordinatewise descent algorithm which decouples row-wise. Our
framework recovers DAGs without the need for an expensive verification of the
acyclicity constraint or enumeration of possible parent sets. We establish
numerical convergence of the algorithm, and consistency of the Cholesky factor
estimator when the order of variables is known. Through several simulated and

                                        <span>Person re-identification (Re-ID) via gait features within 3D skeleton
sequences is a newly-emerging topic with several advantages. Existing solutions
either rely on hand-crafted descriptors or supervised gait representation
learning. This paper proposes a self-supervised gait encoding approach that can
leverage unlabeled skeleton data to learn gait representations for person
Re-ID. Specifically, we first create self-supervision by learning to
reconstruct unlabeled skeleton sequences reversely, which involves richer
high-level semantics to obtain better gait representations. Other pretext tasks
are also explored to further improve self-supervised learning. Second, inspired
by the fact that motion&#x27;s continuity endows adjacent skeletons in one skeleton
sequence and temporally consecutive skeleton sequences with higher correlations
(referred as locality in 3D skeleton data), we propose a locality-aware
attention mechanism and a locality-aware contrastive learning scheme, which aim
to preserve locality-awareness on intra-sequence level and inter-sequence level
respectively during self-supervised learning. Last, with context vectors
learned by our locality-aware attention mechanism and contrastive learning
scheme, a novel feature named Constrastive Attention-based Gait Encodings
(CAGEs) is designed to represent gait effectively. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based counterparts by
15-40% Rank-1 accuracy, and it even achieves superior performance to numerous
multi-modal methods with extra RGB or depth information. Our codes are
available at https://github.com/Kali-Hac/Locality-Awareness-SGE.</span>

                                        <span>Breakthrough advances in reinforcement learning (RL) research have led to a
surge in the development and application of RL. To support the field and its
rapid growth, several frameworks have emerged that aim to help the community
more easily build effective and scalable agents. However, very few of these
frameworks exclusively support multi-agent RL (MARL), an increasingly active
field in itself, concerned with decentralised decision-making problems. In this
work, we attempt to fill this gap by presenting Mava: a research framework
specifically designed for building scalable MARL systems. Mava provides useful
components, abstractions, utilities and tools for MARL and allows for simple
scaling for multi-process system training and execution, while providing a high
level of flexibility and composability. Mava is built on top of DeepMind&#x27;s Acme
\citep{hoffman2020acme}, and therefore integrates with, and greatly benefits
from, a wide range of already existing single-agent RL components made
available in Acme. Several MARL baseline systems have already been implemented
in Mava. These implementations serve as examples showcasing Mava&#x27;s reusable
features, such as interchangeable system architectures, communication and
mixing modules. Furthermore, these implementations allow existing MARL
algorithms to be easily reproduced and extended. We provide experimental
results for these implementations on a wide range of multi-agent environments
and highlight the benefits of distributed system training.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation uses both real hard labels and soft labels predicted
by teacher models as supervision. Intuitively, we expect the soft labels and
hard labels to be concordant w.r.t. their orders of probabilities. However, we
found {\it critical order violations} between hard labels and soft labels in
augmented samples. For example, for an augmented sample $x&#x3D;0.7*panda+0.3*cat$,
we expect the order of meaningful soft labels to be
$P_\text{soft}(panda|x)&gt;P_\text{soft}(cat|x)&gt;P_\text{soft}(other|x)$. But real
soft labels usually violate the order, e.g.
$P_\text{soft}(tiger|x)&gt;P_\text{soft}(panda|x)&gt;P_\text{soft}(cat|x)$. We
attribute this to the unsatisfactory generalization ability of the teacher,
which leads to the prediction error of augmented samples. Empirically, we found
the violations are common and injure the knowledge transfer.In this paper, we
introduce order restrictions to data augmentation for knowledge distillation,
which is denoted as isotonic data augmentation (IDA). We use isotonic
regression (IR) -- a classic technique from statistics -- to eliminate the
order violations. We show that IDA can be modeled as a tree-structured IR
problem. We thereby adapt the classical IRT-BIN algorithm for optimal solutions
with $O(c \log c)$ time complexity, where $c$ is the number of labels. In order
to further reduce the time complexity, we also \cwy{propose} a GPU-friendly
approximation with linear time complexity. We have verified on variant datasets
and data augmentation techniques that our proposed IDA algorithms effectively
increases the accuracy of knowledge distillation by eliminating the rank
violations.</span>

modeling user behavior and preferences using short-term anonymous sessions.
Existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate and
aggregate information from neighboring nodes i.e., local message passing. Such
graph-based architectures have representational limits, as a single sub-graph
is susceptible to overfit the sequential dependencies instead of accounting for
complex transitions between items in different sessions. We propose using a
Transformer in combination with a target attentive GNN, which allows richer
Representation Learning. Our experimental results and ablation show that our

experiment ever built. Its main objective is to detect the gravitational wave
from the strongest events in the universe by observing if the length of its
4-kilometer arms change by a distance 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of
a proton. Due to its sensitivity, LIGO is prone to the disturbance of external
noises which affects the data being collected to detect the gravitational wave.
These noises are commonly called by the LIGO community as glitches. The
objective of this study is to evaluate the effeciency of various deep trasnfer
learning models namely VGG19, ResNet50V2, VGG16 and ResNet101 to detect glitch
waveform in gravitational wave data. The accuracy achieved by the said models
are 98.98%, 98.35%, 97.56% and 94.73% respectively. Even though the models
achieved fairly high accuracy, it is observed that all of the model suffered
from the lack of data for certain classes which is the main concern found in

data points which are bijectively mapped to a (possibly) lower dimensional
space where an equivalent random cluster model is used to calculate the
expected number of modes to be found when separating the data of a multi-modal
data set into distinct clusters. Furthermore, as a function of the expected
number of modes and the number of data points in the sample, an upper bound on
a given distance measure is found such that data points have the greatest
correlation if their mutual distances from a common center is less than or
equal to the calculated bound. Anomalies are exposed, which lie outside of the
union of all regularized clusters of data points. Finally, similarly to finding
a hyperplane which can be shifted along its normal to expose the maximal
distance between binary classes, it is shown that the union of regularized

recently demonstrated state-of-the-art results for numerous tasks. However, the
application of self-attention and attention-based encoder-decoder models
remains challenging for streaming ASR, where each word must be recognized
shortly after it was spoken. In this work, we present the dual
causal/non-causal self-attention (DCN) architecture, which in contrast to
restricted self-attention prevents the overall context to grow beyond the
look-ahead of a single layer when used in a deep architecture. DCN is compared
to chunk-based and restricted self-attention using streaming transformer and
conformer architectures, showing improved ASR performance over restricted
self-attention and competitive ASR results compared to chunk-based
self-attention, while providing the advantage of frame-synchronous processing.
Combined with triggered attention, the proposed streaming end-to-end ASR
systems obtained state-of-the-art results on the LibriSpeech, HKUST, and
Switchboard ASR tasks.</span>

of optimization for the neural networks, most existing theories on
over-parameterization do not fully explain the reason -- they either work in
the Neural Tangent Kernel regime where neurons don&#x27;t move much, or require an
enormous number of neurons. In practice, when the data is generated using a
teacher neural network, even mildly over-parameterized neural networks can
achieve 0 loss and recover the directions of teacher neurons. In this paper we
develop a local convergence theory for mildly over-parameterized two-layer
neural net. We show that as long as the loss is already lower than a threshold
(polynomial in relevant parameters), all student neurons in an
over-parameterized two-layer neural network will converge to one of teacher
neurons, and the loss will go to 0. Our result holds for any number of student
neurons as long as it is at least as large as the number of teacher neurons,
and our convergence rate is independent of the number of student neurons. A key
component of our analysis is the new characterization of local optimization
landscape -- we show the gradient satisfies a special case of Lojasiewicz
property which is different from local strong convexity or PL conditions used
in previous work.</span>

learning (RL), in this paper we propose a novel uncertainty-aware model-based
RL (UA-MBRL) framework, and then implement and validate it in autonomous
driving under various task scenarios. First, an action-conditioned ensemble
model with the ability of uncertainty assessment is established as the virtual
environment model. Then, a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL framework is
developed based on the adaptive truncation approach, providing virtual
interactions between the agent and environment model, and improving RL&#x27;s
training efficiency and performance. The developed algorithms are then
implemented in end-to-end autonomous vehicle control tasks, validated and

validation results suggest that the proposed UA-MBRL method surpasses the

                                        <span>Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of
privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms
without external noise as non-private [Dwork et al., 2014], and external
noises, such as Gaussian noise or Laplacian noise [Dwork et al., 2006], are
introduced to improve privacy. In many real-world applications, however, adding
external noise is undesirable and sometimes prohibited. For example,
presidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et
al., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction
accuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes
[Bagdasaryan et al., 2019].

In this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following
the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman
and Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the
privacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings.

We prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including
composability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any
discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP
predicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures
are still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that
the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we
apply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates
some neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises. We believe
that these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic
privacy measures beyond worst-case analysis.</span>

a crucial task undertaken by medical institutions. Although numerous flu
forecasting methods and models based mainly on historical flu activity data and
online user-generated contents have been proposed in previous studies, no flu
forecasting model targeting multiple countries using two types of data exists
at present. Our paper leverages multi-task learning to tackle the challenge of
building one flu forecasting model targeting multiple countries; each country
as each task. Also, to develop the flu prediction model with higher
performance, we solved two issues; finding suitable search queries, which are
part of the user-generated contents, and how to leverage search queries
efficiently in the model creation. For the first issue, we propose the transfer
approaches from English to other languages. For the second issue, we propose a
novel flu forecasting model that takes advantage of search queries using an
attention mechanism and extend the model to a multi-task model for multiple
countries&#x27; flu forecasts. Experiments on forecasting flu epidemics in five
countries demonstrate that our model significantly improved the performance by
leveraging the search queries and multi-task learning compared to the

                                        <span>The lack of explainability is one of the most prominent disadvantages of deep
learning applications in omics. This &quot;black box&quot; problem can undermine the
credibility and limit the practical implementation of biomedical deep learning
models. Here we present XOmiVAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) based
interpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using
high-dimensional omics data. XOmiVAE is capable of revealing the contribution
of each gene and latent dimension for each classification prediction, and the
correlation between each gene and each latent dimension. It is also
demonstrated that XOmiVAE can explain not only the supervised classification
but the unsupervised clustering results from the deep learning network. To the
best of our knowledge, XOmiVAE is one of the first activation level-based
interpretable deep learning models explaining novel clusters generated by VAE.
The explainable results generated by XOmiVAE were validated by both the
performance of downstream tasks and the biomedical knowledge. In our
experiments, XOmiVAE explanations of deep learning based cancer classification
and clustering aligned with current domain knowledge including biological
annotation and academic literature, which shows great potential for novel
biomedical knowledge discovery from deep learning models.</span>

that does not require to deal with n-dimensional data in n-dimensional space.
It allows discovering n-D patterns in 2-D space without loss of n-D information
using graph representations of n-D data in 2-D. Specifically, it can be done
with the inline based coordinates in different modifications, including static
and dynamic ones. The classification and regression algorithms based on these
inline coordinates were introduced. A successful case study based on a
benchmark data demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. This approach
helps to consolidate further a whole new area of full 2-D machine learning as a
promising ML methodology. It has advantages of abilities to involve actively
the end-users into the discovering of models and their justification. Another
advantage is providing interpretable ML models.</span>

EnSemble), a new method for unsupervised outlier detection (UOD). More
precisely, given any autoencoder for UOD, this technique can be used to improve
its accuracy while at the same time removing the burden of tuning its
regularization. The idea is to not regularize at all, but to rather randomly
partition the data into sufficiently many equally sized parts, overfit each
part with its own autoencoder, and to use the maximum over all autoencoder
reconstruction errors as the anomaly score. We apply our model to various
realistic datasets and show that if the set of inliers is dense enough, our
method indeed improves the UOD performance of a given autoencoder
significantly. For reproducibility, the code is made available on github so the
reader can recreate the results in this paper as well as apply the method to

                                        <span>Quantization based model compression serves as high performing and fast
approach for inference that yields highly compressed models compared to their
full-precision floating point counterparts. The most extreme quantization is a
1-bit representation of parameters such that they have only two possible
values, typically -1(0) or +1. Models that constrain the weights to binary
values enable efficient implementation of the ubiquitous dot product by
additions only without requiring floating point multiplications which is
beneficial for resources constrained inference. The main contribution of this
work is the introduction of a method to smooth the combinatorial problem of
determining a binary vector of weights to minimize the expected loss for a
given objective by means of empirical risk minimization with backpropagation.
This is achieved by approximating a multivariate binary state over the weights
utilizing a deterministic and differentiable transformation of real-valued
continuous parameters. The proposed method adds little overhead in training,
can be readily applied without any substantial modifications to the original
architecture, does not introduce additional saturating non-linearities or
auxiliary losses, and does not prohibit applying other methods for binarizing
the activations. It is demonstrated that contrary to common assertions made in
the literature, binary weighted networks can train well with the same standard
optimization techniques and similar hyperparameters settings as their
full-precision counterparts, namely momentum SGD with large learning rates and
$L_2$ regularization. The source code is publicly available at

                                        <span>Granular sound synthesis is a popular audio generation technique based on
rearranging sequences of small waveform windows. In order to control the
synthesis, all grains in a given corpus are analyzed through a set of acoustic
descriptors. This provides a representation reflecting some form of local
similarities across the grains. However, the quality of this grain space is
bound by that of the descriptors. Its traversal is not continuously invertible
to signal and does not render any structured temporality.

We demonstrate that generative neural networks can implement granular
synthesis while alleviating most of its shortcomings. We efficiently replace
its audio descriptor basis by a probabilistic latent space learned with a
Variational Auto-Encoder. In this setting the learned grain space is
invertible, meaning that we can continuously synthesize sound when traversing
its dimensions. It also implies that original grains are not stored for
synthesis. Another major advantage of our approach is to learn structured paths
inside this latent space by training a higher-level temporal embedding over
arranged grain sequences.

The model can be applied to many types of libraries, including pitched notes
or unpitched drums and environmental noises. We report experiments on the
common granular synthesis processes as well as novel ones such as conditional
sampling and morphing.</span>

                                        <span>Despite their practical success, modern seq2seq architectures are unable to
generalize systematically on several SCAN tasks. Hence, it is not clear if
SCAN-style compositional generalization is useful in realistic NLP tasks. In
this work, we study the benefit that such compositionality brings about to
several machine translation tasks. We present several focused modifications of
Transformer that greatly improve generalization capabilities on SCAN and select
one that remains on par with a vanilla Transformer on a standard machine
translation (MT) task. Next, we study its performance in low-resource settings
and on a newly introduced distribution-shifted English-French translation task.
Overall, we find that improvements of a SCAN-capable model do not directly
transfer to the resource-rich MT setup. In contrast, in the low-resource setup,
general modifications lead to an improvement of up to 13.1% BLEU score w.r.t. a
vanilla Transformer. Similarly, an improvement of 14% in an accuracy-based
metric is achieved in the introduced compositional English-French translation
task. This provides experimental evidence that the compositional generalization
assessed in SCAN is particularly useful in resource-starved and domain-shifted
scenarios.</span>

anomalies in the maritime domain. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based
traffic representation and association scheme to cluster trajectories of
vessels using automatic identification system (AIS) data. We utilize the
(un)clustered data to train a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential
regression model, which can predict a vessel&#x27;s trajectory at future timesteps
with its corresponding prediction uncertainty. This paper proposes the usage of
a deep learning (DL)-based uncertainty estimation in detecting maritime
anomalies, such as unusual vessel maneuvering. Furthermore, we utilize the
evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the
loss of AIS signal using predicted class probabilities with associated
uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that using graph-based
clustered data improves the ability of the DL models to learn the
temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using
different AIS datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated
prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of
traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.</span>

work, a neural network computing framework, i.e., a spatiotemporal
convolutional network (STCN), was developed to efficiently and accurately
render a multistep-ahead prediction of a time series by employing a
spatial-temporal information (STI) transformation. The STCN combines the
advantages of both the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the STI
equation, which maps the high-dimensional/spatial data to the future temporal
values of a target variable, thus naturally providing the prediction of the
target variable. From the observed variables, the STCN also infers the causal
factors of the target variable in the sense of Granger causality, which are in
turn selected as effective spatial information to improve the prediction
robustness. The STCN was successfully applied to both benchmark systems and
real-world datasets, all of which show superior and robust performance in
multistep-ahead prediction, even when the data were perturbed by noise. From
both theoretical and computational viewpoints, the STCN has great potential in
practical applications in artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning
fields as a model-free method based only on the observed data, and also opens a
new way to explore the observed high-dimensional data in a dynamical manner for
machine learning.</span>

domains that require high sample efficiencies, such as Go and robotics.
However, there are some remaining issues, such as planning efficient
explorations to learn more accurate dynamic models, evaluating the uncertainty
of the learned models, and more rational utilization of models. To mitigate
these issues, we present MEEE, a model-ensemble method that consists of
optimistic exploration and weighted exploitation. During exploration, unlike
prior methods directly selecting the optimal action that maximizes the expected
accumulative return, our agent first generates a set of action candidates and
then seeks out the optimal action that takes both expected return and future
observation novelty into account. During exploitation, different discounted
weights are assigned to imagined transition tuples according to their model
uncertainty respectively, which will prevent model predictive error propagation
in agent training. Experiments on several challenging continuous control
benchmark tasks demonstrated that our approach outperforms other model-free and
model-based state-of-the-art methods, especially in sample complexity.</span>

missing values in multi-relational data. We tackle this problem within the
probabilistic logic programming framework of Distributional Clauses (DC), which
supports both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Within this
framework, we introduce DiceML { an approach to learn both the structure and
the parameters of DC programs from relational data (with possibly missing
data). To realize this, DiceML integrates statistical modeling and
distributional clauses with rule learning. The distinguishing features of
DiceML are that it 1) tackles autocompletion in relational data, 2) learns
distributional clauses extended with statistical models, 3) deals with both
discrete and continuous distributions, 4) can exploit background knowledge, and
5) uses an expectation-maximization based algorithm to cope with missing data.
The empirical results show the promise of the approach, even when there is

                                        <span>A butterfly network consists of logarithmically many layers, each with a
linear number of non-zero weights (pre-specified). The fast
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform (FJLT) can be represented as a butterfly
network followed by a projection onto a random subset of the coordinates.
Moreover, a random matrix based on FJLT with high probability approximates the
action of any matrix on a vector. Motivated by these facts, we propose to
replace a dense linear layer in any neural network by an architecture based on
the butterfly network. The proposed architecture significantly improves upon
the quadratic number of weights required in a standard dense layer to nearly
linear with little compromise in expressibility of the resulting operator. In a
collection of wide variety of experiments, including supervised prediction on
both the NLP and vision data, we show that this not only produces results that
match and at times outperform existing well-known architectures, but it also
offers faster training and prediction in deployment. To understand the
optimization problems posed by neural networks with a butterfly network, we
also study the optimization landscape of the encoder-decoder network, where the
encoder is replaced by a butterfly network followed by a dense linear layer in
smaller dimension. Theoretical result presented in the paper explains why the
training speed and outcome are not compromised by our proposed approach.</span>

general patterns present in the dataset. Several conceptualizations exist to
distinguish between different types of anomalies. However, these are either too
specific to be generally applicable or so abstract that they neither provide
concrete insight into the nature of anomaly types nor facilitate the functional
evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms. With the recent criticism on &#x27;black

situation. This paper therefore introduces a general typology of anomalies that
offers a clear and tangible definition of the different types of anomalies in
datasets. The typology also facilitates the evaluation of the functional
capabilities of anomaly detection algorithms and as a framework assists in
analyzing the conceptual levels of data, patterns and anomalies. Finally, it
serves as an analytical tool for studying anomaly types from other typologies.</span>

in a continual learning setting. As the environment changes, the aim is to
efficiently compress the sensory state&#x27;s information without losing past
knowledge, and then use Reinforcement Learning on the resulting features for
efficient policy learning. To this end, we propose S-TRIGGER, a general method
for Continual State Representation Learning applicable to Variational
Auto-Encoders and its many variants. The method is based on Generative Replay,
i.e. the use of generated samples to maintain past knowledge. It comes along
with a statistically sound method for environment change detection, which
self-triggers the Generative Replay. Our experiments on VAEs show that
S-TRIGGER learns state representations that allows fast and high-performing
Reinforcement Learning, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The resulting
system is capable of autonomously learning new information without using past

introduction of ConvNets. However, on very constrained hardware the time
necessary to train such models would be high. Our main contribution is twofold.
First, we extensively test an end-to-end vanilla neural network (MLP) approach
in pure numpy without any pre-processing or feature extraction done beforehand.
Second, we show that basic data mining operations can significantly improve the
performance of the models in terms of computational time, without sacrificing
much accuracy. We illustrate our claims on a simpler variant of the Extended
MNIST dataset, called Balanced EMNIST dataset. Our experiments show that,
without any data mining, we get increased generalization performance when using
more hidden layers and regularization techniques, the best model achieving
84.83% accuracy on a test dataset. Using dimensionality reduction done by PCA
we were able to increase that figure to 85.08% with only 10% of the original
feature space, reducing the memory size needed by 64%. Finally, adding methods
to remove possibly harmful training samples like deviation from the mean helped
us to still achieve over 84% test accuracy but with only 32.8% of the original
memory size for the training set. This compares favorably to the majority of
literature results obtained through similar architectures. Although this
approach gets outshined by state-of-the-art models, it does scale to some
(AlexNet, VGGNet) trained on 50% of the same dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Constrained motion planning is a challenging field of research, aiming for
computationally efficient methods that can find a collision-free path on the
constraint manifolds between a given start and goal configuration. These
planning problems come up surprisingly frequently, such as in robot
manipulation for performing daily life assistive tasks. However, few solutions
to constrained motion planning are available, and those that exist struggle
with high computational time complexity in finding a path solution on the
manifolds. To address this challenge, we present Constrained Motion Planning
Networks X (CoMPNetX). It is a neural planning approach, comprising a
conditional deep neural generator and discriminator with neural gradients-based
fast projection operator. We also introduce neural task and scene
representations conditioned on which the CoMPNetX generates implicit manifold
configurations to turbo-charge any underlying classical planner such as
Sampling-based Motion Planning methods for quickly solving complex constrained
planning tasks. We show that our method finds path solutions with high success
rates and lower computation times than state-of-the-art traditional
path-finding tools on various challenging scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Learning with graphs has attracted significant attention recently. Existing
representation learning methods on graphs have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on various graph-related tasks such as node classification, link
prediction, etc. However, we observe that these methods could leak serious
private information. For instance, one can accurately infer the links (or node
identity) in a graph from a node classifier (or link predictor) trained on the
learnt node representations by existing methods. To address the issue, we
propose a privacy-preserving representation learning framework on graphs from
the \emph{mutual information} perspective. Specifically, our framework includes
a primary learning task and a privacy protection task, and we consider node
classification and link prediction as the two tasks of interest. Our goal is to
learn node representations such that they can be used to achieve high
performance for the primary learning task, while obtaining performance for the
privacy protection task close to random guessing. We formally formulate our
goal via mutual information objectives. However, it is intractable to compute
mutual information in practice. Then, we derive tractable variational bounds
for the mutual information terms, where each bound can be parameterized via a
neural network. Next, we train these parameterized neural networks to
approximate the true mutual information and learn privacy-preserving node
representations. We finally evaluate our framework on various graph datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) is an approach for computing ground-state
wavefunctions that has recently become more powerful due to the introduction of
neural network-based wavefunction parametrizations. However, efficiently
training neural wavefunctions to converge to an energy minimum remains a
difficult problem. In this work, we analyze optimization and sampling methods
used in VMC and introduce alterations to improve their performance. First,
based on theoretical convergence analysis in a noiseless setting, we motivate a
new optimizer that we call the Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton method, which can improve
upon gradient descent and natural gradient descent to achieve superlinear
convergence with little added computational cost. Second, in order to realize
this favorable comparison in the presence of stochastic noise, we analyze the
effect of sampling error on VMC parameter updates and experimentally
demonstrate that it can be reduced by the parallel tempering method. In
particular, we demonstrate that RGN can be made robust to energy spikes that
occur when new regions of configuration space become available to the sampler
over the course of optimization. Finally, putting theory into practice, we
apply our enhanced optimization and sampling methods to the transverse-field
Ising and XXZ models on large lattices, yielding ground-state energy estimates
with remarkably high accuracy after just 200-500 parameter updates.</span>

                                        <span>Recently years have witnessed a growing list of systems for distributed
data-parallel training. Existing systems largely fit into two paradigms, i.e.,
parameter server and MPI-style collective operations. On the algorithmic side,
researchers have proposed a wide range of techniques to lower the communication
via system relaxations: quantization, decentralization, and communication
delay. However, most, if not all, existing systems only rely on standard
synchronous and asynchronous stochastic gradient (SG) based optimization,
therefore, cannot take advantage of all possible optimizations that the machine
learning community has been developing recently. Given this emerging gap
between the current landscapes of systems and theory, we build BAGUA, a
communication framework whose design goal is to provide a system abstraction
that is both flexible and modular to support state-of-the-art system relaxation
techniques of distributed training. Powered by the new system design, BAGUA has
a great ability to implement and extend various state-of-the-art distributed
learning algorithms. In a production cluster with up to 16 machines (128 GPUs),
BAGUA can outperform PyTorch-DDP, Horovod and BytePS in the end-to-end training
time by a significant margin (up to 1.95 times) across a diverse range of
tasks. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous tradeoff exploration showing that
different algorithms and system relaxations achieve the best performance over
different network conditions.</span>

high-dimensional input parameters and/or an intractable likelihood. Performing
Bayesian parameter inference in this context can be challenging. We present a
neural simulator-based inference algorithm which simultaneously offers
simulation efficiency and fast empirical posterior testability, which is unique
among modern algorithms. Our approach is simulation efficient by simultaneously
estimating low-dimensional marginal posteriors instead of the joint posterior
and by proposing simulations targeted to an observation of interest via a prior
suitably truncated by an indicator function. Furthermore, by estimating a
locally amortized posterior our algorithm enables efficient empirical tests of
the robustness of the inference results. Such tests are important for
sanity-checking inference in real-world applications, which do not feature a
known ground truth. We perform experiments on a marginalized version of the
simulation-based inference benchmark and two complex and narrow posteriors,
highlighting the simulator efficiency of our algorithm as well as the quality
of the estimated marginal posteriors. Implementation on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Data augmentation has recently seen increased interest in NLP due to more
work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale
neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this
recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the
challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by
summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and
motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically
representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for
popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges
and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the
landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate
additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper

                                        <span>Differential privacy is a restriction on data processing algorithms that
provides strong confidentiality guarantees for individual records in the data.
However, research on proper statistical inference, that is, research on
properly quantifying the uncertainty of the (noisy) sample estimate regarding
the true value in the population, is currently still limited. This paper
proposes and evaluates several strategies to compute valid differentially
private confidence intervals for the median. Instead of computing a
differentially private point estimate and deriving its uncertainty, we directly
estimate the interval bounds and discuss why this approach is superior if
ensuring privacy is important. We also illustrate that addressing both sources
of uncertainty--the error from sampling and the error from protecting the
output--simultaneously should be preferred over simpler approaches that
incorporate the uncertainty in a sequential fashion. We evaluate the
performance of the different algorithms under various parameter settings in
extensive simulation studies and demonstrate how the findings could be applied
in practical settings using data from the 1940 Decennial Census.</span>

order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural
networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along
with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these
architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data
augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we
propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption
robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more
robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that
vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more
shape bias. Our code is available to reproduce.</span>

uncertainty caused by the inaccessibility of target domain data. In this paper,
we address both challenges with a probabilistic framework based on variational
Bayesian inference, by incorporating uncertainty into neural network weights.
We couple domain invariance in a probabilistic formula with the variational
Bayesian inference. This enables us to explore domain-invariant learning in a
principled way. Specifically, we derive domain-invariant representations and
classifiers, which are jointly established in a two-layer Bayesian neural
network. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on four
widely used cross-domain visual recognition benchmarks. Ablation studies
validate the synergistic benefits of our Bayesian treatment when jointly
learning domain-invariant representations and classifiers for domain
generalization. Further, our method consistently delivers state-of-the-art mean
accuracy on all benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning in large-scale environments is challenging due to the
many possible actions that can be taken in specific situations. We have
previously developed a means of constraining, and hence speeding up, the search
process through the use of motion primitives; motion primitives are sequences
of pre-specified actions taken across a state series. As a byproduct of this
work, we have found that if the motion primitives&#x27; motions and actions are
labeled, then the search can be sped up further. Since motion primitives may
initially lack such details, we propose a theoretically viewpoint-insensitive
and speed-insensitive means of automatically annotating the underlying motions
and actions. We do this through a differential-geometric, spatio-temporal
kinematics descriptor, which analyzes how the poses of entities in two motion
sequences change over time. We use this descriptor in conjunction with a
weighted-nearest-neighbor classifier to label the primitives using a limited
set of training examples. In our experiments, we achieve high motion and action
annotation rates for human-action-derived primitives with as few as one
training sample. We also demonstrate that reinforcement learning using
accurately labeled trajectories leads to high-performing policies more quickly
than standard reinforcement learning techniques. This is partly because motion
primitives encode prior domain knowledge and preempt the need to re-discover
that knowledge during training. It is also because agents can leverage the
labels to systematically ignore action classes that do not facilitate task
objectives, thereby reducing the action space.</span>

mechanism to efficiently extract information from the encoder. While it is
common practice to draw information from only the last encoder layer, recent
work has proposed to use representations from different encoder layers for
diversified levels of information. Nonetheless, the decoder still obtains only
a single view of the source sequences, which might lead to insufficient
training of the encoder layer stack due to the hierarchy bypassing problem. In
this work, we propose layer-wise cross-view decoding, where for each decoder
layer, together with the representations from the last encoder layer, which
serve as a global view, those from other encoder layers are supplemented for a
stereoscopic view of the source sequences. Systematic experiments show that we
successfully address the hierarchy bypassing problem and substantially improve
the performance of sequence-to-sequence learning with deep representations on
diverse tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a recently proposed neural
architecture search (NAS) method based on a differentiable relaxation. Due to
its success, numerous variants analyzing and improving parts of the DARTS
framework have recently been proposed. By considering the problem as a
constrained bilevel optimization, we propose and analyze three improvements to
architectural weight competition, update scheduling, and regularization towards
discretization. First, we introduce a new approach to the activation of
architecture weights, which prevents confounding competition within an edge and
allows for fair comparison across edges to aid in discretization. Next, we
propose a dynamic schedule based on per-minibatch network information to make
architecture updates more informed. Finally, we consider two regularizations,
based on proximity to discretization and the Alternating Directions Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, to promote early discretization. Our results show
that this new activation scheme reduces final architecture size and the
regularizations improve reliability in search results while maintaining
comparable performance to state-of-the-art in NAS, especially when used with
our new dynamic informed schedule.</span>

neural networks of any architecture correspond to Gaussian processes referred
to as $\mathrm{NNGP}$. While these works have extended the class of neural
networks converging to Gaussian processes significantly, however, there has
been little focus on broadening the class of stochastic processes that such
neural networks converge to. In this work, inspired by the scale mixture of
Gaussian random variables, we propose the scale mixture of $\mathrm{NNGP}$ for
which we introduce a prior distribution on the scale of the last-layer
parameters. We show that simply introducing a scale prior on the last-layer
parameters can turn infinitely-wide neural networks of any architecture into a
richer class of stochastic processes. Especially, with certain scale priors, we
obtain heavy-tailed stochastic processes, and we recover Student&#x27;s $t$
processes in the case of inverse gamma priors. We further analyze the
distributions of the neural networks initialized with our prior setting and
trained with gradient descents and obtain similar results as for
$\mathrm{NNGP}$. We present a practical posterior-inference algorithm for the
scale mixture of $\mathrm{NNGP}$ and empirically demonstrate its usefulness on
regression and classification tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment analysis in conversations has gained increasing attention in recent
years for the growing amount of applications it can serve, e.g., sentiment
analysis, recommender systems, and human-robot interaction. The main difference
between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment
analysis is the existence of context information which may influence the
sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual
information in dialogues, however, remains a challenge. Existing approaches
employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in
a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper, we
propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named
bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis.
In our system, a generalized neural tensor block followed by a two-channel
classifier is designed to perform context compositionality and sentiment
classification, respectively. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state of the art in most cases.</span>

                                        <span>In reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to obtain an optimal policy, for
which the optimality criterion is fundamentally important. Two major optimality
criteria are average and discounted rewards, where the later is typically
considered as an approximation to the former. While the discounted reward is
more popular, it is problematic to apply in environments that have no natural
notion of discounting. This motivates us to revisit a) the progression of
optimality criteria in dynamic programming, b) justification for and
complication of an artificial discount factor, and c) benefits of directly
maximizing the average reward. Our contributions include a thorough examination
of the relationship between average and discounted rewards, as well as a
discussion of their pros and cons in RL. We emphasize that average-reward RL
methods possess the ingredient and mechanism for developing the general
discounting-free optimality criterion (Veinott, 1969) in RL.</span>

                                        <span>In problem-solving, we humans can come up with multiple novel solutions to
the same problem. However, reinforcement learning algorithms can only produce a
set of monotonous policies that maximize the cumulative reward but lack
diversity and novelty. In this work, we address the problem of generating novel
policies in reinforcement learning tasks. Instead of following the
multi-objective framework used in existing methods, we propose to rethink the
problem under a novel perspective of constrained optimization. We first
introduce a new metric to evaluate the difference between policies and then
design two practical novel policy generation methods following the new
perspective. The two proposed methods, namely the Constrained Task Novel
Bisector (CTNB) and the Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD), are derived from
the feasible direction method and the interior point method commonly known in
the constrained optimization literature. Experimental comparisons on the MuJoCo
control suite show our methods can achieve substantial improvement over
previous novelty-seeking methods in terms of both the novelty of policies and
their performances in the primal task.</span>

                                        <span>Feedforward neural networks are widely used as universal predictive models to
fit data distribution. Common gradient-based learning, however, suffers from
many drawbacks making the training process ineffective and time-consuming.
Alternative randomized learning does not use gradients but selects hidden node
parameters randomly. This makes the training process extremely fast. However,
the problem in randomized learning is how to determine the random parameters. A
recently proposed method uses autoencoders for unsupervised parameter learning.
This method showed superior performance on classification tasks. In this work,
we apply this method to regression problems, and, finding that it has some
drawbacks, we show how to improve it. We propose a learning method of
autoencoders that controls the produced random weights. We also propose how to
determine the biases of hidden nodes. We empirically compare autoencoder based
learning with other randomized learning methods proposed recently for
regression and find that despite the proposed improvement of the autoencoder
based learning, it does not outperform its competitors in fitting accuracy.
Moreover, the method is much more complex than its competitors.</span>

depend on alternative definitions of gaps. These definitions are based on the
insight that, in order to achieve a favorable regret, an algorithm does not
need to learn how to behave optimally in states that are not reached by an
optimal policy. We prove tighter upper regret bounds for optimistic algorithms
and accompany them with new information-theoretic lower bounds for a large

                                        <span>Academia and industry have developed several platforms to support the popular
privacy-preserving distributed learning method -- Federated Learning (FL).
However, these platforms are complex to use and require a deep understanding of
FL, which imposes high barriers to entry for beginners, limits the productivity
of researchers, and compromises deployment efficiency. In this paper, we
propose the first low-code FL platform, EasyFL, to enable users with various
levels of expertise to experiment and prototype FL applications with little
coding. We achieve this goal while ensuring great flexibility and extensibility
for customization by unifying simple API design, modular design, and granular
training flow abstraction. With only a few lines of code, EasyFL empowers them
with many out-of-the-box functionalities to accelerate experimentation and
deployment. These practical functionalities are heterogeneity simulation,
comprehensive tracking, distributed training optimization, and seamless
deployment. They are proposed based on challenges identified in the proposed FL
life cycle. Compared with other platforms, EasyFL not only requires just three
lines of code (at least 10x lesser) to build a vanilla FL application but also
incurs lower training overhead. Besides, our evaluations demonstrate that
EasyFL expedites distributed training by 1.5x. It also improves the efficiency
of deployment. We believe that EasyFL will increase the productivity of
researchers and democratize FL to wider audiences.</span>

                                        <span>Relational databases are the de facto standard for storing and querying
structured data, and extracting insights from structured data requires advanced
analytics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction
performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may
not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is
that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute
values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be
easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is
combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore,
the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also
highlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes
applications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.

In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network
tailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on
ARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature
interactions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first
transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining
the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross
feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate
the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model
cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively.
Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used
for each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our
extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net
consistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable
predictions for data-driven decision making.</span>

regression problems, inspired by the probabilistic $k$-nearest neighbors
algorithm. Using a conditionally specified model, predictions for out-of-sample
inputs are based on similarities to each observed data point, yielding
predictive distributions represented by Gaussian mixtures. Posterior inference
is performed on the parameters of the mixture components as well as the
distance metric using a mean-field variational Bayes algorithm accompanied with
a stochastic gradient-based optimization procedure. The proposed method is
especially advantageous in settings where inputs are of relatively high
dimension in comparison to the data size, where input--output relationships are
complex, and where predictive distributions may be skewed or multimodal.
Computational studies on two synthetic datasets and one dataset comprising dose
statistics of radiation therapy treatment plans show that our
mixture-of-experts method performs similarly or better than a conditional
Dirichlet process mixture model both in terms of validation metrics and visual
inspection.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective technique to co-training
machine learning models without actually sharing data and leaking privacy.
However, most existing FL methods focus on the supervised setting and ignore
the utilization of unlabeled data. Although there are a few existing studies
trying to incorporate unlabeled data into FL, they all fail to maintain
performance guarantees or generalization ability in various real-world
settings. In this paper, we focus on designing a general framework FedSiam to
tackle different scenarios of federated semi-supervised learning, including
four settings in the labels-at-client scenario and two setting in the
labels-at-server scenario. FedSiam is built upon a siamese network into FL with
a momentum update to handle the non-IID challenges introduced by unlabeled
data. We further propose a new metric to measure the divergence of local model
layers within the siamese network. Based on the divergence, FedSiam can
automatically select layer-level parameters to be uploaded to the server in an
adaptive manner. Experimental results on three datasets under two scenarios
with different data distribution settings demonstrate that the proposed FedSiam
framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes an invariant causal predictor that is robust to
distribution shift across domains and maximally reserves the transferable
invariant information. Based on a disentangled causal factorization, we
formulate the distribution shift as soft interventions in the system, which
covers a wide range of cases for distribution shift as we do not make prior
specifications on the causal structure or the intervened variables. Instead of
imposing regularizations to constrain the invariance of the predictor, we
propose to predict by the intervened conditional expectation based on the
do-operator and then prove that it is invariant across domains. More
importantly, we prove that the proposed predictor is the robust predictor that
minimizes the worst-case quadratic loss among the distributions of all domains.
For empirical learning, we propose an intuitive and flexible estimating method
based on data regeneration and present a local causal discovery procedure to
guide the regeneration step. The key idea is to regenerate data such that the
regenerated distribution is compatible with the intervened graph, which allows
us to incorporate standard supervised learning methods with the regenerated
data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the
efficacy of our predictor in improving the predictive accuracy and robustness
across domains.</span>

given $M$ base controllers for an unknown Markov decision process, and wishes
to combine them optimally to produce a potentially new controller that can
outperform each of the base ones. This can be useful in tuning across
controllers, learnt possibly in mismatched or simulated environments, to obtain
a good controller for a given target environment with relatively few trials.

\par We propose a gradient-based approach that operates over a class of

that we can employ rollouts and simultaneous perturbation stochastic

estimate of the squared gradient to compute adaptive step sizes, achieving
better convergence than SGD in face of noisy objectives. However, Adam can have
undesirable convergence behaviors due to unstable or extreme adaptive learning
rates. Methods such as AMSGrad and AdaBound have been proposed to stabilize the
adaptive learning rates of Adam in the later stage of training, but they do not
outperform Adam in some practical tasks such as training Transformers
\cite{transformer}. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate
principle, in which the running mean of squared gradient in Adam is replaced by
a weighted mean, with weights chosen to maximize the estimated variance of each
coordinate. This results in a faster adaptation to the local gradient variance,
which leads to more desirable empirical convergence behaviors than Adam. We
prove the proposed algorithm converges under mild assumptions for nonconvex
stochastic optimization problems, and demonstrate the improved efficacy of our
adaptive averaging approach on machine translation, natural language
understanding and large-batch pretraining of BERT. The code is available at

model learning methods to controls is an exciting prospect. However, there is a
strong reluctance to use these methods on safety-critical systems, which have
constraints on safety, stability, and real-time performance. We propose a
framework which satisfies these constraints while allowing the use of deep
neural networks for learning model uncertainties. Central to our method is the
use of Bayesian model learning, which provides an avenue for maintaining
appropriate degrees of caution in the face of the unknown. In the proposed
approach, we develop an adaptive control framework leveraging the theory of
stochastic CLFs (Control Lyapunov Functions) and stochastic CBFs (Control
Barrier Functions) along with tractable Bayesian model learning via Gaussian
Processes or Bayesian neural networks. Under reasonable assumptions, we
guarantee stability and safety while adapting to unknown dynamics with
probability 1. We demonstrate this architecture for high-speed terrestrial
mobility targeting potential applications in safety-critical high-speed Mars
rover missions.</span>

                                        <span>Most graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) perform poorly in graphs
where neighbors typically have different features/classes (heterophily) and
when stacking multiple layers (oversmoothing). These two seemingly unrelated
problems have been studied independently, but there is recent empirical
evidence that solving one problem may benefit the other. In this work, going
beyond empirical observations, we aim to: (1) propose a new perspective to
analyze the heterophily and oversmoothing problems under a unified theoretical
framework, (2) identify the common causes of the two problems based on the
proposed framework, and (3) propose simple yet effective strategies that
address the common causes. Focusing on the node classification task, we use
linear separability of node representations as an indicator to reflect the
performance of GCNs and we propose to study the linear separability by
analyzing the statistical change of the node representations in the graph
convolution. We find that the relative degree of a node (compared to its
neighbors) and the heterophily level of a node&#x27;s neighborhood are the root
causes that influence the separability of node representations. Our analysis
suggests that: (1) Nodes with high heterophily always produce less separable
representations after graph convolution; (2) Even with low heterophily, degree
disparity between nodes can influence the network dynamics and result in a
pseudo-heterophily situation, which helps to explain oversmoothing. Based on
our insights, we propose simple modifications to the GCN architecture -- i.e.,
degree corrections and signed messages -- which alleviate the root causes of
these issues, and also show this empirically on 9 real networks. Compared to
other approaches, which tend to work well in one regime but fail in others, our
modified GCN model consistently performs well across all settings.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a low-latency real-time (LLRT) non-parallel voice
conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core
of $2.1$--$2.7$ GHz CPU on a real-time factor of $0.87$--$0.95$, including
input/output, feature extraction, on a frame shift of $10$ ms, a window length
of $27.5$ ms, and $2$ lookup frames.</span>

                                        <span>Normalizing flows are an essential alternative to GANs for generative
modelling, which can be optimized directly on the maximum likelihood of the
dataset. They also allow computation of the exact latent vector corresponding
to an image since they are composed of invertible transformations. However, the
requirement of invertibility of the transformation prevents standard and
expressive neural network models such as CNNs from being directly used.
Emergent convolutions were proposed to construct an invertible 3$\times$3 CNN
layer using a pair of masked CNN layers, making them inefficient. We study
conditions such that 3$\times$3 CNNs are invertible, allowing them to construct
expressive normalizing flows. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on
a padded CNN for it to be invertible. Our conditions for invertibility are
simple, can easily be maintained during the training process. Since we require
only a single CNN layer for every effective invertible CNN layer, our approach
is more efficient than emerging convolutions. We also proposed a coupling
method, Quad-coupling. We benchmark our approach and show similar performance
results to emergent convolutions while improving the model&#x27;s efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the fact that deep reinforcement learning (RL) has surpassed
human-level performances in various tasks, it still has several fundamental
challenges. First, most RL methods require intensive data from the exploration
of the environment to achieve satisfactory performance. Second, the use of
neural networks in RL renders it hard to interpret the internals of the system
in a way that humans can understand. To address these two challenges, we
propose a framework that enables an RL agent to reason over its exploration
process and distill high-level knowledge for effectively guiding its future
explorations. Specifically, we propose a novel RL algorithm that learns
high-level knowledge in the form of a finite reward automaton by using the L*
learning algorithm. We prove that in episodic RL, a finite reward automaton can
express any non-Markovian bounded reward functions with finitely many reward
values and approximate any non-Markovian bounded reward function (with
infinitely many reward values) with arbitrary precision. We also provide a
lower bound for the episode length such that the proposed RL approach almost
surely converges to an optimal policy in the limit. We test this approach on
two RL environments with non-Markovian reward functions, choosing a variety of
tasks with increasing complexity for each environment. We compare our algorithm
with the state-of-the-art RL algorithms for non-Markovian reward functions,
such as Joint Inference of Reward machines and Policies for RL (JIRP), Learning
Reward Machine (LRM), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2). Our results show
that our algorithm converges to an optimal policy faster than other baseline
methods.</span>

reduce their heavy computation and memory requirements. A saliency metric
estimates which parameters can be safely pruned with little impact on the
classification performance of the DNN. Many saliency metrics have been
proposed, each within the context of a wider pruning algorithm. The result is
that it is difficult to separate the effectiveness of the saliency metric from
the wider pruning algorithm that surrounds it. Similar-looking saliency metrics
can yield very different results because of apparently minor design choices. We
propose a taxonomy of saliency metrics based on four mostly-orthogonal
principal components. We show that a broad range of metrics from the pruning
literature can be grouped according to these components. Our taxonomy not only
serves as a guide to prior work, but allows us to construct new saliency
metrics by exploring novel combinations of our taxonomic components. We perform
an in-depth experimental investigation of more than 300 saliency metrics. Our
results provide decisive answers to open research questions, and demonstrate
the importance of reduction and scaling when pruning groups of weights. We find
that some of our constructed metrics can outperform the best existing
state-of-the-art metrics for convolutional neural network channel pruning.</span>

evaluate a target policy. Previous OPE methods mainly focus on precisely
estimating the true performance of a policy. We observe that in many
applications, (1) the end goal of OPE is to compare two or multiple candidate
policies and choose a good one, which is actually a much simpler task than
evaluating their true performance; and (2) there are usually multiple policies
that have been deployed in real-world systems and thus whose true performance
is known through serving real users. Inspired by the two observations, in this
work, we define a new problem, supervised off-policy ranking (SOPR), which aims
to rank a set of new/target policies based on supervised learning by leveraging
off-policy data and policies with known performance. We further propose a
method for supervised off-policy ranking that learns a policy scoring model by
correctly ranking training policies with known performance rather than
estimating their precise performance. Our method leverages logged states and
policies to learn a Transformer based model that maps offline interaction data
including logged states and the actions taken by a target policy on these
states to a score. Experiments on different games, datasets, training policy
sets, and test policy sets show that our method outperforms strong baseline OPE
methods in terms of both rank correlation and performance gap between the truly
best and the best of the ranked top three policies. Furthermore, our method is
more stable than baseline methods.</span>

are scarce, there are abundant auxiliary datasets that potentially contain
useful information. We propose the problem of extended few-shot learning to
study these scenarios. We then introduce a framework to address the challenges
of efficiently selecting and effectively using auxiliary data in few-shot image
classification. Given a large auxiliary dataset and a notion of semantic
similarity among classes, we automatically select pseudo shots, which are
labeled examples from other classes related to the target task. We show that
naive approaches, such as (1) modeling these additional examples the same as
the target task examples or (2) using them to learn features via transfer
learning, only increase accuracy by a modest amount. Instead, we propose a
masking module that adjusts the features of auxiliary data to be more similar
to those of the target classes. We show that this masking module performs
better than naively modeling the support examples and transfer learning by 4.68

increasingly demanding yet challenging for modern E-commerce recommender
systems. When performing clothes matching, most existing approaches leverage
the latent visual features extracted from fashion item images for compatibility
modelling, which lacks explainability of generated matching results and can
hardly convince users of the recommendations. Though recent methods start to
incorporate pre-defined attribute information (e.g., colour, style, length,
etc.) for learning item representations and improving the model
interpretability, their utilisation of attribute information is still mainly
reserved for enhancing the learned item representations and generating
explanations via post-processing. As a result, this creates a severe bottleneck
when we are trying to advance the recommendation accuracy and generating
fine-grained explanations since the explicit attributes have only loose
connections to the actual recommendation process. This work aims to tackle the
explainability challenge in fashion recommendation tasks by proposing a novel
Attribute-aware Fashion Recommender (AFRec). Specifically, AFRec recommender
assesses the outfit compatibility by explicitly leveraging the extracted
attribute-level representations from each item&#x27;s visual feature. The attributes
serve as the bridge between two fashion items, where we quantify the affinity
of a pair of items through the learned compatibility between their attributes.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that, by making full use of the
explicit attributes in the recommendation process, AFRec is able to achieve
state-of-the-art recommendation accuracy and generate intuitive explanations at
the same time.</span>

functions, is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. Deep Sets is a
popular method which is known to be a universal approximator for continuous set
functions. We provide a theoretical analysis of Deep Sets which shows that this
universal approximation property is only guaranteed if the model&#x27;s latent space
is sufficiently high-dimensional. If the latent space is even one dimension
lower than necessary, there exist piecewise-affine functions for which Deep
Sets performs no better than a na\&quot;ive constant baseline, as judged by
worst-case error. Deep Sets may be viewed as the most efficient incarnation of
the Janossy pooling paradigm. We identify this paradigm as encompassing most
currently popular set-learning methods. Based on this connection, we discuss
the implications of our results for set learning more broadly, and identify
some open questions on the universality of Janossy pooling in general.</span>

                                        <span>Reliable deployment of machine learning models such as neural networks
continues to be challenging due to several limitations. Some of the main
shortcomings are the lack of interpretability and the lack of robustness
against adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper, we
explore the possibilities and limits of adversarial attacks for explainable
machine learning models. First, we extend the notion of adversarial examples to
fit in explainable machine learning scenarios, in which the inputs, the output
classifications and the explanations of the model&#x27;s decisions are assessed by
humans. Next, we propose a comprehensive framework to study whether (and how)
adversarial examples can be generated for explainable models under human
assessment, introducing novel attack paradigms. In particular, our framework
considers a wide range of relevant (yet often ignored) factors such as the type
of problem, the user expertise or the objective of the explanations in order to
identify the attack strategies that should be adopted in each scenario to
successfully deceive the model (and the human). These contributions intend to
serve as a basis for a more rigorous and realistic study of adversarial
examples in the field of explainable machine learning.</span>

non-convex distributed learning over heterogeneous datasets. MARINA employs a
novel communication compression strategy based on the compression of gradient
differences that is reminiscent of but different from the strategy employed in
the DIANA method of Mishchenko et al. (2019). Unlike virtually all competing
distributed first-order methods, including DIANA, ours is based on a carefully
designed biased gradient estimator, which is the key to its superior
theoretical and practical performance. The communication complexity bounds we
prove for MARINA are evidently better than those of all previous first-order
methods. Further, we develop and analyze two variants of MARINA: VR-MARINA and
PP-MARINA. The first method is designed for the case when the local loss
functions owned by clients are either of a finite sum or of an expectation
form, and the second method allows for a partial participation of clients -- a
feature important in federated learning. All our methods are superior to
previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of oracle/communication complexity.
Finally, we provide a convergence analysis of all methods for problems
satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.</span>

only 3 minutes of target audio-video data, without requiring {\em any} training

training into convex spaces. Given the set of solutions of our convex
optimization program, we show how to construct exactly the entire set of
optimal neural networks. We provide a detailed characterization of this optimal

perspective, (i) we establish that Clarke stationary points found by stochastic
gradient descent correspond to the global optimum of a subsampled convex
problem (ii) we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for checking if a neural
network is a global minimum of the training loss (iii) we provide an explicit
construction of a continuous path between any neural network and the global
minimum of its sublevel set and (iv) characterize the minimal size of the

state is an important task permeating multiple fields including control theory,
biology, and materials science. In causal models, such transformations can be
achieved by performing a set of interventions. In this paper, we consider the
problem of identifying a shift intervention that matches the desired mean of a
system through active learning. We define the Markov equivalence class that is
identifiable from shift interventions and propose two active learning
strategies that are guaranteed to exactly match a desired mean. We then derive
a worst-case lower bound for the number of interventions required and show that
these strategies are optimal for certain classes of graphs. In particular, we
show that our strategies may require exponentially fewer interventions than the
previously considered approaches, which optimize for structure learning in the
underlying causal graph. In line with our theoretical results, we also
demonstrate experimentally that our proposed active learning strategies require
fewer interventions compared to several baselines.</span>

these approaches remain, for the most part, deterringly sensitive to
hyper-parameters and are often riddled with essential engineering feats
allowing their success. We consider the case of off-policy generative
adversarial imitation learning, and perform an in-depth review, qualitative and
quantitative, of the method. We show that forcing the learned reward function
to be local Lipschitz-continuous is a sine qua non condition for the method to
perform well. We then study the effects of this necessary condition and provide
several theoretical results involving the local Lipschitzness of the
state-value function. We complement these guarantees with empirical evidence
attesting to the strong positive effect that the consistent satisfaction of the
Lipschitzness constraint on the reward has on imitation performance. Finally,
we tackle a generic pessimistic reward preconditioning add-on spawning a large
class of reward shaping methods, which makes the base method it is plugged into
provably more robust, as shown in several additional theoretical guarantees. We
then discuss these through a fine-grained lens and share our insights.
Crucially, the guarantees derived and reported in this work are valid for any
reward satisfying the Lipschitzness condition, nothing is specific to
imitation. As such, these may be of independent interest.</span>

understandings to explain why randomly initialized neural network trained by
first-order optimization methods is able to achieve zero training loss, even
though its landscape is non-convex and non-smooth. Recently, there are some
works to demystifies this phenomenon under over-parameterized regime. In this
work, we make further progress on this area by considering a commonly used
momentum optimization algorithm: Nesterov accelerated method (NAG). We analyze
the convergence of NAG for two-layer fully connected neural network with ReLU
activation. Specifically, we prove that the error of NAG converges to zero at a
linear convergence rate $1-\Theta(1/\sqrt{\kappa})$, where $\kappa &gt; 1$ is
determined by the initialization and the architecture of neural network.
Comparing to the rate $1-\Theta(1/\kappa)$ of gradient descent, NAG achieves an
acceleration. Besides, it also validates NAG and Heavy-ball method can achieve

                                        <span>Current computational-emotion research has focused on applying acoustic
properties to analyze how emotions are perceived mathematically or used in
natural language processing machine learning models. While recent interest has
focused on analyzing emotions from the spoken voice, little experimentation has
been performed to discover how emotions are recognized in the singing voice --
both in noiseless and noisy data (i.e., data that is either inaccurate,
difficult to interpret, has corrupted/distorted/nonsense information like
actual noise sounds in this case, or has a low ratio of usable/unusable
information). Not only does this ignore the challenges of training machine
learning models on more subjective data and testing them with much noisier
data, but there is also a clear disconnect in progress between advancing the
development of convolutional neural networks and the goal of emotionally
cognizant artificial intelligence. By training a new model to include this type
of information with a rich comprehension of psycho-acoustic properties, not
only can models be trained to recognize information within extremely noisy
data, but advancement can be made toward more complex biofeedback applications
-- including creating a model which could recognize emotions given any human
information (language, breath, voice, body, posture) and be used in any
performance medium (music, speech, acting) or psychological assistance for
patients with disorders such as BPD, alexithymia, autism, among others. This
paper seeks to reflect and expand upon the findings of related research and
present a stepping-stone toward this end goal.</span>

                                        <span>Time Series data are broadly studied in various domains of transportation
systems. Traffic data area challenging example of spatio-temporal data, as it
is multi-variate time series with high correlations in spatial and temporal
neighborhoods. Spatio-temporal clustering of traffic flow data find similar
patterns in both spatial and temporal domain, where it provides better
capability for analyzing a transportation network, and improving related
machine learning models, such as traffic flow prediction and anomaly detection.
In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal clustering model, where it clusters
time series data based on spatial and temporal contexts. We propose a variation
of a Deep Embedded Clustering(DEC) model for finding spatio-temporal clusters.
The proposed model Spatial-DEC (S-DEC) use prior geographical information in
building latent feature representations. We also define evaluation metrics for
spatio-temporal clusters. Not only do the obtained clusters have better
temporal similarity when evaluated using DTW distance, but also the clusters
better represents spatial connectivity and dis-connectivity. We use traffic
flow data obtained by PeMS in our analysis. The results show that the proposed
Spatial-DEC can find more desired spatio-temporal clusters.</span>

                                        <span>Differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for privacy-preserving
data analysis. This paper proposes the first differentially private procedure
for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing.
Inspired by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BHq), our approach is to first
repeatedly add noise to the logarithms of the $p$-values to ensure differential
privacy and to select an approximately smallest $p$-value serving as a
promising candidate at each iteration; the selected $p$-values are further
supplied to the BHq and our private procedure releases only the rejected ones.
Moreover, we develop a new technique that is based on a backward submartingale
for proving FDR control of a broad class of multiple testing procedures,
including our private procedure, and both the BHq step-up and step-down
procedures. As a novel aspect, the proof works for arbitrary dependence between
the true null and false null test statistics, while FDR control is maintained
up to a small multiplicative factor.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a framework for Bayesian inference that can
offer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For
example, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP
model enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP
scales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all
examples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been
proposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples.
Importantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables
control over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse
GPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate
inference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is
variational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as
an optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log
marginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework,
where pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the
approximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters
of the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can
naturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from
regression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification
problems with discrete labels, but also multilabel problems. The purpose of
this tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for readers without
prior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the subject enables
also access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted VI as well as
interdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an inspiration for new
research ideas.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate modeling of boundary conditions is crucial in computational physics.
The ever increasing use of neural networks as surrogates for physics-related
problems calls for an improved understanding of boundary condition treatment,
and its influence on the network accuracy. In this paper, several strategies to
impose boundary conditions (namely padding, improved spatial context, and
explicit encoding of physical boundaries) are investigated in the context of
fully convolutional networks applied to recurrent tasks. These strategies are
evaluated on two spatio-temporal evolving problems modeled by partial
differential equations: the 2D propagation of acoustic waves (hyperbolic PDE)
and the heat equation (parabolic PDE). Results reveal a high sensitivity of
both accuracy and stability on the boundary implementation in such recurrent
tasks. It is then demonstrated that the choice of the optimal padding strategy
is directly linked to the data semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of
additional input spatial context or explicit physics-based rules allows a
better handling of boundaries in particular for large number of recurrences,
resulting in more robust and stable neural networks, while facilitating the
design and versatility of such networks.</span>

learning models against adversarial perturbations, so far, it still remains
rather unclear what the principles are behind the existence of adversarial
perturbations, and what adversarial training does to the neural network to
remove them.

In this paper, we present a principle that we call Feature Purification,
where we show one of the causes of the existence of adversarial examples is the
accumulation of certain small dense mixtures in the hidden weights during the
training process of a neural network; and more importantly, one of the goals of
adversarial training is to remove such mixtures to purify hidden weights. We
present both experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to illustrate this principle,
and a theoretical result proving that for certain natural classification tasks,
training a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation using randomly
initialized gradient descent indeed satisfies this principle.

Technically, we give, to the best of our knowledge, the first result proving
that the following two can hold simultaneously for training a neural network
with ReLU activation. (1) Training over the original data is indeed non-robust
to small adversarial perturbations of some radius. (2) Adversarial training,
even with an empirical perturbation algorithm such as FGM, can in fact be
provably robust against ANY perturbations of the same radius. Finally, we also
prove a complexity lower bound, showing that low complexity models such as
linear classifiers, low-degree polynomials, or even the neural tangent kernel
for this network, CANNOT defend against perturbations of this same radius, no
matter what algorithms are used to train them.</span>

state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,
classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternative
optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or
convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding
with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the
development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex
approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an
atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works
seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially
reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is
degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an
efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed
scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage
optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary
recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom
calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme
can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of
samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application
on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.</span>

privacy has become of paramount importance, particularly in the healthcare
domain. In this work, we aim to utilise patient data extracted from multiple
hospital data centres to train a machine learning model without sacrificing
patient privacy. We develop a scheduling algorithm in conjunction with a
student-teacher algorithm that is deployed in a federated manner. This allows a
central model to learn from batches of data at each federal node. The teacher
acts between data centres to update the main task (student) algorithm using the
data that is stored in the various data centres. We show that the scheduler,
trained using meta-gradients, can effectively organise training and as a result
train a machine learning model on a diverse dataset without needing explicit
access to the patient data. We achieve state-of-the-art performance and show
how our method overcomes some of the problems faced in the federated learning
such as node poisoning. We further show how the scheduler can be used as a
mechanism for transfer learning, allowing different teachers to work together
in training a student for state-of-the-art performance.</span>

resulting in a plethora of regression models and performance measures. However,
there are few techniques specially dedicated to solve the problem of how to
incorporate categorical features to regression problems. Usually, categorical
feature encoders are general enough to cover both classification and regression
problems. This lack of specificity results in underperforming regression
models. In this paper,we provide an in-depth analysis of how to tackle high
cardinality categor-ical features with the quantile. Our proposal outperforms
state-of-the-encoders, including the traditional statistical mean target
encoder, when considering the Mean Absolute Error, especially in the presence
of long-tailed or skewed distributions. Besides, to deal with possible
overfitting when there are categories with small support, our encoder benefits
from additive smoothing. Finally, we describe how to expand the encoded values
by creating a set of features with different quantiles. This expanded encoder
provides a more informative output about the categorical feature in question,
further boosting the performance of the regression model.</span>

towards better understanding them. In this work, we motivate sparse subspace
clustering (SSC) with an aim to learn affinity graphs from the latent structure
of a given neural network layer trained over a set of inputs. We then use tools
from Community Detection to quantify structures present in the input. These
experiments reveal that as we go deeper in a network, inputs tend to have an
increasing affinity to other inputs of the same class. Subsequently, we utilise
matrix similarity measures to perform layer-wise comparisons between affinity
graphs. In doing so we first demonstrate that when comparing a given layer
currently under training to its final state, the shallower the layer of the
network, the quicker it is to converge than the deeper layers. When performing
a pairwise analysis of the entire network architecture, we observe that, as the
network increases in size, it reorganises from a state where each layer is
moderately similar to its neighbours, to a state where layers within a block
have high similarity than to layers in other blocks. Finally, we analyze the
learned affinity graphs of the final convolutional layer of the network and
demonstrate how an input&#x27;s local neighbourhood affects its classification by
the network.</span>

                                        <span>Strategies for improving the training and prediction quality of weakly
supervised machine learning models vary in how much they are tailored to a
specific task or integrated with a specific model architecture. In this work,
we introduce Knodle, a software framework that treats weak data annotations,
deep learning models, and methods for improving weakly supervised training as
separate, modular components. This modularization gives the training process
access to fine-grained information such as data set characteristics, matches of
heuristic rules, or elements of the deep learning model ultimately used for
prediction. Hence, our framework can encompass a wide range of training methods
for improving weak supervision, ranging from methods that only look at
correlations of rules and output classes (independently of the machine learning
model trained with the resulting labels), to those that harness the interplay
of neural networks and weakly labeled data. We illustrate the benchmarking
potential of the framework with a performance comparison of several reference
implementations on a selection of datasets that are already available in
Knodle.

The framework is published as an open-source Python package knodle and

selecting the most useful data samples from which it learns. Single-criterion
based methods (i.e., informativeness and representativeness based methods) are
simple and efficient; however, they lack adaptability to different real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a multiple-criteria based active
learning algorithm, which incorporates three complementary criteria, i.e.,
informativeness, representativeness and diversity, to make appropriate
selections in the active learning rounds under different data types. We
consider the selection process as a Determinantal Point Process, which good
balance among these criteria. We refine the query selection strategy by both
selecting the hardest unlabeled data sample and biasing towards the classifiers
that are more suitable for the current data distribution. In addition, we also
consider the dependencies and relationships between these data points in data
selection by means of centroidbased clustering approaches. Through evaluations
on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our method performs
significantly better and is more stable than other multiple-criteria based AL
algorithms.</span>

a framework for sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning that take advantage of

more than 100.000 cells in 10 or more features. AI systems are able to diagnose
such data with almost the same accuracy as human experts. However, there is one
central challenge in such systems: their decisions have far-reaching
consequences for the health and life of people, and therefore, the decisions of
AI systems need to be understandable and justifiable by humans. In this work,
we present a novel explainable AI method, called ALPODS, which is able to
classify (diagnose) cases based on clusters, i.e., subpopulations, in the
high-dimensional data. ALPODS is able to explain its decisions in a form that
is understandable for human experts. For the identified subpopulations, fuzzy
reasoning rules expressed in the typical language of domain experts are
generated. A visualization method based on these rules allows human experts to
understand the reasoning used by the AI system. A comparison to a selection of

                                        <span>A prominent technique for reducing the memory footprint of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) without decreasing the accuracy significantly is quantization.
However, the state-of-the-art only focus on employing the weight quantization
directly from a specific quantization scheme, i.e., either the post-training
quantization (PTQ) or the in-training quantization (ITQ), and do not consider
(1) quantizing other SNN parameters (e.g., neuron membrane potential), (2)
exploring different combinations of quantization approaches (i.e., quantization
schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes), and (3) selecting the SNN
model with a good memory-accuracy trade-off at the end. Therefore, the memory
saving offered by these state-of-the-art to meet the targeted accuracy is
limited, thereby hindering processing SNNs on the resource-constrained systems
(e.g., the IoT-Edge devices). Towards this, we propose Q-SpiNN, a novel
quantization framework for memory-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of the
Q-SpiNN are: (1) employing quantization for different SNN parameters based on
their significance to the accuracy, (2) exploring different combinations of
quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes to find efficient
SNN model candidates, and (3) developing an algorithm that quantifies the
benefit of the memory-accuracy trade-off obtained by the candidates, and
selects the Pareto-optimal one. The experimental results show that, for the
unsupervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory footprint by ca. 4x, while
maintaining the accuracy within 1% from the baseline on the MNIST dataset. For
the supervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory by ca. 2x, while keeping
the accuracy within 2% from the baseline on the DVS-Gesture dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Fine-tuning is a common practice in deep learning, achieving excellent
generalization results on downstream tasks using relatively little training
data. Although widely used in practice, it is lacking strong theoretical
understanding. We analyze the sample complexity of this scheme for regression
with linear teachers in several architectures. Intuitively, the success of
fine-tuning depends on the similarity between the source tasks and the target
task, however measuring it is non trivial. We show that a relevant measure
considers the relation between the source task, the target task and the
covariance structure of the target data. In the setting of linear regression,
we show that under realistic settings a substantial sample complexity reduction
is plausible when the above measure is low. For deep linear regression, we
present a novel result regarding the inductive bias of gradient-based training
when the network is initialized with pretrained weights. Using this result we
show that the similarity measure for this setting is also affected by the depth
of the network. We further present results on shallow ReLU models, and analyze
the dependence of sample complexity there on source and target tasks. We
empirically demonstrate our results for both synthetic and realistic data.</span>

                                        <span>We formally study how ensemble of deep learning models can improve test
accuracy, and how the superior performance of ensemble can be distilled into a
single model using knowledge distillation. We consider the challenging case
where the ensemble is simply an average of the outputs of a few independently
trained neural networks with the SAME architecture, trained using the SAME
algorithm on the SAME data set, and they only differ by the random seeds used
in the initialization.

We empirically show that ensemble/knowledge distillation in deep learning
works very differently from traditional learning theory, especially differently
from ensemble of random feature mappings or the neural-tangent-kernel feature
mappings, and is potentially out of the scope of existing theorems. Thus, to
properly understand ensemble and knowledge distillation in deep learning, we
develop a theory showing that when data has a structure we refer to as
&quot;multi-view&quot;, then ensemble of independently trained neural networks can
provably improve test accuracy, and such superior test accuracy can also be
provably distilled into a single model by training a single model to match the
output of the ensemble instead of the true label. Our result sheds light on how
ensemble works in deep learning in a way that is completely different from
traditional theorems, and how the &quot;dark knowledge&quot; is hidden in the outputs of
the ensemble -- that can be used in knowledge distillation -- comparing to the
true data labels. In the end, we prove that self-distillation can also be
viewed as implicitly combining ensemble and knowledge distillation to improve
test accuracy.</span>

central topic of research, with huge practical impacts. Among the numerous ways
to address privacy-preserving learning, we here take the perspective of
computing the divergences between distributions under the Differential Privacy
(DP) framework -- being able to compute divergences between distributions is
pivotal for many machine learning problems, such as learning generative models
or domain adaptation problems. Instead of resorting to the popular
gradient-based sanitization method for DP, we tackle the problem at its roots
by focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly making it
differentially private. Our main contribution is as follows: we analyze the
property of adding a Gaussian perturbation to the intrinsic randomized
mechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance, and we establish the
sensitivityof the resulting differentially private mechanism. One of our
important findings is that this DP mechanism transforms the Sliced Wasserstein
distance into another distance, that we call the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein
Distance. This new differentially private distribution distance can be plugged
into generative models and domain adaptation algorithms in a transparent way,
and we empirically show that it yields highly competitive performance compared
with gradient-based DP approaches from the literature, with almost no loss in
accuracy for the domain adaptation problems that we consider.</span>

tasks in many fields. However, the estimates obtained are not fully understood
on function space. Empirical results suggest that typical training algorithms
favor regularized solutions. These observations motivate us to analyze
properties of the neural networks found by gradient descent initialized close
to zero, that is frequently employed to perform the training task. As a
starting point, we consider one dimensional (shallow) ReLU neural networks in
which weights are chosen randomly and only the terminal layer is trained.
First, we rigorously show that for such networks ridge regularized regression
corresponds in function space to regularizing the estimate&#x27;s second derivative
for fairly general loss functionals. For least squares regression, we show that
the trained network converges to the smooth spline interpolation of the
training data as the number of hidden nodes tends to infinity. Moreover, we
derive a correspondence between the early stopped gradient descent and the
smoothing spline regression. Our analysis might give valuable insight on the
properties of the solutions obtained using gradient descent methods in general

in the black-box setting. Though several methods have demonstrated impressive
transferability of untargeted adversarial examples, targeted adversarial
transferability is still challenging. The existing methods either have low
targeted transferability or sacrifice computational efficiency. In this paper,
we develop a simple yet practical framework to efficiently craft targeted
transfer-based adversarial examples. Specifically, we propose a conditional
generative attacking model, which can generate the adversarial examples
targeted at different classes by simply altering the class embedding and share
a single backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves
the success rates of targeted black-box attacks by a significant margin over
the existing methods -- it reaches an average success rate of 29.6\% against
six diverse models based only on one substitute white-box model in the standard
testing of NeurIPS 2017 competition, which outperforms the state-of-the-art
gradient-based attack methods (with an average success rate of $&lt;$2\%) by a
large margin. Moreover, the proposed method is also more efficient beyond an
order of magnitude than gradient-based methods.</span>

fields as varied as college admissions, credit lending, and criminal
sentencing. The socially sensitive nature of some of these applications
together with increasing regulatory constraints has necessitated the need for
algorithms that are both fair and interpretable. In this paper we consider the
problem of building Boolean rule sets in disjunctive normal form (DNF), an
interpretable model for binary classification, subject to fairness constraints.
We formulate the problem as an integer program that maximizes classification
accuracy with explicit constraints on two different measures of classification
parity: equality of opportunity and equalized odds. Column generation
framework, with a novel formulation, is used to efficiently search over
exponentially many possible rules. When combined with faster heuristics, our
method can deal with large data-sets. Compared to other fair and interpretable
classifiers, our method is able to find rule sets that meet stricter notions of
fairness with a modest trade-off in accuracy.</span>

converge faster in deep neural network (DNN) training than stochastic gradient
descent (SGD); however, K-FAC&#x27;s larger memory footprint hinders its
applicability to large models. We present KAISA, a K-FAC-enabled, Adaptable,
Improved, and ScAlable second-order optimizer framework that adapts the memory
footprint, communication, and computation given specific models and hardware to
achieve maximized performance and enhanced scalability. We quantify the
tradeoffs between memory and communication cost and evaluate KAISA on large
models, including ResNet-50, Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and BERT, on up to 128 NVIDIA
A100 GPUs. Compared to the original optimizers, KAISA converges 18.1-36.3%
faster across applications with the same global batch size. Under a fixed
memory budget, KAISA converges 32.5% and 41.6% faster in ResNet-50 and
BERT-Large, respectively. KAISA can balance memory and communication to achieve
scaling efficiency equal to or better than the baseline optimizers.</span>

                                        <span>Continual learning has been a major problem in the deep learning community,
where the main challenge is how to effectively learn a series of newly arriving
tasks without forgetting the knowledge of previous tasks. Initiated by Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), many of the existing works report that knowledge
distillation is effective to preserve the previous knowledge, and hence they
commonly use a soft label for the old task, namely a knowledge distillation
(KD) loss, together with a class label for the new task, namely a cross entropy
(CE) loss, to form a composite loss for a single neural network. However, this
approach suffers from learning the knowledge by a CE loss as a KD loss often
more strongly influences the objective function when they are in a competitive
situation within a single network. This could be a critical problem
particularly in a class incremental scenario, where the knowledge across tasks
as well as within the new task, both of which can only be acquired by a CE
loss, is essentially learned due to the existence of a unified classifier. In
this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method, called
Split-and-Bridge, which can successfully address the above problem by partially
splitting a neural network into two partitions for training the new task
separated from the old task and re-connecting them for learning the knowledge
across tasks. In our thorough experimental analysis, our Split-and-Bridge
method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in KD-based continual
learning.</span>

                                        <span>Modeling complex physical dynamics is a fundamental task in science and
engineering. Traditional physics-based models are interpretable but rely on
rigid assumptions. And the direct numerical approximation is usually
computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and
expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides novel alternatives for efficiently
recognizing complex patterns and emulating nonlinear dynamics, it does not
necessarily obey the governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize
well across different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and
has gained great progress. It aims to take the best from both physics-based
modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientific problems. In
this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of
integrating prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into DL and
discuss the emerging opportunities.</span>

                                        <span>Bias evaluation in machine-learning based services (MLS) based on traditional
algorithmic fairness notions that rely on comparative principles is practically
difficult, making it necessary to rely on human auditor feedback. However, in
spite of taking rigorous training on various comparative fairness notions,
human auditors are known to disagree on various aspects of fairness notions in
practice, making it difficult to collect reliable feedback. This paper offers a
paradigm shift to the domain of algorithmic fairness via proposing a new
fairness notion based on the principle of non-comparative justice. In contrary
to traditional fairness notions where the outcomes of two individuals/groups
are compared, our proposed notion compares the MLS&#x27; outcome with a desired
outcome for each input. This desired outcome naturally describes a human
auditor&#x27;s expectation, and can be easily used to evaluate MLS on crowd-auditing
platforms. We show that any MLS can be deemed fair from the perspective of
comparative fairness (be it in terms of individual fairness, statistical
parity, equal opportunity or calibration) if it is non-comparatively fair with
respect to a fair auditor. We also show that the converse holds true in the
context of individual fairness. Given that such an evaluation relies on the
trustworthiness of the auditor, we also present an approach to identify fair
and reliable auditors by estimating their biases with respect to a given set of
sensitive attributes, as well as quantify the uncertainty in the estimation of
biases within a given MLS. Furthermore, all of the above results are also
validated on COMPAS, German credit and Adult Census Income datasets.</span>

                                        <span>The nearest prototype classification is a less computationally intensive
replacement for the $k$-NN method, especially when large datasets are
considered. In metric spaces, centroids are often used as prototypes to
represent whole clusters. The selection of cluster prototypes in non-metric
spaces is more challenging as the idea of computing centroids is not directly
applicable.

In this paper, we present CRS, a novel method for selecting a small yet
representative subset of objects as a cluster prototype. Memory and
computationally efficient selection of representatives is enabled by leveraging
the similarity graph representation of each cluster created by the NN-Descent
algorithm. CRS can be used in an arbitrary metric or non-metric space because
of the graph-based approach, which requires only a pairwise similarity measure.
As we demonstrate in the experimental evaluation, our method outperforms the
state of the art techniques on multiple datasets from different domains.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate traffic state prediction is the foundation of transportation control
and guidance. It is very challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies in traffic data. Existing works cannot perform well for multi-step
traffic prediction that involves long future time period. The spatiotemporal
information dilution becomes serve when the time gap between input step and
predicted step is large, especially when traffic data is not sufficient or
noisy. To address this issue, we propose a multi-spatial graph convolution
based Seq2Seq model. Our main novelties are three aspects: (1) We enrich the
spatiotemporal information of model inputs by fusing multi-view features (time,
location and traffic states) (2) We build multiple kinds of spatial
correlations based on both prior knowledge and data-driven knowledge to improve
model performance especially in insufficient or noisy data cases. (3) A
spatiotemporal attention mechanism based on reachability knowledge is novelly
designed to produce high-level features fed into decoder of Seq2Seq directly to
ease information dilution. Our model is evaluated on two real world traffic
datasets and achieves better performance than other competitors.</span>

Having an elegant way to express these structures can help lessen the
complexity in the management and analysis of their performances together with
the different choices of optimization strategies. With these issues in mind, we
created the AMLP toolkit which facilitates the creation and evaluation of
complex machine learning pipeline structures using simple expressions. We use
AMLP to find optimal pipeline signatures, datamine them, and use these
datamined features to speed-up learning and prediction. We formulated a

classification, few meaningful results exist for imbalanced classification, in
which data are dominated by samples from one of the two classes. Existing
theory faces at least two main challenges. First, meaningful results must
consider more complex performance measures than classification accuracy. To
address this, we characterize a novel generalization of the Bayes-optimal
classifier to any performance metric computed from the confusion matrix, and we
use this to show how relative performance guarantees can be obtained in terms
of the error of estimating the class probability function under uniform
($\mathcal{L}_\infty$) loss. Second, as we show, optimal classification
performance depends on certain properties of class imbalance that have not
previously been formalized. Specifically, we propose a novel sub-type of class
imbalance, which we call Uniform Class Imbalance. We analyze how Uniform Class
Imbalance influences optimal classifier performance and show that it
necessitates different classifier behavior than other types of class imbalance.
We further illustrate these two contributions in the case of $k$-nearest
neighbor classification, for which we develop novel guarantees. Together, these
results provide some of the first meaningful finite-sample statistical theory
for imbalanced binary classification.</span>

as is typically studied in matrix factorization. In this paper, we take a step
further and analyze implicit rank regularization in autoencoders. We show
greedy learning of low-rank latent codes induced by a linear sub-network at the
autoencoder bottleneck. We further propose orthogonal initialization and
principled learning rate adjustment to mitigate sensitivity of training
dynamics to spectral prior and linear depth. With linear autoencoders on
synthetic data, our method converges stably to ground-truth latent code rank.
With nonlinear autoencoders, our method converges to latent ranks optimal for
downstream classification and image sampling.</span>

                                        <span>The so-called block-term decomposition (BTD) tensor model, especially in its
rank-$(L_r,L_r,1)$ version, has been recently receiving increasing attention
due to its enhanced ability of representing systems and signals that are
composed of \emph{blocks} of rank higher than one, a scenario encountered in
numerous and diverse applications. Uniqueness conditions and fitting methods
have thus been thoroughly studied. Nevertheless, the challenging problem of
estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms, $R$, and
their individual ranks, $L_r$, has only recently started to attract significant
attention, mainly through regularization-based approaches which entail the need
to tune the regularization parameter(s). In this work, we build on ideas of
sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and put forward a fully automated Bayesian
approach. Through a suitably crafted multi-level \emph{hierarchical}
probabilistic model, which gives rise to heavy-tailed prior distributions for
the BTD factors, structured sparsity is \emph{jointly} imposed. Ranks are then
estimated from the numbers of blocks ($R$) and columns ($L_r$) of
non-negligible energy. Approximate posterior inference is implemented, within
the variational inference framework. The resulting iterative algorithm
completely avoids hyperparameter tuning, which is a significant defect of
regularization-based methods. Alternative probabilistic models are also
explored and the connections with their regularization-based counterparts are
brought to light with the aid of the associated maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
estimators. We report simulation results with both synthetic and real-word
data, which demonstrate the merits of the proposed method in terms of both rank
estimation and model fitting as compared to state-of-the-art relevant methods.</span>

of feedforward neural networks (FNNs) learning. This method was proposed
recently as a way of improving randomized learning of FNNs by adjusting the
network parameters to the target function fluctuations. The method employs
logistic sigmoid activation functions for hidden nodes. In this study, we
introduce other activation functions, such as bipolar sigmoid, sine function,
saturating linear functions, reLU, and softplus. We derive formulas for their
parameters, i.e. weights and biases. In the simulation study, we evaluate the
performance of FNN data-driven learning with different activation functions.
The results indicate that the sigmoid activation functions perform much better

pulmonary diseases, while is also challenging due to the complicated structure.
In this work, we present an effective framework and refinement process of
pulmonary vessel segmentation from chest computed tomographic (CT) images. The
key to our approach is a 2.5D segmentation network applied from three
orthogonal axes, which presents a robust and fully automated pulmonary vessel
segmentation result with lower network complexity and memory usage compared to
3D networks. The slice radius is introduced to convolve the adjacent
information of the center slice and the multi-planar fusion optimizes the
presentation of intra- and inter- slice features. Besides, the tree-like
structure of the pulmonary vessel is extracted in the post-processing process,
which is used for segmentation refining and pruning. In the evaluation
experiments, three fusion methods are tested and the most promising one is
compared with the state-of-the-art 2D and 3D structures on 300 cases of lung
images randomly selected from LIDC dataset. Our method outperforms other
network structures by a large margin and achieves by far the highest average
DICE score of 0.9272 and precision of 0.9310, as per our knowledge from the
pulmonary vessel segmentation models available in the literature.</span>

                                        <span>Advances in differentiable numerical integrators have enabled the use of
gradient descent techniques to learn ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In
the context of machine learning, differentiable solvers are central for Neural
ODEs (NODEs), a class of deep learning models with continuous depth, rather
than discrete layers. However, these integrators can be unsatisfactorily slow
and inaccurate when learning systems of ODEs from long sequences, or when
solutions of the system vary at widely different timescales in each dimension.
In this paper we propose an alternative approach to learning ODEs from data: we
represent the underlying ODE as a vector field that is related to another base
vector field by a differentiable bijection, modelled by an invertible neural
network. By restricting the base ODE to be amenable to integration, we can
drastically speed up and improve the robustness of integration. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our method in training and evaluating continuous neural
networks models, as well as in learning benchmark ODE systems. We observe
improvements of up to two orders of magnitude when integrating learned ODEs
with GPUs computation.</span>

                                        <span>Deployed machine learning models are confronted with the problem of changing
data over time, a phenomenon also called concept drift. While existing
approaches of concept drift detection already show convincing results, they
require true labels as a prerequisite for successful drift detection.
Especially in many real-world application scenarios-like the ones covered in
this work-true labels are scarce, and their acquisition is expensive.
Therefore, we introduce a new algorithm for drift detection, Uncertainty Drift
Detection (UDD), which is able to detect drifts without access to true labels.
Our approach is based on the uncertainty estimates provided by a deep neural
network in combination with Monte Carlo Dropout. Structural changes over time
are detected by applying the ADWIN technique on the uncertainty estimates, and
detected drifts trigger a retraining of the prediction model. In contrast to
input data-based drift detection, our approach considers the effects of the
current input data on the properties of the prediction model rather than
detecting change on the input data only (which can lead to unnecessary
retrainings). We show that UDD outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies on
two synthetic as well as ten real-world data sets for both regression and
classification tasks.</span>

$d\gg 1$) is a popular problem that has wide applications. In this paper we
study the application of random coordinate descent method (RCD) on the Langevin
Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling method, and we find two sides of the theory:

1. The direct application of RCD on LMC does reduce the number of finite
differencing approximations per iteration, but it induces a large variance
error term. More iterations are then needed, and ultimately the method gains no
computational advantage;

2. When variance reduction techniques (such as SAGA and SVRG) are
incorporated in RCD-LMC, the variance error term is reduced. The new methods,
compared to the vanilla LMC, reduce the total computational cost by $d$ folds,
and achieve the optimal cost rate.

We perform our investigations in both overdamped and underdamped settings.</span>

could benefit various downstream applications such as question answering and
recommender systems. Participants are invited to complete the knowledge graph
by predicting missing triplets. Recent representation learning methods have
achieved great success on standard datasets like FB15k-237. Thus, we train the
advanced algorithms in different domains to learn the triplets, including OTE,
QuatE, RotatE and TransE. Significantly, we modified OTE into NOTE (short for
Norm-OTE) for better performance. Besides, we use both the DeepWalk and the

area of growing significance as commercial and government applications of ML
can draw on multiple sources of data, potentially including users&#x27; and clients&#x27;
sensitive data. We provide a comprehensive survey of contemporary advances on
several fronts, covering involuntary data leakage which is natural to ML
models, potential malevolent leakage which is caused by privacy attacks, and
currently available defence mechanisms. We focus on inference-time leakage, as
the most likely scenario for publicly available models. We first discuss what
leakage is in the context of different data, tasks, and model architectures. We
then propose a taxonomy across involuntary and malevolent leakage, available
defences, followed by the currently available assessment metrics and
applications. We conclude with outstanding challenges and open questions,
outlining some promising directions for future research.</span>

                                        <span>When a population exhibits heterogeneity, we often model it via a finite
mixture: decompose it into several different but homogeneous subpopulations.
Contemporary practice favors learning the mixtures by maximizing the likelihood
for statistical efficiency and the convenient EM-algorithm for numerical
computation. Yet the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is not well defined for
the most widely used finite normal mixture in particular and for finite
location-scale mixture in general. We hence investigate feasible alternatives
to MLE such as minimum distance estimators. Recently, the Wasserstein distance
has drawn increased attention in the machine learning community. It has
intuitive geometric interpretation and is successfully employed in many new
applications. Do we gain anything by learning finite location-scale mixtures
via a minimum Wasserstein distance estimator (MWDE)? This paper investigates
this possibility in several respects. We find that the MWDE is consistent and
derive a numerical solution under finite location-scale mixtures. We study its
robustness against outliers and mild model mis-specifications. Our moderate
scaled simulation study shows the MWDE suffers some efficiency loss against a
penalized version of MLE in general without noticeable gain in robustness. We
reaffirm the general superiority of the likelihood based learning strategies
even for the non-regular finite location-scale mixtures.</span>

widely over the spectrum of dataset qualities, ranging from &quot;far-from-optimal&quot;
random data to &quot;close-to-optimal&quot; expert demonstrations. We re-implement these
under a fair, unified, and highly factorized framework, and show that when a
given baseline outperforms its competing counterparts on one end of the
spectrum, it never does on the other end. This consistent trend prevents us
from naming a victor that outperforms the rest across the board. We attribute
the asymmetry in performance between the two ends of the quality spectrum to
the amount of inductive bias injected into the agent to entice it to posit that
the behavior underlying the offline dataset is optimal for the task. The more
bias is injected, the higher the agent performs, provided the dataset is
close-to-optimal. Otherwise, its effect is brutally detrimental. Adopting an
advantage-weighted regression template as base, we conduct an investigation
which corroborates that injections of such optimality inductive bias, when not
done parsimoniously, makes the agent subpar in the datasets it was dominant as
soon as the offline policy is sub-optimal. In an effort to design methods that
perform well across the whole spectrum, we revisit the generalized policy
iteration scheme for the offline regime, and study the impact of nine distinct
newly-introduced proposal distributions over actions, involved in proposed
generalization of the policy evaluation and policy improvement update rules. We
show that certain orchestrations strike the right balance and can improve the
performance on one end of the spectrum without harming it on the other end.</span>

                                        <span>How can neural networks trained by contrastive learning extract features from
the unlabeled data? Why does contrastive learning usually need much stronger
data augmentations than supervised learning to ensure good representations?
These questions involve both the optimization and statistical aspects of deep
learning, but can hardly be answered by analyzing supervised learning, where
the target functions are the highest pursuit. Indeed, in self-supervised
learning, it is inevitable to relate to the optimization/generalization of
neural networks to how they can encode the latent structures in the data, which
we refer to as the feature learning process.

In this work, we formally study how contrastive learning learns the feature
representations for neural networks by analyzing its feature learning process.
We consider the case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the
more semantically aligned sparse features which we want to learn from, and the
other dense features we want to avoid. Theoretically, we prove that contrastive
learning using $\mathbf{ReLU}$ networks provably learns the desired sparse
features if proper augmentations are adopted. We present an underlying
principle called $\textbf{feature decoupling}$ to explain the effects of
augmentations, where we theoretically characterize how augmentations can reduce
the correlations of dense features between positive samples while keeping the
correlations of sparse features intact, thereby forcing the neural networks to
learn from the self-supervision of sparse features. Empirically, we verified
that the feature decoupling principle matches the underlying mechanism of
contrastive learning in practice.</span>

model emulation using stochastic imputation. By stochastically imputing the
latent layers, the approach transforms the DGP into the linked GP, a
state-of-the-art surrogate model formed by linking a system of feed-forward
coupled GPs. This transformation renders a simple while efficient DGP training
procedure that only involves optimizations of conventional stationary GPs. In
addition, the analytically tractable mean and variance of the linked GP allows
one to implement predictions from DGP emulators in a fast and accurate manner.
We demonstrate the method in a series of synthetic examples and real-world
applications, and show that it is a competitive candidate for efficient DGP
surrogate modeling in comparison to the variational inference and the
fully-Bayesian approach. A $\texttt{Python}$ package $\texttt{dgpsi}$

outlier detection in massive-scale datasets. Unlike the well-known traditional
algorithms, which assume that all the data is memory-resident, our proposed
method is scalable and processes the input data chunk-by-chunk within the
confines of a limited memory buffer. A temporary clustering model is built at
the first phase; then, it is gradually updated by analyzing consecutive memory
loads of points. Subsequently, at the end of scalable clustering, the
approximate structure of the original clusters is obtained. Finally, by another
scan of the entire dataset and using a suitable criterion, an outlying score is
assigned to each object called SDCOR (Scalable Density-based Clustering
Outlierness Ratio). Evaluations on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method has a low linear time complexity and is more effective
and efficient compared to best-known conventional density-based methods, which
need to load all data into the memory; and also, to some fast distance-based
methods, which can perform on data resident in the disk.</span>

engineering systems becomes essential to guarantee the normal work and the
working life of these components. However, prior methods, which mainly use the
interpolate estimation to reconstruct the temperature field from limited
monitoring points, require large amounts of temperature tensors for an accurate
estimation. This may decrease the availability and reliability of the system
and sharply increase the monitoring cost. To solve this problem, this work
develops a novel physics-informed deep reversible regression models for
temperature field reconstruction of heat-source systems (TFR-HSS), which can
better reconstruct the temperature field with limited monitoring points
unsupervisedly. First, we define the TFR-HSS task mathematically, and
numerically model the task, and hence transform the task as an image-to-image
regression problem. Then this work develops the deep reversible regression
model which can better learn the physical information, especially over the
boundary. Finally, considering the physical characteristics of heat conduction
as well as the boundary conditions, this work proposes the physics-informed
reconstruction loss including four training losses and jointly learns the deep
surrogate model with these losses unsupervisedly. Experimental studies have
conducted over typical two-dimensional heat-source systems to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various graph-related
problems such as node classification and graph classification, where the
superior performance is mainly established when natural node features are
available. However, it is not well understood how GNNs work without natural
node features, especially regarding the various ways to construct artificial
ones. In this paper, we point out the two types of artificial node
features,i.e., positional and structural node features, and provide insights on
why each of them is more appropriate for certain tasks,i.e., positional node
classification, structural node classification, and graph classification.
Extensive experimental results on 10 benchmark datasets validate our insights,
thus leading to a practical guideline on the choices between different
artificial node features for GNNs on non-attributed graphs. The code is

performing complex sequential tasks like playing Atari games, Go and Poker.
These algorithms have outperformed humans in several tasks by learning from
scratch, using only scalar rewards obtained through interaction with their
environment. While there certainly has been considerable independent innovation
to produce such results, many core ideas in reinforcement learning are inspired
by phenomena in animal learning, psychology and neuroscience. In this paper, we
comprehensively review a large number of findings in both neuroscience and
psychology that evidence reinforcement learning as a promising candidate for
modeling learning and decision making in the brain. In doing so, we construct a
mapping between various classes of modern RL algorithms and specific findings
in both neurophysiological and behavioral literature. We then discuss the
implications of this observed relationship between RL, neuroscience and

                                        <span>Single-pixel imaging is a novel imaging scheme that has gained popularity due
to its huge computational gain and potential for a low-cost alternative to
imaging beyond the visible spectrum. The traditional reconstruction methods
struggle to produce a clear recovery when one limits the number of illumination
patterns from a spatial light modulator. As a remedy, several
deep-learning-based solutions have been proposed which lack good generalization
ability due to the architectural setup and loss functions. In this paper, we
propose a generative adversarial network-based reconstruction framework for
single-pixel imaging, referred to as SPI-GAN. Our method can reconstruct images
with 17.92 dB PSNR and 0.487 SSIM, even if the sampling ratio drops to 5%. This
facilitates much faster reconstruction making our method suitable for
single-pixel video. Furthermore, our ResNet-like architecture for the generator
leads to useful representation learning that allows us to reconstruct
completely unseen objects. The experimental results demonstrate that SPI-GAN
achieves significant performance gain, e.g. near 3dB PSNR gain, over the
current state-of-the-art method.</span>

augmentation, knowledge transfer, pruning, and quantization for device-robust

pruning mechanism, namely Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), to find a

assessed by investigating various data augmentation and compression schemes,

efficient implementation both assume the ridge parameter is near 0 in the ridge
inverse to approximate the generalized inverse, and compute the generalized
inverse solution for the output weights. In this paper, we propose two ridge
solutions for the output weights in the BLS on added nodes, where the ridge
parameter can be any positive real number. One of the proposed ridge solutions
computes the output weights from the inverse Cholesky factor, which is updated
by extending the existing inverse Cholesky factorization. The other proposed
ridge solution computes the output weights from the ridge inverse, and updates
the ridge inverse by extending the Greville method that can only computes the
generalized inverse of a partitioned matrix. The proposed BLS algorithm based
on the ridge inverse requires the same complexity as the original BLS
algorithm, while the proposed BLS algorithm based on the inverse Cholesky
factor requires less complexity and training time than the original BLS and the
existing efficient BLS. Both the proposed ridge solutions for BLS achieve the
same testing accuracy as the standard ridge solution in the numerical
experiments. The difference between the testing accuracy of the proposed ridge
solutions and that of the existing generalized inverse solutions is negligible
when the ridge parameter is very small, and becomes too big to be ignored when
the ridge parameter is not very small. When the ridge parameter is not near 0,
usually the proposed two ridge solutions for BLS achieve better testing
accuracy than the existing generalized inverse solutions for BLS, and then the
former are more preferred than the latter.</span>

lies in its &quot;live&quot; component. In this paper, we leverage data from a large
livestreaming platform to examine this belief. We are able to do this as this
platform also allows viewers to purchase the recorded version of the
livestream. We summarize the value of livestreaming content by estimating how
demand responds to price before, on the day of, and after the livestream. We do
this by proposing a generalized Orthogonal Random Forest framework. This
framework allows us to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence
of high-dimensional confounders whose relationships with the treatment policy
(i.e., price) are complex but partially known. We find significant dynamics in
the price elasticity of demand over the temporal distance to the scheduled
livestreaming day and after. Specifically, demand gradually becomes less price
sensitive over time to the livestreaming day and is inelastic on the
livestreaming day. Over the post-livestream period, demand is still sensitive
to price, but much less than the pre-livestream period. This indicates that the
vlaue of livestreaming persists beyond the live component. Finally, we provide
suggestive evidence for the likely mechanisms driving our results. These are
quality uncertainty reduction for the patterns pre- and post-livestream and the
potential of real-time interaction with the creator on the day of the
livestream.</span>

                                        <span>Detecting latent structure within a dataset is a crucial step in performing
analysis of a dataset. However, existing state-of-the-art techniques for
subclass discovery are limited: either they are limited to detecting very small
numbers of outliers or they lack the statistical power to deal with complex
data such as image or audio. This paper proposes a solution to this subclass
discovery problem: by leveraging instance explanation methods, an existing
classifier can be extended to detect latent classes via differences in the
classifier&#x27;s internal decisions about each instance. This works not only with
simple classification techniques but also with deep neural networks, allowing
for a powerful and flexible approach to detecting latent structure within
datasets. Effectively, this represents a projection of the dataset into the
classifier&#x27;s &quot;explanation space,&quot; and preliminary results show that this
technique outperforms the baseline for the detection of latent classes even
with limited processing. This paper also contains a pipeline for analyzing
classifiers automatically, and a web application for interactively exploring
the results from this technique.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple distributed clients (e.g., mobile
devices) to collaboratively train a centralized model while keeping the
training data locally on the client. Compared to traditional centralized
machine learning, FL offers many favorable features such as offloading
operations which would usually be performed by a central server and reducing
risks of serious privacy leakage. However, Byzantine clients that send
incorrect or disruptive updates due to system failures or adversarial attacks
may disturb the joint learning process, consequently degrading the performance
of the resulting model. In this paper, we propose to mitigate these failures
and attacks from a spatial-temporal perspective. Specifically, we use a
clustering-based method to detect and exclude incorrect updates by leveraging
their geometric properties in the parameter space. Moreover, to further handle
malicious clients with time-varying behaviors, we propose to adaptively adjust
the learning rate according to momentum-based update speculation. Extensive
experiments on 4 public datasets demonstrate that our algorithm achieves
enhanced robustness comparing to existing methods under both cross-silo and
cross-device FL settings with faulty/malicious clients.</span>

a shared machine learning model through exchanging parameter information.
Despite the fact that FL can protect clients&#x27; raw data, malicious users can
still crack original data with disclosed parameters. To amend this flaw,
differential privacy (DP) is incorporated into FL clients to disturb original
parameters, which however can significantly impair the accuracy of the trained
model. In this work, we study a crucial question which has been vastly
overlooked by existing works: what are the optimal numbers of queries and
replies in FL with DP so that the final model accuracy is maximized. In FL, the
parameter server (PS) needs to query participating clients for multiple global
iterations to complete training. Each client responds a query from the PS by
conducting a local iteration. Our work investigates how many times the PS
should query clients and how many times each client should reply the PS. We
investigate two most extensively used DP mechanisms (i.e., the Laplace
mechanism and Gaussian mechanisms). Through conducting convergence rate
analysis, we can determine the optimal numbers of queries and replies in FL
with DP so that the final model accuracy can be maximized. Finally, extensive
experiments are conducted with publicly available datasets: MNIST and FEMNIST,
to verify our analysis and the results demonstrate that properly setting the
numbers of queries and replies can significantly improve the final model
accuracy in FL with DP.</span>

cluster a set of images into an unknown number of identities using a training
set of images annotated with labels belonging to a disjoint set of identities.
Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components
predicted at each level of the hierarchy to form a new graph at the next level.
Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and
complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The
resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score
and 8% increase in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) relative to current
GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based
methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node
densities as intermediate steps of the clustering process. In contrast, our
unified framework achieves a seven-fold decrease in computational cost. We

                                        <span>Random dimensionality reduction is a versatile tool for speeding up
algorithms for high-dimensional problems. We study its application to two
clustering problems: the facility location problem, and the single-linkage
hierarchical clustering problem, which is equivalent to computing the minimum
spanning tree. We show that if we project the input pointset $X$ onto a random
$d &#x3D; O(d_X)$-dimensional subspace (where $d_X$ is the doubling dimension of
$X$), then the optimum facility location cost in the projected space
approximates the original cost up to a constant factor. We show an analogous
statement for minimum spanning tree, but with the dimension $d$ having an extra
$\log \log n$ term and the approximation factor being arbitrarily close to $1$.
Furthermore, we extend these results to approximating solutions instead of just
their costs. Lastly, we provide experimental results to validate the quality of
solutions and the speedup due to the dimensionality reduction. Unlike several
previous papers studying this approach in the context of $k$-means and
$k$-medians, our dimension bound does not depend on the number of clusters but
only on the intrinsic dimensionality of $X$.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems (RSs) have emerged as very useful tools to help customers
with their decision-making process, find items of their interest, and alleviate
the information overload problem. There are two different lines of approaches
in RSs: (1) general recommenders with the main goal of discovering long-term
users&#x27; preferences, and (2) sequential recommenders with the main focus of
capturing short-term users&#x27; preferences in a session of user-item interaction
(here, a session refers to a record of purchasing multiple items in one
shopping event). While considering short-term users&#x27; preferences may satisfy
their current needs and interests, long-term users&#x27; preferences provide users
with the items that they may interact with, eventually. In this thesis, we
first focus on improving the performance of general RSs. Most of the existing
general RSs tend to exploit the users&#x27; rating patterns on common items to
detect similar users. The data sparsity problem (i.e. the lack of available
information) is one of the major challenges for the current general RSs, and
they may fail to have any recommendations when there are no common items of
interest among users. We call this problem data sparsity with no feedback on
common items (DSW-n-FCI). To overcome this problem, we propose a
personality-based RS in which similar users are identified based on the
similarity of their personality traits.</span>

have long been used to understand the functional organization of the brain.
Nevertheless, a connectome is intrinsically linked to the atlas used to create
it. In other words, a connectome generated from one atlas is different in scale
and resolution compared to a connectome generated from another atlas. Being
able to map connectomes and derived results between different atlases without
additional pre-processing is a crucial step in improving interpretation and
generalization between studies that use different atlases. Here, we use optimal
transport, a powerful mathematical technique, to find an optimum mapping
between two atlases. This mapping is then used to transform time series from
one atlas to another in order to reconstruct a connectome. We validate our
approach by comparing transformed connectomes against their &quot;gold-standard&quot;
counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas) and
demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes by applying these
connectomes to predictive models based on a different atlas. We show that these
transformed connectomes are significantly similar to their &quot;gold-standard&quot;
counterparts and maintain individual differences in brain-behavior
associations, demonstrating both the validity of our approach and its utility
in downstream analyses. Overall, our approach is a promising avenue to increase
the generalization of connectome-based results across different atlases.</span>

ecological and social sciences. Despite efforts to conduct such surveys in a
standardized way, observations can be prone to systematic measurement errors.
The removal of systematic variability introduced by the observation process, if
possible, can greatly increase the value of this data. Existing non-parametric
techniques for correcting such errors assume linear additive noise models. This
leads to biased estimates when applied to generalized linear models (GLM). We

                                        <span>Nowadays, most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models 1) are
developed for synthetically-distorted images and often generalize poorly to
authentic ones; 2) heavily rely on human ratings, which are prohibitively
labor-expensive to collect. Here, we propose an $opinion$-$free$ BIQA method
that learns from synthetically-distorted images and multiple agents to assess
the perceptual quality of authentically-distorted ones captured in the wild
without relying on human labels. Specifically, we first assemble a large number
of image pairs from synthetically-distorted images and use a set of
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models to assign pseudo-binary
labels of each pair indicating which image has higher quality as the
supervisory signal. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
BIQA model to rank the perceptual quality, optimized for consistency with the
binary labels. Since there exists domain shift between the synthetically- and
authentically-distorted images, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) module
is introduced to alleviate this issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed $opinion$-$free$ BIQA model, yielding
state-of-the-art performance in terms of correlation with human opinion scores,
as well as gMAD competition. Codes will be made publicly available upon
acceptance.</span>

augmentation, knowledge transfer, pruning, and quantization for device-robust
acoustic scene classification (ASC). Specifically, we tackle the ASC task in a
low-resource environment leveraging a recently proposed advanced neural network
pruning mechanism, namely Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), to find a
sub-network neural model associated with a small amount non-zero model
parameters. The effectiveness of LTH for low-complexity acoustic modeling is
assessed by investigating various data augmentation and compression schemes,
and we report an efficient joint framework for low-complexity multi-device ASC,
called Acoustic Lottery. Acoustic Lottery could compress an ASC model over
$1/10^{4}$ and attain a superior performance (validation accuracy of 74.01% and
Log loss of 0.76) compared to its not compressed seed model. All results
reported in this work are based on a joint effort of four groups, namely

                                        <span>The distortion in steganography that usually comes from the modification or
recoding on the cover image during the embedding process leaves the
steganalyzer with possibility of discriminating. Faced with such a risk, we
propose generative steganography with Kerckhoffs&#x27; principle (GSK) in this
letter. In GSK, the secret messages are generated by a cover image using a
generator rather than embedded into the cover, thus resulting in no
modifications in the cover. To ensure the security, the generators are trained
to meet Kerckhoffs&#x27; principle based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).
Everything about the GSK system, except the extraction key, is public knowledge
for the receivers. The secret messages can be outputted by the generator if and
only if the extraction key and the cover image are both inputted. In the
generator training procedures, there are two GANs, Message- GAN and Cover-GAN,
designed to work jointly making the generated results under the control of the
extraction key and the cover image. We provide experimental results on the
training process and give an example of the working process by adopting a
generator trained on MNIST, which demonstrate that GSK can use a cover image
without any modification to generate messages, and without the extraction key
or the cover image, only meaningless results would be obtained.</span>

individual into audiovisual streams of potentially-infinitely many output
speakers. Our approach builds on simple autoencoders that project out-of-sample
data onto the distribution of the training set. We use Exemplar Autoencoders to
learn the voice, stylistic prosody, and visual appearance of a specific target
exemplar speech. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed approach can be
easily extended to an arbitrarily large number of speakers and styles using
only 3 minutes of target audio-video data, without requiring {\em any} training
data for the input speaker. To do so, we learn audiovisual bottleneck
representations that capture the structured linguistic content of speech. We
outperform prior approaches on both audio and video synthesis, and provide
extensive qualitative analysis on our project page --

answer questions related to them. In practice, the conversation is an essential
way to communicate and transfer information. To help machines understand
conversation texts, we present UIT-ViCoQA, a new corpus for conversational
machine reading comprehension in the Vietnamese language. This corpus consists
of 10,000 questions with answers over 2,000 conversations about health news
articles. Then, we evaluate several baseline approaches for conversational
machine comprehension on the UIT-ViCoQA corpus. The best model obtains an F1
score of 45.27%, which is 30.91 points behind human performance (76.18%),
indicating that there is ample room for improvement. Our dataset is available

                                        <span>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies today are primarily optimized
for given datasets; thus, any changes in the application environment (e.g.,
acoustic conditions or topic domains) may inevitably degrade the performance.
We can collect new data describing the new environment and fine-tune the
system, but this naturally leads to higher error rates for the earlier
datasets, referred to as catastrophic forgetting. The concept of lifelong
learning (LLL) aiming to enable a machine to sequentially learn new tasks from
new datasets describing the changing real world without forgetting the
previously learned knowledge is thus brought to attention. This paper reports,
to our knowledge, the first effort to extensively consider and analyze the use
of various approaches of LLL in end-to-end (E2E) ASR, including proposing novel
methods in saving data for past domains to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting
problem. An overall relative reduction of 28.7% in WER was achieved compared to
the fine-tuning baseline when sequentially learning on three very different
benchmark corpora. This can be the first step toward the highly desired ASR
technologies capable of synchronizing with the continuously changing real
world.</span>

Due to their irregular pronunciation compared to native German words,
automatically generated pronunciation dictionaries often include faulty phoneme
sequences for Anglicisms. In this work, we propose a multitask
sequence-to-sequence approach for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion to improve the
phonetization of Anglicisms. We extended a grapheme-to-phoneme model with a
classifier to distinguish Anglicisms from native German words. With this
approach, the model learns to generate pronunciations differently depending on
the classification result. We used our model to create supplementary Anglicism
pronunciation dictionaries that are added to an existing German speech
recognition model. Tested on a dedicated Anglicism evaluation set, we improved
the recognition of Anglicisms compared to a baseline model, reducing the word
error rate by 1 % and the Anglicism error rate by 3 %. We show that multitask
learning can help solving the challenge of loanwords in German speech
recognition.</span>

                                        <span>State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid
subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and
adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive
bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To
this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)
that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a
data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and
learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.
We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates
GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,
multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a
series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par
and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is
fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level
Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this
work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained
completely end-to-end.</span>

pluralism and consistently represent major and minor social groups. Currently,
there are no standard evaluation techniques for different types of biases.
Accordingly, there is an urgent need to provide evaluation sets and protocols
to measure existing biases in our automatic systems. Evaluating the biases
should be an essential step towards mitigating them in the systems.

This paper introduces WinoST, a new freely available challenge set for
evaluating gender bias in speech translation. WinoST is the speech version of
WinoMT which is a MT challenge set and both follow an evaluation protocol to
measure gender accuracy. Using a state-of-the-art end-to-end speech translation
system, we report the gender bias evaluation on four language pairs and we show
that gender accuracy in speech translation is more than 23% lower than in MT.</span>

                                        <span>The end-to-end architecture has made promising progress in speech translation
(ST). However, the ST task is still challenging under low-resource conditions.
Most ST models have shown unsatisfactory results, especially in the absence of
word information from the source speech utterance. In this study, we survey
methods to improve ST performance without using source transcription, and
propose a learning framework that utilizes a language-independent universal
phone recognizer. The framework is based on an attention-based
sequence-to-sequence model, where the encoder generates the phonetic embeddings
and phone-aware acoustic representations, and the decoder controls the fusion
of the two embedding streams to produce the target token sequence. In addition
to investigating different fusion strategies, we explore the specific usage of
byte pair encoding (BPE), which compresses a phone sequence into a
syllable-like segmented sequence. Due to the conversion of symbols, a segmented
sequence represents not only pronunciation but also language-dependent
information lacking in phones. Experiments conducted on the Fisher
Spanish-English and Taigi-Mandarin drama corpora show that our method
outperforms the conformer-based baseline, and the performance is close to that
of the existing best method using source transcription.</span>

                                        <span>With the rapid development of NLP research, leaderboards have emerged as one
tool to track the performance of various systems on various NLP tasks. They are
effective in this goal to some extent, but generally present a rather
simplistic one-dimensional view of the submitted systems, communicated only
through holistic accuracy numbers. In this paper, we present a new
conceptualization and implementation of NLP evaluation: the ExplainaBoard,
which in addition to inheriting the functionality of the standard leaderboard,
also allows researchers to (i) diagnose strengths and weaknesses of a single
system (e.g.~what is the best-performing system bad at?) (ii) interpret
relationships between multiple systems. (e.g.~where does system A outperform
system B? What if we combine systems A, B, and C?) and (iii) examine prediction
results closely (e.g.~what are common errors made by multiple systems, or in
what contexts do particular errors occur?). So far, ExplainaBoard covers more
than 400 systems, 50 datasets, 40 languages, and 12 tasks. ExplainaBoard keeps
updated and is recently upgraded by supporting (1) multilingual multi-task
benchmark, (2) meta-evaluation, and (3) more complicated task: machine
translation, which reviewers also suggested.} We not only released an online
platform on the website \url{this http URL} but also make
our evaluation tool an API with MIT Licence at Github
\url{https://github.com/neulab/explainaBoard} and PyPi
\url{https://pypi.org/project/interpret-eval/} that allows users to
conveniently assess their models offline. We additionally release all output
files from systems that we have run or collected to motivate &quot;output-driven&quot;
research in the future.</span>

that are already marginalized. In this paper, I will make a case for thinking
about ethical considerations not just at the level of individual models and
datasets, but also at the level of AI tasks. I will present a new form of such
an effort, Ethics Sheets for AI Tasks, dedicated to fleshing out the
assumptions and ethical considerations hidden in how a task is commonly framed
and in the choices we make regarding the data, method, and evaluation. Finally,
I will provide an example ethics sheet for automatic emotion recognition.
Together with Data Sheets for datasets and Model Cards for AI systems, Ethics
Sheets aid in the development and deployment of responsible AI systems.</span>

                                        <span>Sequence learning has attracted much research attention from the machine
learning community in recent years. In many applications, a sequence learning
task is usually associated with multiple temporally correlated auxiliary tasks,
which are different in terms of how much input information to use or which
future step to predict. For example, (i) in simultaneous machine translation,
one can conduct translation under different latency (i.e., how many input words
to read/wait before translation); (ii) in stock trend forecasting, one can
predict the price of a stock in different future days (e.g., tomorrow, the day
after tomorrow). While it is clear that those temporally correlated tasks can
help each other, there is a very limited exploration on how to better leverage
multiple auxiliary tasks to boost the performance of the main task. In this
work, we introduce a learnable scheduler to sequence learning, which can
adaptively select auxiliary tasks for training depending on the model status
and the current training data. The scheduler and the model for the main task
are jointly trained through bi-level optimization. Experiments show that our
method significantly improves the performance of simultaneous machine
translation and stock trend forecasting.</span>

                                        <span>Sender-receiver interactions, and specifically persuasion games, are widely
researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence, and serve as a
solid foundation for powerful applications. However, in the classic persuasion
games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the decision-maker are
abstract or well-structured application-specific signals rather than natural
(human) language messages, although natural language is a very common
communication signal in real-world persuasion setups. This paper addresses the
use of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact on the
decisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the
prediction of these decisions. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated
interaction experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert
aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her
a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several
scored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the
expert, and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw
from the review score distribution available to the expert only. The expert&#x27;s
payoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker chooses the
hotel. We consider a number of modeling approaches for this setup, differing
from each other in the model type (deep neural network (DNN) vs. linear
classifier), the type of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or
both) and the source of the textual features (DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our
results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models
can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a
sequential modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied.</span>

contextual primitives employed in various use cases, e.g., text dimension
reduction, i.e., replace words with the concepts to reduce the vocabulary size,
summarization, and named entity resolution. We demonstrate the first results of
an unsupervised approach for the identification of groups of persons as actors

mentions of groups of persons that act as non-named entity actors in the texts,
e.g., &quot;migrant families&quot; &#x3D; &quot;asylum-seekers.&quot; Compared to our baseline, the
approach keeps the mentions of the geopolitical entities separated, e.g., &quot;Iran

methods are: keyword extraction, word clouds, predicting
declining/stagnant/growing trends using Productivity, tracking bi-grams using
Acceleration plots, finding the Semantic Drift of words, tracking trends using
similarity, etc. To demonstrate the utility and efficacy of our tool, we
perform a case study on the cs.CL corpus of the arXiv repository and draw

Language Processing applications. Diachronic word embeddings (time-sensitive
vector representations of words that preserve their meaning) have become the
standard resource for this task. However, given the significant computational
resources needed for their generation, very few resources exist that make
diachronic word embeddings available to the scientific community.

In this paper we present DUKweb, a set of large-scale resources designed for
the diachronic analysis of contemporary English. DUKweb was created from the
JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996-2013), a very large archive which collects
resources from the Internet Archive that were hosted on domains ending in
&#x60;.uk&#x27;. DUKweb consists of a series word co-occurrence matrices and two types of

of study in recent years. Social media messages are predominantly in code mixed
in non-English speaking states. Prior knowledge by pre-training contextual
embeddings have shown state of the art results for a range of downstream tasks.
Recently, models such as BERT have shown that using a large amount of unlabeled
data, the pretrained language models are even more beneficial for learning
common language representations. Extensive experiments exploiting transfer
learning and fine-tuning BERT models to identify language on Twitter are
presented in this paper. The work utilizes a data collection of
Hindi-English-Urdu codemixed text for language pre-training and Hindi-English
codemixed for subsequent word-level language classification. The results show
that the representations pre-trained over codemixed data produce better results

(e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) with increasing levels of abstraction
that can be hierarchically combined. However, existing deep models with stacked
layers do not explicitly model any sort of hierarchical process. This paper
proposes a recursive Transformer model based on differentiable CKY style binary
trees to emulate the composition process. We extend the bidirectional language
model pre-training objective to this architecture, attempting to predict each
word given its left and right abstraction nodes. To scale up our approach, we
also introduce an efficient pruned tree induction algorithm to enable encoding
in just a linear number of composition steps. Experimental results on language

                                        <span>An intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) enables effortless conversations in
call routing through spoken utterance classification (SUC) which is a special
form of spoken language understanding (SLU). Building a SUC system requires a
large amount of supervised in-domain data that is not always available. In this
paper, we introduce an unsupervised spoken utterance classification approach
(USUC) that does not require any in-domain data except for the intent labels
and a few para-phrases per intent. USUC is consisting of a KNN classifier (K&#x3D;1)
and a complex embedding model trained on a large amount of unsupervised
customer service corpus. Among all embedding models, we demonstrate that Elmo
works best for USUC. However, an Elmo model is too slow to be used at run-time
for call routing. To resolve this issue, first, we compute the uni- and bi-gram
embedding vectors offline and we build a lookup table of n-grams and their
corresponding embedding vector. Then we use this table to compute sentence
embedding vectors at run-time, along with back-off techniques for unseen
n-grams. Experiments show that USUC outperforms the traditional utterance
classification methods by reducing the classification error rate from 32.9% to
27.0% without requiring supervised data. Moreover, our lookup and back-off
technique increases the processing speed from 16 utterances per second to 118
utterances per second.</span>

                                        <span>Building embodied autonomous agents capable of participating in social
interactions with humans is one of the main challenges in AI. Within the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) field, this objective motivated multiple works on
embodied language use. However, current approaches focus on language as a
communication tool in very simplified and non-diverse social situations: the
&quot;naturalness&quot; of language is reduced to the concept of high vocabulary size and
variability. In this paper, we argue that aiming towards human-level AI
requires a broader set of key social skills: 1) language use in complex and
variable social contexts; 2) beyond language, complex embodied communication in
multimodal settings within constantly evolving social worlds. We explain how
concepts from cognitive sciences could help AI to draw a roadmap towards
human-like intelligence, with a focus on its social dimensions. As a first
step, we propose to expand current research to a broader set of core social
skills. To do this, we present SocialAI, a benchmark to assess the acquisition
of social skills of DRL agents using multiple grid-world environments featuring
other (scripted) social agents. We then study the limits of a recent SOTA DRL
approach when tested on SocialAI and discuss important next steps towards
proficient social agents. Videos and code are available at

                                        <span>While pretrained language models achieve excellent performance on natural
language understanding benchmarks, they tend to rely on spurious correlations
and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recent work has
explored using counterfactually-augmented data (CAD) -- data generated by
minimally perturbing examples to flip the ground-truth label -- to identify
robust features that are invariant under distribution shift. However, empirical
results using CAD for OOD generalization have been mixed. To explain this
discrepancy, we draw insights from a linear Gaussian model and demonstrate the
pitfalls of CAD. Specifically, we show that (a) while CAD is effective at
identifying robust features, it may prevent the model from learning unperturbed
robust features, and (b) CAD may exacerbate existing spurious correlations in
the data. Our results show that the lack of perturbation diversity in current
CAD datasets limits its effectiveness on OOD generalization, calling for
innovative crowdsourcing procedures to elicit diverse perturbation of examples.</span>

                                        <span>A major challenge in deploying transformer models is their prohibitive
inference cost, which quadratically scales with the input sequence length. This
makes it especially difficult to use transformers for processing long
sequences. To address this, we present a novel Learned Token Pruning (LTP)
method that reduces redundant tokens as the data passes through the different
layers of the transformer. In particular, LTP prunes tokens with an attention
score below a threshold value, which is learned during training. Importantly,
our threshold based method avoids algorithmically expensive operations such as
top-k token selection which are used in prior token pruning methods, and also
leads to structured pruning. We extensively test the performance of our
approach on multiple GLUE tasks and show that our learned threshold based
method consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art top-k token based
method by up to ~2% higher accuracy with the same amount of FLOPs. Furthermore,
our preliminary results show up to 1.4x and 1.9x throughput improvement on
Tesla T4 GPU and Intel Haswell CPU, respectively, with less than 1% of accuracy
drop (and up to 2.1x FLOPs reduction). Our code has been developed in PyTorch
and has been open-sourced.</span>

naturally through language. This is because understanding human instructions is
complicated by various ambiguities and missing information. In existing
methods, the referring expressions that specify the relationships between

UNITER, which learns the relationship between the target object and other
objects directly by focusing on the relevant regions within an image, rather
than the whole image. Our method is an extension of the UNITER-based
Transformer that can be pretrained on general-purpose datasets. We extend the
UNITER approach by introducing a new architecture for handling the target

                                        <span>Multi-hop machine reading comprehension is a challenging task in natural
language processing, which requires more reasoning ability and explainability.
Spectral models based on graph convolutional networks grant the inferring
abilities and lead to competitive results, however, part of them still face the
challenge of analyzing the reasoning in a human-understandable way. Inspired by
the concept of the Grandmother Cells in cognitive neuroscience, a spatial graph
attention framework named crname, imitating the procedure was proposed. This
model is designed to assemble the semantic features in multi-angle
representations and automatically concentrate or alleviate the information for
reasoning. The name &quot;crname&quot; is a metaphor for the pattern of the model: regard
the subjects of queries as the start points of clues, take the reasoning
entities as bridge points, and consider the latent candidate entities as the
grandmother cells, and the clues end up in candidate entities. The proposed
model allows us to visualize the reasoning graph and analyze the importance of
edges connecting two entities and the selectivity in the mention and candidate
nodes, which can be easier to be comprehended empirically. The official
evaluations in open-domain multi-hop reading dataset WikiHop and Drug-drug
Interactions dataset MedHop prove the validity of our approach and show the
probability of the application of the model in the molecular biology domain.</span>

                                        <span>Millions of people use platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and
other mass media. Due to the accessibility of these platforms, they are often
used to establish a narrative, conduct propaganda, and disseminate
misinformation. This work proposes an approach that uses state-of-the-art NLP
techniques to extract features from video captions (subtitles). To evaluate our
approach, we utilize a publicly accessible and labeled dataset for classifying
videos as misinformation or not. The motivation behind exploring video captions
stems from our analysis of videos metadata. Attributes such as the number of
views, likes, dislikes, and comments are ineffective as videos are hard to
differentiate using this information. Using caption dataset, the proposed
models can classify videos among three classes (Misinformation, Debunking
Misinformation, and Neutral) with 0.85 to 0.90 F1-score. To emphasize the
relevance of the misinformation class, we re-formulate our classification
problem as a two-class classification - Misinformation vs. others (Debunking
Misinformation and Neutral). In our experiments, the proposed models can
classify videos with 0.92 to 0.95 F1-score and 0.78 to 0.90 AUC ROC.</span>

Although BERT obtains a strong performance on most datasets, it does so by
exploiting common surface patterns that correlate with certain factuality
labels, and it fails on instances where pragmatic reasoning is necessary.
Contrary to what the high performance suggests, we are still far from having a
robust system for factuality prediction.</span>

have emerged as a viable option for bringing the power of pretraining to a
large number of languages. Given their success in zero shot transfer learning,
there has emerged a large body of work in (i) building bigger MLLMs covering a
large number of languages (ii) creating exhaustive benchmarks covering a wider
variety of tasks and languages for evaluating MLLMs (iii) analysing the
performance of MLLMs on monolingual, zero shot crosslingual and bilingual tasks
(iv) understanding the universal language patterns (if any) learnt by MLLMs and
(v) augmenting the (often) limited capacity of MLLMs to improve their
performance on seen or even unseen languages. In this survey, we review the
existing literature covering the above broad areas of research pertaining to
MLLMs. Based on our survey, we recommend some promising directions of future

of visual speech recognition systems using user input to compensate for the
inherent ambiguity of the task. Unlike most phoneme-to-word decoding pipelines,
which produce phonemes and feed these through a finite state transducer, our
method instead expands words in lockstep, facilitating the insertion of
interaction points at each word position. Interaction points enable us to
solicit input during decoding, allowing users to interactively direct the
decoding process. We simulate the behavior of user input using an oracle to
give an automated evaluation, and show promise for the use of this method for
text input.</span>

                                        <span>The Transformer model is widely used in natural language processing for
sentence representation. However, the previous Transformer-based models focus
on function words that have limited meaning in most cases and could merely
extract high-level semantic abstraction features. In this paper, two approaches
are introduced to improve the performance of Transformers. We calculated the
attention score by multiplying the part-of-speech weight vector with the
correlation coefficient, which helps extract the words with more practical
meaning. The weight vector is obtained by the input text sequence based on the
importance of the part-of-speech. Furthermore, we fuse the features of each
layer to make the sentence representation results more comprehensive and
accurate. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model
Transformer-F on three standard text classification datasets. Experimental
results show that our proposed model significantly boosts the performance of
text classification as compared to the baseline model. Specifically, we obtain
a 5.28% relative improvement over the vanilla Transformer on the simple tasks.</span>

                                        <span>In pursuit of explainability, we develop generative models for sequential
data. The proposed models provide state-of-the-art classification results and
robust performance for speech phone classification. We combine modern neural
networks (normalizing flows) and traditional generative models (hidden Markov
models - HMMs). Normalizing flow-based mixture models (NMMs) are used to model
the conditional probability distribution given the hidden state in the HMMs.
Model parameters are learned through judicious combinations of time-tested
Bayesian learning methods and contemporary neural network learning methods. We
mainly combine expectation-maximization (EM) and mini-batch gradient descent.
The proposed generative models can compute likelihood of a data and hence
directly suitable for maximum-likelihood (ML) classification approach. Due to
structural flexibility of HMMs, we can use different normalizing flow models.
This leads to different types of HMMs providing diversity in data modeling
capacity. The diversity provides an opportunity for easy decision fusion from
different models. For a standard speech phone classification setup involving 39
phones (classes) and the TIMIT dataset, we show that the use of standard
features called mel-frequency-cepstral-coeffcients (MFCCs), the proposed
generative models, and the decision fusion together can achieve $86.6\%$
accuracy by generative training only. This result is close to state-of-the-art
results, for examples, $86.2\%$ accuracy of PyTorch-Kaldi toolkit [1], and
$85.1\%$ accuracy using light gated recurrent units [2]. We do not use any
discriminative learning approach and related sophisticated features in this

                                        <span>Joint Energy-based Model (JEM) of Grathwohl et al. shows that a standard
softmax classifier can be reinterpreted as an energy-based model (EBM) for the
joint distribution p(x,y); the resulting model can be optimized to improve
calibration, robustness, and out-of-distribution detection, while generating
samples rivaling the quality of recent GAN-based approaches. However, the
softmax classifier that JEM exploits is inherently discriminative and its
latent feature space is not well formulated as probabilistic distributions,
which may hinder its potential for image generation and incur training
instability. We hypothesize that generative classifiers, such as Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), might be more suitable for image generation since
generative classifiers model the data generation process explicitly. This paper
therefore investigates an LDA classifier for image classification and
generation. In particular, the Max-Mahalanobis Classifier (MMC), a special case
of LDA, fits our goal very well. We show that our Generative MMC (GMMC) can be
trained discriminatively, generatively, or jointly for image classification and
generation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that GMMC achieves
state-of-the-art discriminative and generative performances, while
outperforming JEM in calibration, adversarial robustness, and
out-of-distribution detection by a significant margin. Our source code is

objects, plays a critical role in a broad range of practical applications,
e.g., visual effect assistance in movie, scene understanding in autonomous
driving, and virtual background creation in video conferencing, to name a few.
Recently, due to the renaissance of connectionism in computer vision, there has
been an influx of numerous deep learning based approaches that have been
dedicated to video segmentation and delivered compelling performance. In this
survey, we comprehensively review two basic lines of research in this area,
i.e., generic object segmentation (of unknown categories) in videos and video
semantic segmentation, by introducing their respective task settings,
background concepts, perceived need, development history, and main challenges.
We also provide a detailed overview of representative literature on both
methods and datasets. Additionally, we present quantitative performance
comparisons of the reviewed methods on benchmark datasets. At last, we point
out a set of unsolved open issues in this field, and suggest possible
opportunities for further research.</span>

                                        <span>Active fire detection in satellite imagery is of critical importance to the
management of environmental conservation policies, supporting decision-making
and law enforcement. This is a well established field, with many techniques
being proposed over the years, usually based on pixel or region-level
comparisons involving sensor-specific thresholds and neighborhood statistics.
In this paper, we address the problem of active fire detection using deep
learning techniques. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been
enjoying an enormous success in many fields, but their use for active fire
detection is relatively new, with open questions and demand for datasets and
architectures for evaluation. This paper addresses these issues by introducing
a new large-scale dataset for active fire detection, with over 150,000 image
patches (more than 200 GB of data) extracted from Landsat-8 images captured
around the world in August and September 2020, containing wildfires in several
locations. The dataset was split in two parts, and contains 10-band spectral
images with associated outputs, produced by three well known handcrafted
algorithms for active fire detection in the first part, and manually annotated
masks in the second part. We also present a study on how different
convolutional neural network architectures can be used to approximate these
handcrafted algorithms, and how models trained on automatically segmented
patches can be combined to achieve better performance than the original
algorithms - with the best combination having 87.2% precision and 92.4% recall
on our manually annotated dataset. The proposed dataset, source codes and
trained models are available on Github
(https://github.com/pereira-gha/activefire), creating opportunities for further
advances in the field</span>

                                        <span>This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative
procedures, such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions
from the standard classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group
fairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected
groups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry
historical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground
truth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a
single group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or
further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in
them is an impossible dilemma and being &quot;fair&quot; with respect to Asians may
require being &quot;unfair&quot; with respect to South Asians. This motivates the
introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the
relevant groupings.

We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their
incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of
demographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible}
to achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we
introduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously
through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results
and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models.</span>

                                        <span>The ability to estimate how a tumor might evolve in the future could have
tremendous clinical benefits, from improved treatment decisions to better dose
distribution in radiation therapy. Recent work has approached the glioma growth
modeling problem via deep learning and variational inference, thus learning
growth dynamics entirely from a real patient data distribution. So far, this
approach was constrained to predefined image acquisition intervals and
sequences of fixed length, which limits its applicability in more realistic
scenarios. We overcome these limitations by extending Neural Processes, a class
of conditional generative models for stochastic time series, with a
hierarchical multi-scale representation encoding including a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. The result is a learned growth model that can be
conditioned on an arbitrary number of observations, and that can produce a
distribution of temporally consistent growth trajectories on a continuous time
axis. On a dataset of 379 patients, the approach successfully captures both
global and finer-grained variations in the images, exhibiting superior
performance compared to other learned growth models.</span>

                                        <span>Road-boundary detection is important for autonomous driving. It can be used
to constrain autonomous vehicles running on road areas to ensure driving
safety. Compared with online road-boundary detection using on-vehicle
cameras/Lidars, offline detection using aerial images could alleviate the
severe occlusion issue. Moreover, the offline detection results can be directly
employed to annotate high-definition (HD) maps. In recent years, deep-learning
technologies have been used in offline detection. But there still lacks a
publicly available dataset for this task, which hinders the research progress
in this area. So in this paper, we propose a new benchmark dataset, named
\textit{Topo-boundary}, for offline topological road-boundary detection. The
dataset contains 25,295 $1000\times1000$-sized 4-channel aerial images. Each
image is provided with 8 training labels for different sub-tasks. We also
design a new entropy-based metric for connectivity evaluation, which could
better handle noises or outliers. We implement and evaluate 3
segmentation-based baselines and 5 graph-based baselines using the dataset. We
also propose a new imitation-learning-based baseline which is enhanced from our
previous work. The superiority of our enhancement is demonstrated from the
comparison. The dataset and our-implemented code for the baselines are
available at \texttt{\url{https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/Topo-boundary/}}.</span>

                                        <span>3D hand shape and pose estimation from a single depth map is a new and
challenging computer vision problem with many applications. Existing methods
addressing it directly regress hand meshes via 2D convolutional neural
networks, which leads to artifacts due to perspective distortions in the
images. To address the limitations of the existing methods, we develop
HandVoxNet++, i.e., a voxel-based deep network with 3D and graph convolutions
trained in a fully supervised manner. The input to our network is a 3D
voxelized-depth-map-based on the truncated signed distance function (TSDF).
HandVoxNet++ relies on two hand shape representations. The first one is the 3D
voxelized grid of hand shape, which does not preserve the mesh topology and
which is the most accurate representation. The second representation is the
hand surface that preserves the mesh topology. We combine the advantages of
both representations by aligning the hand surface to the voxelized hand shape
either with a new neural Graph-Convolutions-based Mesh Registration
(GCN-MeshReg) or classical segment-wise Non-Rigid Gravitational Approach
(NRGA++) which does not rely on training data. In extensive evaluations on
three public benchmarks, i.e., SynHand5M, depth-based HANDS19 challenge and
HO-3D, the proposed HandVoxNet++ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In
this journal extension of our previous approach presented at CVPR 2020, we gain
41.09% and 13.7% higher shape alignment accuracy on SynHand5M and HANDS19
datasets, respectively. Our method is ranked first on the HANDS19 challenge
dataset (Task 1: Depth-Based 3D Hand Pose Estimation) at the moment of the
submission of our results to the portal in August 2020.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.</span>

plant biodiversity research. This, however, is currently still being done
manually by botanists in the field. This work is very laborious, and the data
obtained is, though following a standardized method to estimate plant coverage,
usually subjective and has a coarse temporal resolution. To remedy these
caveats, we investigate approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to automatically extract the relevant data from images, focusing on plant
community composition and species coverages of 9 herbaceous plant species. To
this end, we investigate several standard CNN architectures and different
pretraining methods. We find that we outperform our previous approach at higher
image resolutions using a custom CNN with a mean absolute error of 5.16%. In
addition to these investigations, we also conduct an error analysis based on
the temporal aspect of the plant cover images. This analysis gives insight into
where problems for automatic approaches lie, like occlusion and likely
misclassifications caused by temporal changes.</span>

in this work. Recently, generative adversarial learning has significantly
advanced the image outpainting by producing semantic consistent content for the
given image. However, the existing methods always suffer from the blurry
texture and the artifacts of the generative part, making the overall
outpainting results lack authenticity. To overcome the weakness, this work
investigates a principle way to synthesize texture-rich results by borrowing
pixels from its neighbors (\ie, reference images), named
\textbf{Re}ference-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{O}utpainting (ReGO). Particularly,
the ReGO designs an Adaptive Content Selection (ACS) module to transfer the
pixel of reference images for texture compensating of the target one. To
prevent the style of the generated part from being affected by the reference
images, a style ranking loss is further proposed to augment the ReGO to
synthesize style-consistent results. Extensive experiments on two popular
benchmarks, NS6K~\cite{yangzx} and NS8K~\cite{wang}, well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our ReGO.</span>

non-stationary data stream without catastrophic forgetting. Recently, multiple
methods have been devised for incrementally learning classes on large-scale
image classification tasks, such as ImageNet. State-of-the-art continual
learning methods use an initial supervised pre-training phase, in which the
first 10% - 50% of the classes in a dataset are used to learn representations
in an offline manner before continual learning of new classes begins. We
hypothesize that self-supervised pre-training could yield features that
generalize better than supervised learning, especially when the number of
samples used for pre-training is small. We test this hypothesis using the
self-supervised MoCo-V2, Barlow Twins, and SwAV algorithms. On ImageNet, we
find that these methods outperform supervised pre-training considerably for
online continual learning, and the gains are larger when fewer samples are
available. Our findings are consistent across three online continual learning
algorithms. Our best system achieves a 14.95% relative increase in top-1
accuracy on class incremental ImageNet over the prior state of the art for
online continual learning.</span>

(COVID-19) patients. This two-center, retrospective study analyzed 530
deidentified CXRs from 515 COVID-19 patients treated at Stony Brook University
Hospital and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center between March and August 2020.
DL and machine learning classifiers to predict mechanical ventilation
requirement and mortality were trained and evaluated using patient CXRs. A
novel radiomic embedding framework was also explored for outcome prediction.
All results are compared against radiologist grading of CXRs (zone-wise expert
severity scores). Radiomic and DL classification models had mAUCs of
0.78+/-0.02 and 0.81+/-0.04, compared with expert scores mAUCs of 0.75+/-0.02
and 0.79+/-0.05 for mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality
prediction, respectively. Combined classifiers using both radiomics and expert
severity scores resulted in mAUCs of 0.79+/-0.04 and 0.83+/-0.04 for each
prediction task, demonstrating improvement over either artificial intelligence
or radiologist interpretation alone. Our results also suggest instances where
inclusion of radiomic features in DL improves model predictions, something that

outliers due to wrong data association, or to incorrect detections from signal
processing and machine learning methods. This paper introduces two unifying
formulations for outlier-robust estimation, Generalized Maximum Consensus
(G-MC) and Generalized Truncated Least Squares (G-TLS), and investigates
fundamental limits, practical algorithms, and applications. Our first
contribution is a proof that outlier-robust estimation is inapproximable: in
the worst case, it is impossible to (even approximately) find the set of
outliers, even with slower-than-polynomial-time algorithms (particularly,
algorithms running in quasi-polynomial time). As a second contribution, we
review and extend two general-purpose algorithms. The first, Adaptive Trimming
(ADAPT), is combinatorial, and is suitable for G-MC; the second, Graduated
Non-Convexity (GNC), is based on homotopy methods, and is suitable for G-TLS.
We extend ADAPT and GNC to the case where the user does not have prior
knowledge of the inlier-noise statistics (or the statistics may vary over time)
and is unable to guess a reasonable threshold to separate inliers from outliers
(as the one commonly used in RANSAC). We propose the first minimally tuned
algorithms for outlier rejection, that dynamically decide how to separate
inliers from outliers. Our third contribution is an evaluation of the proposed
algorithms on robot perception problems: mesh registration, image-based object
detection (shape alignment), and pose graph optimization. ADAPT and GNC execute
in real-time, are deterministic, outperform RANSAC, and are robust up to 80-90%
outliers. Their minimally tuned versions also compare favorably with the state
of the art, even though they do not rely on a noise bound for the inliers.</span>

mature in the full reference (FR) case, while the burgeoning no reference (NR)
case remains challenging. We investigate variants of the popular VMAF video
quality assessment algorithm for the FR case, using support vector regression
and feedforward neural networks, and extend it to the NR case, using the same
learning architectures, to develop a partially unified framework for VQA. When
heavily trained, algorithms such as VMAF perform well on test datasets, with
90%+ match; but predicting performance in the wild is better done by
training/testing from scratch, as we do. Even from scratch, we achieve 90%+
performance in FR, with gains over VMAF. And we greatly reduce complexity vs.
leading recent NR algorithms, VIDEVAL, RAPIQUE, yet exceed 80% in SRCC. In our
preliminary testing, we find the improvements in trainability, while also
constraining computational complexity, as quite encouraging, suggesting further
study and analysis.</span>

                                        <span>3D point cloud classification has many safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robotic grasping. However, several studies showed that
it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a
classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully
modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized
smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image
classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized
smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points.

In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable
robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted
points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud
classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each
of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud;
then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the
majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the
point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we
show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the
number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our
second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our
derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made.
Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness
guarantees. We also empirically evaluate PointGuard on ModelNet40 and ScanNet
benchmark datasets.</span>

detection. This benchmark is used for the Image Similarity Challenge at
NeurIPS&#x27;21 (ISC2021). The goal is to determine whether a query image is a
modified copy of any image in a reference corpus of size 1~million. The
benchmark features a variety of image transformations such as automated
transformations, hand-crafted image edits and machine-learning based
manipulations. This mimics real-life cases appearing in social media, for
example for integrity-related problems dealing with misinformation and
objectionable content. The strength of the image manipulations, and therefore
the difficulty of the benchmark, is calibrated according to the performance of
a set of baseline approaches. Both the query and reference set contain a
majority of &quot;distractor&quot; images that do not match, which corresponds to a
real-life needle-in-haystack setting, and the evaluation metric reflects that.
We expect the DISC21 benchmark to promote image copy detection as an important
and challenging computer vision task and refresh the state of the art.</span>

visual block containing a pretrained 2D-CNN followed by a temporal
convolutional network (TCN); (2) an aural block containing several parallel
TCNs; and (3) a leader-follower attentive fusion block combining the
audio-visual information. The TCN with large history coverage enables our model
to exploit spatial-temporal information within a much larger window length
(i.e., 300) than that from the baseline and state-of-the-art methods (i.e., 36

noisy aural modality using the inter-modality attention mechanism. To make full
use of the data and alleviate over-fitting, cross-validation is carried out on
the training and validation set. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)
centering is used to merge the results from each fold. On the development set,
the achieved CCC is 0.410 for valence and 0.661 for arousal, which
significantly outperforms the baseline method with the corresponding CCC of

(AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A
brief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is
provided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to
how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,
iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information
extraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the
successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these
areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and
its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near
future, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or
collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the
successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is
the &#x60;creator&#x27;, remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win
awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also
limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the
context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where
its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than
replace, human creativity.</span>

unknown future, which would assist the decision-making process of both humans
and agents. To meet this challenge, we present a new task named Visual
Relationship Forecasting (VRF) in videos to explore the prediction of visual
relationships in a reasoning manner. Specifically, given a subject-object pair
with H existing frames, VRF aims to predict their future interactions for the
next T frames without visual evidence. To evaluate the VRF task, we introduce
two video datasets named VRF-AG and VRF-VidOR, with a series of
spatio-temporally localized visual relation annotations in a video. These two
datasets densely annotate 13 and 35 visual relationships in 1923 and 13447
video clips, respectively. In addition, we present a novel Graph Convolutional
Transformer (GCT) framework, which captures both object-level and frame-level
dependencies by spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Network and Transformer.
Experimental results on both VRF-AG and VRF-VidOR datasets demonstrate that GCT
outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence modelling methods on visual
relationship forecasting.</span>

contrastive learning and contribute a structured collection of hand images,

greatly depends on its loss function. However, no loss function is perfect, and
it deals only with some aspects of an optimal similarity embedding. Besides,
the generalizability of the DML on unseen categories during the test stage is
an important matter that is not considered by existing loss functions. To
address these challenges, we propose novel approaches to combine different
losses built on top of a shared deep feature extractor. The proposed ensemble
of losses enforces the deep model to extract features that are consistent with
all losses. Since the selected losses are diverse and each emphasizes different
aspects of an optimal semantic embedding, our effective combining methods yield
a considerable improvement over any individual loss and generalize well on
unseen categories. Here, there is no limitation in choosing loss functions, and
our methods can work with any set of existing ones. Besides, they can optimize
each loss function as well as its weight in an end-to-end paradigm with no need
to adjust any hyper-parameter. We evaluate our methods on some popular datasets
from the machine vision domain in conventional Zero-Shot-Learning (ZSL)
settings. The results are very encouraging and show that our methods outperform
all baseline losses by a large margin in all datasets.</span>

seen a resurgence in deep models. In this paper, we find that existing
contrastive learning based solutions for self-supervised video recognition
focus on inter-variance encoding but ignore the intra-variance existing in
clips within the same video. We thus propose to learn dual representations for
each clip which (\romannumeral 1) encode intra-variance through a shuffle-rank
pretext task; (\romannumeral 2) encode inter-variance through a temporal
coherent contrastive loss. Experiment results show that our method plays an
essential role in balancing inter and intra variances and brings consistent
performance gains on multiple backbones and contrastive learning frameworks.
Integrated with SimCLR and pretrained on Kinetics-400, our method achieves
$\textbf{82.0\%}$ and $\textbf{51.2\%}$ downstream classification accuracy on
UCF101 and HMDB51 test sets respectively and $\textbf{46.1\%}$ video retrieval

agents in complex scenes. Whether it is internal personality factors of agents,
interactive behavior of the neighborhood, or the influence of surroundings, it
will have an impact on their future behavior styles. It means that even for the
same physical type of agents, there are huge differences in their behavior
preferences. Although recent works have made significant progress in studying
agents&#x27; multi-modal plannings, most of them still apply the same prediction
strategy to all agents, which makes them difficult to fully show the multiple
styles of vast agents. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Style Network (MSN)
to focus on this problem by divide agents&#x27; preference styles into several
hidden behavior categories adaptively and train each category&#x27;s prediction
network separately, therefore giving agents all styles of predictions
simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our deterministic MSN-D and

                                        <span>The deep image prior has demonstrated the remarkable ability that untrained
networks can address inverse imaging problems, such as denoising, inpainting
and super-resolution, by optimizing on just a single degraded image. Despite
its promise, it suffers from two limitations. First, it remains unclear how one
can control the prior beyond the choice of the network architecture. Second, it
requires an oracle to determine when to stop the optimization as the
performance degrades after reaching a peak. In this paper, we study the deep
image prior from a spectral bias perspective to address these problems. By
introducing a frequency-band correspondence measure, we observe that deep image
priors for inverse imaging exhibit a spectral bias during optimization, where
low-frequency image signals are learned faster and better than high-frequency
noise signals. This pinpoints why degraded images can be denoised or inpainted
when the optimization is stopped at the right time. Based on our observations,
we propose to control the spectral bias in the deep image prior to prevent
performance degradation and to speed up optimization convergence. We do so in
the two core layer types of inverse imaging networks: the convolution layer and
the upsampling layer. We present a Lipschitz-controlled approach for the
convolution and a Gaussian-controlled approach for the upsampling layer. We
further introduce a stopping criterion to avoid superfluous computation. The
experiments on denoising, inpainting and super-resolution show that our method
no longer suffers from performance degradation during optimization, relieving
us from the need for an oracle criterion to stop early. We further outline a
stopping criterion to avoid superfluous computation. Finally, we show that our
approach obtains favorable restoration results compared to current approaches,
across all tasks.</span>

tremendously successful in recent years. However, these contrastive schemes are
notoriously resource demanding, as their effectiveness breaks down with
small-batch training (i.e., the log-K curse, whereas K is the batch-size). In
this work, we reveal mathematically why contrastive learners fail in the
small-batch-size regime, and present a novel simple, non-trivial contrastive
objective named FlatNCE, which fixes this issue. Unlike InfoNCE, our FlatNCE no
longer explicitly appeals to a discriminative classification goal for
contrastive learning. Theoretically, we show FlatNCE is the mathematical dual
formulation of InfoNCE, thus bridging the classical literature on energy
modeling; and empirically, we demonstrate that, with minimal modification of
code, FlatNCE enables immediate performance boost independent of the
subject-matter engineering efforts. The significance of this work is furthered
by the powerful generalization of contrastive learning techniques, and the
introduction of new tools to monitor and diagnose contrastive training. We
substantiate our claims with empirical evidence on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and other
datasets, where FlatNCE consistently outperforms InfoNCE.</span>

approach for assessment of infant neurophysiological development, and where
efficient signal analysis plays a central role. This study investigates the use
of different end-to-end neural network architectures for processing infant
motility data from wearable sensors. We focus on the performance and
computational burden of alternative sensor encoder and time-series modelling
modules and their combinations. In addition, we explore the benefits of data
augmentation methods in ideal and non-ideal recording conditions. The
experiments are conducted using a data-set of multi-sensor movement recordings
from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for
infant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder
module has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the
best performance was obtained with parallel 2-dimensional convolutions for
intra-sensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results
also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable
for within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier
performance. Comparison of time-series models revealed that feed-forward
dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all
RNN-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The
experiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in
simulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and
sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to
performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance. Overall the
results provide tangible suggestions on how to optimize end-to-end neural
network training for multi-channel movement sensor data.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we address the problem of cross-view geo-localization, which
estimates the geospatial location of a street view image by matching it with a
database of geo-tagged aerial images. The cross-view matching task is extremely
challenging due to drastic appearance and geometry differences across views.
Unlike existing methods that predominantly fall back on CNN, here we devise a
novel evolving geo-localization Transformer (EgoTR) that utilizes the
properties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus
significantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization. We
also exploit the positional encoding of Transformer to help the EgoTR
understand and correspond geometric configurations between ground and aerial
images. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that impose strong assumption on
geometry knowledge, the EgoTR flexibly learns the positional embeddings through
the training objective and hence becomes more practical in many real-world
scenarios. Although Transformer is well suited to our task, its vanilla
self-attention mechanism independently interacts within image patches in each
layer, which overlooks correlations between layers. Instead, this paper propose
a simple yet effective self-cross attention mechanism to improve the quality of
learned representations. The self-cross attention models global dependencies
between adjacent layers, which relates between image patches while modeling how
features evolve in the previous layer. As a result, the proposed self-cross
attention leads to more stable training, improves the generalization ability
and encourages representations to keep evolving as the network goes deeper.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EgoTR performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods on standard, fine-grained and cross-dataset cross-view
geo-localization tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Intestinal parasitic infection leads to several morbidities to humans
worldwide, especially in tropical countries. The traditional diagnosis usually
relies on manual analysis from microscopic images which is prone to human error
due to morphological similarity of different parasitic eggs and abundance of
impurities in a sample. Many studies have developed automatic systems for
parasite egg detection to reduce human workload. However, they work with high
quality microscopes, which unfortunately remain unaffordable in some rural
areas. Our work thus exploits a benefit of a low-cost USB microscope. This
instrument however provides poor quality of images due to limitation of
magnification (10x), causing difficulty in parasite detection and species
classification. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based technique using transfer
learning strategy to enhance the efficiency of automatic parasite
classification in poor-quality microscopic images. The patch-based technique
with sliding window is employed to search for location of the eggs. Two
networks, AlexNet and ResNet50, are examined with a trade-off between
architecture size and classification performance. The results show that our
proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art object recognition methods.
Our system combined with final decision from an expert may improve the real
faecal examination with low-cost microscopes.</span>

                                        <span>As a fundamental problem for Artificial Intelligence, multi-agent system
(MAS) is making rapid progress, mainly driven by multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) techniques. However, previous MARL methods largely focused on
grid-world like or game environments; MAS in visually rich environments has
remained less explored. To narrow this gap and emphasize the crucial role of
perception in MAS, we propose a large-scale 3D dataset, CollaVN, for
multi-agent visual navigation (MAVN). In CollaVN, multiple agents are entailed
to cooperatively navigate across photo-realistic environments to reach target
locations. Diverse MAVN variants are explored to make our problem more general.
Moreover, a memory-augmented communication framework is proposed. Each agent is
equipped with a private, external memory to persistently store communication
information. This allows agents to make better use of their past communication
information, enabling more efficient collaboration and robust long-term
planning. In our experiments, several baselines and evaluation metrics are
designed. We also empirically verify the efficacy of our proposed MARL approach
across different MAVN task settings.</span>

the same time, it has created a gap due to widespread inability of non-Braille
users to understand Braille scripts. This gap has fuelled researchers to
propose Optical Braille Recognition techniques to convert Braille documents to
natural language. The main motivation of this work is to cement the
communication gap at academic institutions by translating personal documents of
blind students. This has been accomplished by proposing an economical and
effective technique which digitizes Braille documents using a smartphone
camera. For any given Braille image, a dot detection mechanism based on Hough
transform is proposed which is invariant to skewness, noise and other
deterrents. The detected dots are then clustered into Braille cells using
distance-based clustering algorithm. In succession, the standard physical
parameters of each Braille cells are estimated for feature extraction and
classification as natural language characters. The comprehensive evaluation of
this technique on the proposed dataset of 54 Braille scripts has yielded into
accuracy of 98.71%.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based segmentation methods are vulnerable to unforeseen data
distribution shifts during deployment, e.g. change of image appearances or
contrasts caused by different scanners, unexpected imaging artifacts etc. In
this paper, we present a cooperative framework for training image segmentation
models and a latent space augmentation method for generating hard examples.
Both contributions improve model generalization and robustness with limited
data. The cooperative training framework consists of a fast-thinking network
(FTN) and a slow-thinking network (STN). The FTN learns decoupled image
features and shape features for image reconstruction and segmentation tasks.
The STN learns shape priors for segmentation correction and refinement. The two
networks are trained in a cooperative manner. The latent space augmentation
generates challenging examples for training by masking the decoupled latent
space in both channel-wise and spatial-wise manners. We performed extensive
experiments on public cardiac imaging datasets. Using only 10 subjects from a
single site for training, we demonstrated improved cross-site segmentation
performance and increased robustness against various unforeseen imaging
artifacts compared to strong baseline methods. Particularly, cooperative
training with latent space data augmentation yields 15% improvement in terms of
average Dice score when compared to a standard training method.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce WiCluster, a new machine learning (ML) approach for passive
indoor positioning using radio frequency (RF) channel state information (CSI).
WiCluster can predict both a zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D
position, without using any precise position labels during training. Prior
CSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric approaches using
digital signal-processing (DSP) and, more recently, parametric approaches
(e.g., fully supervised ML methods). However these do not handle the complexity
of real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for large-scale
commercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based method deteriorates
significantly in non-line-of-sight conditions, while supervised ML methods need
large amounts of hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In
contrast, WiCluster is both precise and requires weaker label-information that
can be easily collected. Our first contribution is a novel dimensionality
reduction method for charting. It combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale
clustering-loss to map the high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D
latent space. Our second contribution is two weakly supervised losses that map
this latent space into a Cartesian map, resulting in meter-accuracy position
results. These losses only require simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the
floorplan, approximate location of access-point locations and a few CSI packets
that are labeled with the corresponding zone in the floorplan. Thirdly, we
report results and a robustness study for 2D positioning in a single-floor
office building and 3D positioning in a two-floor home to show the robustness
of our method.</span>

implant leading to vision deterioration and eye trauma. In order to reduce the
risk of this complication, it is vital to discover the risk factors during the
surgery. However, studying the relationship between lens dislocation and its
suspicious risk factors using numerous videos is a time-extensive procedure.
Hence, the surgeons demand an automatic approach to enable a larger-scale and,
accordingly, more reliable study. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
as the major step towards lens irregularity detection. In particular, we
propose (I) an end-to-end recurrent neural network to recognize the
lens-implantation phase and (II) a novel semantic segmentation network to
segment the lens and pupil after the implantation phase. The phase recognition
results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed surgical phase recognition
approach. Moreover, the segmentation results confirm the proposed segmentation

                                        <span>While the researches on single image super-resolution (SISR), especially
equipped with deep neural networks (DNNs), have achieved tremendous successes
recently, they still suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, the real image
degradation is usually unknown and highly variant from one to another, making
it extremely hard to train a single model to handle the general SISR task.
Secondly, most of current methods mainly focus on the downsampling process of
the degradation, but ignore or underestimate the inevitable noise
contamination. For example, the commonly-used independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise distribution always largely deviates from
the real image noise (e.g., camera sensor noise), which limits their
performance in real scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
model-based unsupervised SISR method to deal with the general SISR task with
unknown degradations. Instead of the traditional i.i.d. Gaussian noise
assumption, a novel patch-based non-i.i.d. noise modeling method is proposed to
fit the complex real noise. Besides, a deep generator parameterized by a DNN is
used to map the latent variable to the high-resolution image, and the
conventional hyper-Laplacian prior is also elaborately embedded into such
generator to further constrain the image gradients. Finally, a Monte Carlo EM
algorithm is designed to solve our model, which provides a general inference
framework to update the image generator both w.r.t. the latent variable and the
network parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can evidently surpass the current state of the art (SotA) method (about
1dB PSNR) not only with a slighter model (0.34M vs. 2.40M) but also faster
speed.</span>

                                        <span>Cardiac ultrasound imaging is used to diagnose various heart diseases. Common
analysis pipelines involve manual processing of the video frames by expert
clinicians. This suffers from intra- and inter-observer variability. We propose
a novel approach to ultrasound video analysis using a transformer architecture
based on a Residual Auto-Encoder Network and a BERT model adapted for token
classification. This enables videos of any length to be processed. We apply our
model to the task of End-Systolic (ES) and End-Diastolic (ED) frame detection
and the automated computation of the left ventricular ejection fraction. We
achieve an average frame distance of 3.36 frames for the ES and 7.17 frames for
the ED on videos of arbitrary length. Our end-to-end learnable approach can
estimate the ejection fraction with a MAE of 5.95 and $R^2$ of 0.52 in 0.15s
per video, showing that segmentation is not the only way to predict ejection
fraction. Code and models are available at https://github.com/HReynaud/UVT.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the success of recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods on
various tasks which have shown to output networks that largely outperform
human-designed networks, conventional NAS methods have mostly tackled the
optimization of searching for the network architecture for a single task
(dataset), which does not generalize well across multiple tasks (datasets).
Moreover, since such task-specific methods search for a neural architecture
from scratch for every given task, they incur a large computational cost, which
is problematic when the time and monetary budget are limited. In this paper, we
propose an efficient NAS framework that is trained once on a database
consisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search for a
neural architecture for a novel dataset. The proposed MetaD2A (Meta
Dataset-to-Architecture) model can stochastically generate graphs
(architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a cross-modal latent space
learned with amortized meta-learning. Moreover, we also propose a
meta-performance predictor to estimate and select the best architecture without
direct training on target datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that
our model meta-learned on subsets of ImageNet-1K and architectures from
NAS-Bench 201 search space successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets
including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with an average search time of 33 GPU
seconds. Even under MobileNetV3 search space, MetaD2A is 5.5K times faster than
NSGANetV2, a transferable NAS method, with comparable performance. We believe
that the MetaD2A proposes a new research direction for rapid NAS as well as
ways to utilize the knowledge from rich databases of datasets and architectures
accumulated over the past years. Code is available at

                                        <span>Weak supervision learning on classification labels has demonstrated high
performance in various tasks. When a few pixel-level fine annotations are also
affordable, it is natural to leverage both of the pixel-level (e.g.,
segmentation) and image level (e.g., classification) annotation to further
improve the performance. In computational pathology, however, such weak or
mixed supervision learning is still a challenging task, since the high
resolution of whole slide images makes it unattainable to perform end-to-end
training of classification models. An alternative approach is to analyze such
data by patch-base model training, i.e., using self-supervised learning to
generate pixel-level pseudo labels for patches. However, such methods usually
have model drifting issues, i.e., hard to converge, because the noise
accumulates during the self-training process. To handle those problems, we
propose a mixed supervision learning framework for super high-resolution images
to effectively utilize their various labels (e.g., sufficient image-level
coarse annotations and a few pixel-level fine labels). During the patch
training stage, this framework can make use of coarse image-level labels to
refine self-supervised learning and generate high-quality pixel-level pseudo
labels. A comprehensive strategy is proposed to suppress pixel-level false
positives and false negatives. Three real-world datasets with very large number
of images (i.e., more than 10,000 whole slide images) and various types of
labels are used to evaluate the effectiveness of mixed supervision learning. We
reduced the false positive rate by around one third compared to state of the
art while retaining 100\% sensitivity, in the task of image-level
classification.</span>

                                        <span>The classification of histopathological images is of great value in both
cancer diagnosis and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons, such as
variations caused by magnification factors and class imbalance, make it a
challenging task where conventional methods that learn from image-label
datasets perform unsatisfactorily in many cases. We observe that tumours of the
same class often share common morphological patterns. To exploit this fact, we
propose an approach that learns similarity-based multi-scale embeddings (SMSE)
for magnification-independent histopathological image classification. In
particular, a pair loss and a triplet loss are leveraged to learn
similarity-based embeddings from image pairs or image triplets. The learned
embeddings provide accurate measurements of similarities between images, which
are regarded as a more effective form of representation for histopathological
morphology than normal image features. Furthermore, in order to ensure the
generated models are magnification-independent, images acquired at different
magnification factors are simultaneously fed to networks during training for
learning multi-scale embeddings. In addition to the SMSE, to eliminate the
impact of class imbalance, instead of using the hard sample mining strategy
that intuitively discards some easy samples, we introduce a new reinforced
focal loss to simultaneously punish hard misclassified samples while
suppressing easy well-classified samples. Experimental results show that the
SMSE improves the performance for histopathological image classification tasks
for both breast and liver cancers by a large margin compared to previous
methods. In particular, the SMSE achieves the best performance on the BreakHis
benchmark with an improvement ranging from 5% to 18% compared to previous
methods using traditional features.</span>

delusional psychosis, often with destructive consequences for those affected
and their surroundings. Early detection and intervention of a manic episode are
crucial to prevent escalation, hospital admission and premature death. However,
people with bipolar disorder may not recognize that they are experiencing a
manic episode and symptoms such as euphoria and increased productivity can also
deter affected individuals from seeking help. This work proposes to perform
user-independent, automatic mood-state detection based on actigraphy and
electrodermal activity acquired from a wrist-worn device during mania and after
recovery (euthymia). This paper proposes a new deep learning-based ensemble
method leveraging long (20h) and short (5 minutes) time-intervals to
discriminate between the mood-states. When tested on 47 bipolar patients, the
proposed classification scheme achieves an average accuracy of 91.59% in
euthymic/manic mood-state recognition.</span>

                                        <span>Currently, domestic service robots have an insufficient ability to interact
naturally through language. This is because understanding human instructions is
complicated by various ambiguities and missing information. In existing
methods, the referring expressions that specify the relationships between
objects are insufficiently modeled. In this paper, we propose Target-dependent
UNITER, which learns the relationship between the target object and other
objects directly by focusing on the relevant regions within an image, rather
than the whole image. Our method is an extension of the UNITER-based
Transformer that can be pretrained on general-purpose datasets. We extend the
UNITER approach by introducing a new architecture for handling the target
candidates. Our model is validated on two standard datasets, and the results
show that Target-dependent UNITER outperforms the baseline method in terms of
classification accuracy.</span>

illumination manipulation, which creates a local image translation between two
illumination surfaces. This model is built on an optimization-based framework
consisting of three photo-realistic losses defined on the sub-layers factorized
by an intrinsic image decomposition. We illustrate that all losses can be
reduced without the necessity of taking an intrinsic image decomposition under
the well-known spatial-varying illumination illumination-invariant reflectance
prior knowledge. Moreover, with a series of relaxations, all of them can be
directly defined on images, giving a closed-form solution for image
illumination manipulation. This new paradigm differs from the prevailing
Retinex-based algorithms, as it provides an implicit way to deal with the
per-pixel image illumination. We finally demonstrate its versatility and
benefits to the illumination-related tasks such as illumination compensation,
image enhancement, and high dynamic range (HDR) image compression, and show the
high-quality results on natural image datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Hierarchical classification is significant for complex tasks by providing
multi-granular predictions and encouraging better mistakes. As the label
structure decides its performance, many existing approaches attempt to
construct an excellent label structure for promoting the classification
results. In this paper, we consider that different label structures provide a
variety of prior knowledge for category recognition, thus fusing them is
helpful to achieve better hierarchical classification results. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-task multi-structure fusion model to integrate different label
structures. It contains two kinds of branches: one is the traditional
classification branch to classify the common subclasses, the other is
responsible for identifying the heterogeneous superclasses defined by different
label structures. Besides the effect of multiple label structures, we also
explore the architecture of the deep model for better hierachical
classification and adjust the hierarchical evaluation metrics for multiple
label structures. Experimental results on CIFAR100 and Car196 show that our
method obtains significantly better results than using a flat classifier or a
hierarchical classifier with any single label structure.</span>

has been well explored. However, the wide variety of methods have not analyzed
the role of a classifier&#x27;s performance in detail. In this paper, we thoroughly
examine the role of a classifier in terms of matching source and target
distributions. We specifically investigate the classifier ability by matching
a) the distribution of features, b) probabilistic uncertainty for samples and
c) certainty activation mappings. Our analysis suggests that using these three
distributions does result in a consistently improved performance on all the
datasets. Our work thus extends present knowledge on the role of the various
distributions obtained from the classifier towards solving unsupervised domain

                                        <span>In real life, people communicate using both speech and non-verbal signals
such as gestures, face expression or body pose. Non-verbal signals impact the
meaning of the spoken utterance in an abundance of ways. An absence of
non-verbal signals impoverishes the process of communication. Yet, when users
are represented as avatars, it is difficult to translate non-verbal signals
along with the speech into the virtual world without specialized motion-capture
hardware. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven technique for
generating gestures directly from speech. Our approach is based on the
application of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to model the
correlation rather than causation between speech and gestures. This approach
approximates neuroscience findings on how non-verbal communication and speech
are correlated. We create a large dataset which consists of speech and
corresponding gestures in a 3D human pose format from which our model learns
the speaker-specific correlation. We evaluate the proposed technique in a user
study that is inspired by the Turing test. For the study, we animate the
generated gestures on a virtual character. We find that users are not able to
distinguish between the generated and the recorded gestures. Moreover, users
are able to identify our synthesized gestures as related or not related to a
given utterance.</span>

selecting the most informative samples. However, existing active learning
methods do not work well in realistic scenarios such as imbalance or rare
classes, out-of-distribution data in the unlabeled set, and redundancy. In this
work, we propose SIMILAR (Submodular Information Measures based actIve

submodular information measures (SIM) as acquisition functions. We argue that
SIMILAR not only works in standard active learning, but also easily extends to
the realistic settings considered above and acts as a one-stop solution for
active learning that is scalable to large real-world datasets. Empirically, we
show that SIMILAR significantly outperforms existing active learning algorithms
by as much as ~5% - 18% in the case of rare classes and ~5% - 10% in the case
of out-of-distribution data on several image classification tasks like

                                        <span>Semantic segmentation is one of the basic, yet essential scene understanding
tasks for an autonomous agent. The recent developments in supervised machine
learning and neural networks have enjoyed great success in enhancing the
performance of the state-of-the-art techniques for this task. However, their
superior performance is highly reliant on the availability of a large-scale
annotated dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel fully unsupervised
semantic segmentation method, the so-called Information Maximization and
Adversarial Regularization Segmentation (InMARS). Inspired by human perception
which parses a scene into perceptual groups, rather than analyzing each pixel
individually, our proposed approach first partitions an input image into
meaningful regions (also known as superpixels). Next, it utilizes
Mutual-Information-Maximization followed by an adversarial training strategy to
cluster these regions into semantically meaningful classes. To customize an
adversarial training scheme for the problem, we incorporate adversarial pixel
noise along with spatial perturbations to impose photometrical and geometrical
invariance on the deep neural network. Our experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used
unsupervised semantic segmentation datasets, COCO-Stuff, and Potsdam.</span>

language processing tasks. However, its applications to medical vision remain
largely unexplored. In this study, we present UTNet, a simple yet powerful
hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a
convolutional neural network for enhancing medical image segmentation. UTNet
applies self-attention modules in both encoder and decoder for capturing
long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end,
we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position
encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly
from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also
proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the
encoder. Our approach addresses the dilemma that Transformer requires huge
amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows
the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of
pre-training. We have evaluated UTNet on the multi-label, multi-vendor cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging cohort. UTNet demonstrates superior segmentation
performance and robustness against the state-of-the-art approaches, holding the
promise to generalize well on other medical image segmentations.</span>

                                        <span>Pixel-wise regression is probably the most common problem in fine-grained
computer vision tasks, such as estimating keypoint heatmaps and segmentation
masks. These regression problems are very challenging particularly because they
require, at low computation overheads, modeling long-range dependencies on
high-resolution inputs/outputs to estimate the highly nonlinear pixel-wise
semantics. While attention mechanisms in Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks(DCNNs) has become popular for boosting long-range dependencies,
element-specific attention, such as Nonlocal blocks, is highly complex and
noise-sensitive to learn, and most of simplified attention hybrids try to reach
the best compromise among multiple types of tasks. In this paper, we present
the Polarized Self-Attention(PSA) block that incorporates two critical designs
towards high-quality pixel-wise regression: (1) Polarized filtering: keeping
high internal resolution in both channel and spatial attention computation
while completely collapsing input tensors along their counterpart dimensions.
(2) Enhancement: composing non-linearity that directly fits the output
distribution of typical fine-grained regression, such as the 2D Gaussian
distribution (keypoint heatmaps), or the 2D Binormial distribution (binary
segmentation masks). PSA appears to have exhausted the representation capacity
within its channel-only and spatial-only branches, such that there is only
marginal metric differences between its sequential and parallel layouts.
Experimental results show that PSA boosts standard baselines by $2-4$ points,
and boosts state-of-the-arts by $1-2$ points on 2D pose estimation and semantic
segmentation benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Image super-resolution (SR) research has witnessed impressive progress thanks
to the advance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recent years.
However, most existing SR methods are non-blind and assume that degradation has
a single fixed and known distribution (e.g., bicubic) which struggle while
handling degradation in real-world data that usually follows a multi-modal,
spatially variant, and unknown distribution. The recent blind SR studies
address this issue via degradation estimation, but they do not generalize well
to multi-source degradation and cannot handle spatially variant degradation. We
design CRL-SR, a contrastive representation learning network that focuses on
blind SR of images with multi-modal and spatially variant distributions. CRL-SR
addresses the blind SR challenges from two perspectives. The first is
contrastive decoupling encoding which introduces contrastive learning to
extract resolution-invariant embedding and discard resolution-variant embedding
under the guidance of a bidirectional contrastive loss. The second is
contrastive feature refinement which generates lost or corrupted high-frequency
details under the guidance of a conditional contrastive loss. Extensive
experiments on synthetic datasets and real images show that the proposed CRL-SR
can handle multi-modal and spatially variant degradation effectively under
blind settings and it also outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.</span>

segmentation. This setting presents several key challenges, including
processing and exchanging unregistered robotic swarm imagery. To be successful,
solutions must effectively leverage multiple non-static and
intermittently-overlapping RGB perspectives, while heeding bandwidth
constraints and overcoming unwanted foreground obstructions. As such, we
propose an end-to-end learn-able Multi-Agent Spatial Handshaking network (MASH)

Our distributed communication module operates directly (and exclusively) on raw

unmanned aircraft. The proposed system attempts label-to-label matching, not
image-to-image matching between aerial images and a map database. By using
semantic segmentation, the ground objects are labelled and the configuration of
the objects is used to find the corresponding location in the map database. The
use of the deep learning technique as a tool for extracting high-level features
reduces the image-based localization problem to a pattern matching problem.
This paper proposes a pattern matching algorithm which does not require
altitude information or a camera model to estimate the absolute horizontal
position. The feasibility analysis with simulated images shows the proposed
map-based navigation can be realized with the proposed pattern matching
algorithm and it is able to provide positions given the labelled objects.</span>

                                        <span>Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based
recommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of
interactions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the
user&#x27;s recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender
system mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions,
which are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency
relationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session
information due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between
different sessions is prevented. In this paper, we solve these problems with
the graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a
graph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full
Graph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency.
To exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual
session&#x27;s representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected
Session (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout
function to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive
experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e.,
Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art
session-based recommender models.</span>

                                        <span>For present e-commerce platforms, session-based recommender systems are
developed to predict users&#x27; preference for next-item recommendation. Although a
session can usually reflect a user&#x27;s current preference, a local shift of the
user&#x27;s intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the
interactions that take place in the early positions within a session generally
indicate the user&#x27;s initial intention, while later interactions are more likely
to represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely
considered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the
significance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the
positional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed
in this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We
formally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to
evaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial
and the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional
encoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent
the dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding
scheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)
is proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness. Based
on DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a
well-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit
the positional information for session-based recommendation tasks. Extensive
experiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, Yoochoose and
Diginetica and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by
comparing it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we consider how preference models in interactive recommendation
systems determine the availability of content and users&#x27; opportunities for
discovery. We propose an evaluation procedure based on stochastic reachability
to quantify the maximum probability of recommending a target piece of content
to an user for a set of allowable strategic modifications. This framework
allows us to compute an upper bound on the likelihood of recommendation with
minimal assumptions about user behavior. Stochastic reachability can be used to
detect biases in the availability of content and diagnose limitations in the
opportunities for discovery granted to users. We show that this metric can be
computed efficiently as a convex program for a variety of practical settings,
and further argue that reachability is not inherently at odds with accuracy. We
demonstrate evaluations of recommendation algorithms trained on large datasets
of explicit and implicit ratings. Our results illustrate how preference models,
selection rules, and user interventions impact reachability and how these
effects can be distributed unevenly.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for prediction
tasks on graphs. As pointed out by recent studies, most GNNs assume local
homophily, i.e., strong similarities in local neighborhoods. This assumption
however limits the generalizability power of GNNs. To address this limitation,
we propose a flexible GNN model, which is capable of handling any graphs
without being restricted by their underlying homophily. At its core, this model
adopts a node attention mechanism based on multiple learnable spectral filters;
therefore, the aggregation scheme is learned adaptively for each graph in the
spectral domain. We evaluated the proposed model on node classification tasks
over eight benchmark datasets. The proposed model is shown to generalize well
to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Further, it outperforms all
state-of-the-art baselines on heterophilic graphs and performs comparably with
them on homophilic graphs.</span>

                                        <span>Active fire detection in satellite imagery is of critical importance to the
management of environmental conservation policies, supporting decision-making
and law enforcement. This is a well established field, with many techniques
being proposed over the years, usually based on pixel or region-level
comparisons involving sensor-specific thresholds and neighborhood statistics.
In this paper, we address the problem of active fire detection using deep
learning techniques. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been
enjoying an enormous success in many fields, but their use for active fire
detection is relatively new, with open questions and demand for datasets and
architectures for evaluation. This paper addresses these issues by introducing
a new large-scale dataset for active fire detection, with over 150,000 image
patches (more than 200 GB of data) extracted from Landsat-8 images captured
around the world in August and September 2020, containing wildfires in several
locations. The dataset was split in two parts, and contains 10-band spectral
images with associated outputs, produced by three well known handcrafted
algorithms for active fire detection in the first part, and manually annotated
masks in the second part. We also present a study on how different
convolutional neural network architectures can be used to approximate these
handcrafted algorithms, and how models trained on automatically segmented
patches can be combined to achieve better performance than the original
algorithms - with the best combination having 87.2% precision and 92.4% recall
on our manually annotated dataset. The proposed dataset, source codes and
trained models are available on Github
(https://github.com/pereira-gha/activefire), creating opportunities for further
advances in the field</span>

requiring that they are formally learnable and instance robust. Learnability
ensures that predictions can be efficiently constructed from a reasonable
amount of past data. Instance robustness ensures that the prediction is robust
to modest changes in the problem input, where the measure of the change may be
problem specific. Instance robustness insists on a smooth degradation in
performance as a function of the change. Ideally, the performance is never
worse than worst-case bounds. This also allows predictions to be objectively
compared.

We design online algorithms with predictions for a network flow allocation
problem and restricted assignment makespan minimization. For both problems, two
key properties are established: high quality predictions can be learned from a
small sample of prior instances and these predictions are robust to errors that
smoothly degrade as the underlying problem instance changes.</span>

architectures in linear optics, supplemented by adaptive measurements. We then
challenge these quantum algorithms by deriving classical simulation algorithms

obtain different classical simulability regimes for these two computational

both cases, our results set explicit limits to the range of parameters for
which a quantum advantage can be envisaged with adaptive linear optics compared

                                        <span>3D point cloud classification has many safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robotic grasping. However, several studies showed that
it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a
classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully
modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized
smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image
classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized
smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points.

In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable
robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted
points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud
classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each
of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud;
then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the
majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the
point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we
show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the
number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our
second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our
derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made.
Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness
guarantees. We also empirically evaluate PointGuard on ModelNet40 and ScanNet
benchmark datasets.</span>

literature assume that data are a homogeneous set of observations; whereas it
is often the case that they comprise different related, but not homogeneous,
data sets collected in different ways. In this paper we propose a new Bayesian
Dirichlet score, which we call Bayesian Hierarchical Dirichlet (BHD). The
proposed score is based on a hierarchical model that pools information across
data sets to learn a single encompassing network structure, while taking into
account the differences in their probabilistic structures. We derive a
closed-form expression for BHD using a variational approximation of the
marginal likelihood and we study its performance using simulated data. We find
that, when data comprise multiple related data sets, BHD outperforms the
Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) score in terms of reconstruction
accuracy as measured by the Structural Hamming distance, and that it is as
accurate as BDeu when data are homogeneous. Moreover, the estimated networks
are sparser and therefore more interpretable than those obtained with BDeu,
thanks to a lower number of false positive arcs.</span>

finite-sum optimization. Our contribution is threefold: We first show that a
deterministic algorithm cannot profit from the finite-sum structure of the
objective, and that simulating a pth-order regularized method on the whole
function by constructing exact gradient information is optimal up to constant
factors. We further show lower bounds for randomized algorithms and compare
them with the best known upper bounds. To address some gaps between the bounds,
we propose a new second-order smoothness assumption that can be seen as an
analogue of the first-order mean-squared smoothness assumption. We prove that
it is sufficient to ensure state-of-the-art convergence guarantees, while
allowing for a sharper lower bound.</span>

                                        <span>A conventional subject-dependent (SD) brain-computer interface (BCI) requires
a complete data-gathering, training, and calibration phase for each user before
it can be used. In recent years, a number of subject-independent (SI) BCIs have
been developed. However, there are many problems preventing them from being
used in real-world BCI applications. A weaker performance compared to the
subject-dependent (SD) approach, and a relatively large model requiring high
computational power are the most important ones. Therefore, a potential
real-world BCI would greatly benefit from a compact low-power
subject-independent BCI framework, ready to be used immediately after the user
puts it on. To move towards this goal, we propose a novel subject-independent
BCI framework named CCSPNet (Convolutional Common Spatial Pattern Network)
trained on the motor imagery (MI) paradigm of a large-scale
electroencephalography (EEG) signals database consisting of 21600 trials for 54
subjects performing two-class hand-movement MI tasks. The proposed framework
applies a wavelet kernel convolutional neural network (WKCNN) and a temporal
convolutional neural network (TCNN) in order to represent and extract the
diverse spectral features of EEG signals. The outputs of the convolutional
layers go through a common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm for spatial feature
extraction. The number of CSP features is reduced by a dense neural network,
and the final class label is determined by a linear discriminative analysis
(LDA) classifier. The CCSPNet framework evaluation results show that it is
possible to have a low-power compact BCI that achieves both SD and SI
performance comparable to complex and computationally expensive.</span>

(AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A
brief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is
provided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to
how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,
iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information
extraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the
successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these
areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and
its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near
future, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or
collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the
successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is
the &#x60;creator&#x27;, remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win
awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also
limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the
context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where
its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than
replace, human creativity.</span>

                                        <span>A crucial ability of human intelligence is to build up models of individual
3D objects from partial scene observations. Recent works achieve object-centric
generation but without the ability to infer the representation, or achieve 3D
scene representation learning but without object-centric compositionality.
Therefore, learning to represent and render 3D scenes with object-centric
compositionality remains elusive. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
generative model for learning to build modular and compositional 3D object
models from partial observations of a multi-object scene. The proposed model
can (i) infer the 3D object representations by learning to search and group
object areas and also (ii) render from an arbitrary viewpoint not only
individual objects but also the full scene by compositing the objects. The
entire learning process is unsupervised and end-to-end. In experiments, in
addition to generation quality, we also demonstrate that the learned
representation permits object-wise manipulation and novel scene generation, and
generalizes to various settings. Results can be found on our project website:

computational modeling of chest radiographs (CXRs) for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) patients. This two-center, retrospective study analyzed 530
deidentified CXRs from 515 COVID-19 patients treated at Stony Brook University
Hospital and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center between March and August 2020.
DL and machine learning classifiers to predict mechanical ventilation
requirement and mortality were trained and evaluated using patient CXRs. A
novel radiomic embedding framework was also explored for outcome prediction.
All results are compared against radiologist grading of CXRs (zone-wise expert
severity scores). Radiomic and DL classification models had mAUCs of
0.78+/-0.02 and 0.81+/-0.04, compared with expert scores mAUCs of 0.75+/-0.02
and 0.79+/-0.05 for mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality
prediction, respectively. Combined classifiers using both radiomics and expert
severity scores resulted in mAUCs of 0.79+/-0.04 and 0.83+/-0.04 for each
prediction task, demonstrating improvement over either artificial intelligence
or radiologist interpretation alone. Our results also suggest instances where
inclusion of radiomic features in DL improves model predictions, something that
might be explored in other pathologies. The models proposed in this study and
the prognostic information they provide might aid physician decision making and
resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

in pattern recognition. Part of this success can be attributed to the reliance
on big data to increase generalization. However, in the field of time series
recognition, many datasets are often very small. One method of addressing this
problem is through the use of data augmentation. In this paper, we survey data
augmentation techniques for time series and their application to time series
classification with neural networks. We propose a taxonomy and outline the four
families in time series data augmentation, including transformation-based
methods, pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition methods.
Furthermore, we empirically evaluate 12 time series data augmentation methods
on 128 time series classification datasets with six different types of neural
networks. Through the results, we are able to analyze the characteristics,
advantages and disadvantages, and recommendations of each data augmentation
method. This survey aims to help in the selection of time series data
augmentation for neural network applications.</span>

                                        <span>We present an efficient low-rank approximation algorithm for non-negative
tensors. The algorithm is derived from our two findings: First, we show that
rank-1 approximation for tensors can be viewed as a mean-field approximation by
treating each tensor as a probability distribution. Second, we theoretically
provide a sufficient condition for distribution parameters to reduce Tucker
ranks of tensors and, interestingly, this sufficient condition can be achieved
by iterative application of the mean-field approximation. Since the mean-field
approximation is always given as a closed formula, our findings lead to a fast
low-rank approximation algorithm without using a gradient method. We
empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster than the existing
non-negative Tucker rank reduction methods with achieving competitive or better
approximation of given tensors.</span>

                                        <span>Among the very first variance reduced stochastic methods for solving the
empirical risk minimization problem was the SVRG method (Johnson &amp; Zhang 2013).
SVRG is an inner-outer loop based method, where in the outer loop a reference
full gradient is evaluated, after which $m \in \mathbb{N}$ steps of an inner
loop are executed where the reference gradient is used to build a variance
reduced estimate of the current gradient. The simplicity of the SVRG method and
its analysis have led to multiple extensions and variants for even non-convex
optimization. We provide a more general analysis of SVRG than had been
previously done by using arbitrary sampling, which allows us to analyse
virtually all forms of mini-batching through a single theorem. Furthermore, our
analysis is focused on more practical variants of SVRG including a new variant
of the loopless SVRG (Hofman et al 2015, Kovalev et al 2019, Kulunchakov and
Mairal 2019) and a variant of k-SVRG (Raj and Stich 2018) where $m&#x3D;n$ and where
$n$ is the number of data points. Since our setup and analysis reflect what is
done in practice, we are able to set the parameters such as the mini-batch size
and step size using our theory in such a way that produces a more efficient
algorithm in practice, as we show in extensive numerical experiments.</span>

                                        <span>Randomized smoothing is a recent technique that achieves state-of-art
performance in training certifiably robust deep neural networks. While the
smoothing family of distributions is often connected to the choice of the norm
used for certification, the parameters of these distributions are always set as
global hyper parameters independent of the input data on which a network is
certified. In this work, we revisit Gaussian randomized smoothing and show that
the variance of the Gaussian distribution can be optimized at each input so as
to maximize the certification radius for the construction of the smoothed
classifier. This new approach is generic, parameter-free, and easy to
implement. In fact, we show that our data dependent framework can be seamlessly
incorporated into 3 randomized smoothing approaches, leading to consistent
improved certified accuracy. When this framework is used in the training
routine of these approaches followed by a data dependent certification, we
achieve 9\% and 6\% improvement over the certified accuracy of the strongest
baseline for a radius of 0.5 on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</span>

                                        <span>Meta learning approaches to few-shot classification are computationally
efficient at test time requiring just a few optimization steps or single
forward pass to learn a new task, but they remain highly memory-intensive to
train. This limitation arises because a task&#x27;s entire support set, which can
contain up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be
taken. Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires
either parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be
available, or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints
apply. We improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory
efficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks
composed of large images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the
gradients for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task&#x27;s
training images. This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task&#x27;s entire
training set but realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a
random subset of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the
full gradient. We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4
parts of the challenging VTAB+MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners.
LITE also enables meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning
approaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost, thus serving
as a counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer learning is all you
need for few-shot classification.</span>

based on a conditional generative adversarial network. Given an observed graph

experiments on three real-world network datasets demonstrate our model&#x27;s

known to be universally representable by neural networks that enforce
permutation invariance. These architectures only give guarantees for fixed
input sizes, yet in many practical applications, including point clouds and
particle physics, a relevant notion of generalization should include varying
the input size. In this work we treat symmetric functions (of any size) as
functions over probability measures, and study the learning and representation
of neural networks defined on measures. By focusing on shallow architectures,
we establish approximation and generalization bounds under different choices of
regularization (such as RKHS and variation norms), that capture a hierarchy of
functional spaces with increasing degree of non-linear learning. The resulting
models can be learned efficiently and enjoy generalization guarantees that
extend across input sizes, as we verify empirically.</span>

many scientific researchers are turning to machine learning (ML) techniques to
analyze large scale ensemble data. With complexities such as multi-component
workflows, heterogeneous machine architectures, parallel file systems, and
batch scheduling, care must be taken to facilitate this analysis in a high
performance computing (HPC) environment. In this paper, we present Merlin, a
workflow framework to enable large ML-friendly ensembles of scientific HPC
simulations. By augmenting traditional HPC with distributed compute
technologies, Merlin aims to lower the barrier for scientific subject matter
experts to incorporate ML into their analysis. In addition to its design, we
describe some example applications that Merlin has enabled on leadership-class

experiments and the calibration of infectious disease models to study the

                                        <span>Road roughness is a very important road condition for the infrastructure, as
the roughness affects both the safety and ride comfort of passengers. The roads
deteriorate over time which means the road roughness must be continuously
monitored in order to have an accurate understand of the condition of the road
infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline for road
roughness prediction using the vertical acceleration of the car and the car
speed. We compared well-known supervised machine learning models such as linear
regression, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, support vector
machine, and the multi-layer perceptron neural network. The models are trained
on an optimally selected set of features computed in the temporal and
statistical domain. The results demonstrate that machine learning methods can
accurately predict road roughness, using the recordings of the cost
approachable in-vehicle sensors installed in conventional passenger cars. Our
findings demonstrate that the technology is well suited to meet future pavement
condition monitoring, by enabling continuous monitoring of a wide road network.</span>

                                        <span>Language identification of social media text has been an interesting problem
of study in recent years. Social media messages are predominantly in code mixed
in non-English speaking states. Prior knowledge by pre-training contextual
embeddings have shown state of the art results for a range of downstream tasks.
Recently, models such as BERT have shown that using a large amount of unlabeled
data, the pretrained language models are even more beneficial for learning
common language representations. Extensive experiments exploiting transfer
learning and fine-tuning BERT models to identify language on Twitter are
presented in this paper. The work utilizes a data collection of
Hindi-English-Urdu codemixed text for language pre-training and Hindi-English
codemixed for subsequent word-level language classification. The results show
that the representations pre-trained over codemixed data produce better results
by their monolingual counterpart.</span>

                                        <span>Besides accuracy, the model size of convolutional neural networks (CNN)
models is another important factor considering limited hardware resources in
practical applications. For example, employing deep neural networks on mobile
systems requires the design of accurate yet fast CNN for low latency in
classification and object detection. To fulfill the need, we aim at obtaining
CNN models with both high testing accuracy and small size to address resource
constraints in many embedded devices. In particular, this paper focuses on
proposing a generic reinforcement learning-based model compression approach in
a two-stage compression pipeline: pruning and quantization. The first stage of
compression, i.e., pruning, is achieved via exploiting deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to co-learn the accuracy and the FLOPs updated after layer-wise
channel pruning and element-wise variational pruning via information dropout.
The second stage, i.e., quantization, is achieved via a similar DRL approach
but focuses on obtaining the optimal bits representation for individual layers.
We further conduct experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For
the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGGNet by 9x
from 20.04MB to 2.2MB with a slight accuracy increase. For the ImageNet
dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGG-16 by 33x from 138MB to
4.14MB with no accuracy loss.</span>

                                        <span>Causal structure discovery (CSD) models are making inroads into several
domains, including Earth system sciences. Their widespread adaptation is
however hampered by the fact that the resulting models often do not take into
account the domain knowledge of the experts and that it is often necessary to
modify the resulting models iteratively. We present a workflow that is required
to take this knowledge into account and to apply CSD algorithms in Earth system
sciences. At the same time, we describe open research questions that still need
to be addressed. We present a way to interactively modify the outputs of the
CSD algorithms and argue that the user interaction can be modelled as a greedy
finding of the local maximum-a-posteriori solution of the likelihood function,
which is composed of the likelihood of the causal model and the prior
distribution representing the knowledge of the expert user. We use a real-world
data set for examples constructed in collaboration with our co-authors, who are
the domain area experts. We show that finding maximally usable causal models in
the Earth system sciences or other similar domains is a difficult task which
contains many interesting open research questions. We argue that taking the
domain knowledge into account has a substantial effect on the final causal
models discovered.</span>

                                        <span>Successful applications of InfoNCE and its variants have popularized the use
of contrastive variational mutual information (MI) estimators in machine
learning. While featuring superior stability, these estimators crucially depend
on costly large-batch training, and they sacrifice bound tightness for variance
reduction. To overcome these limitations, we revisit the mathematics of popular
variational MI bounds from the lens of unnormalized statistical modeling and
convex optimization. Our investigation not only yields a new unified
theoretical framework encompassing popular variational MI bounds but also leads
to a novel, simple, and powerful contrastive MI estimator named as FLO.
Theoretically, we show that the FLO estimator is tight, and it provably
converges under stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, our FLO estimator
overcomes the limitations of its predecessors and learns more efficiently. The
utility of FLO is verified using an extensive set of benchmarks, which also
reveals the trade-offs in practical MI estimation.</span>

the evolution of cyber attacks, developing novel cybersecurity tools has become

provides a systematic review of the application of deep learning (DL)
approaches for cybersecurity. This paper provides a short description of DL
methods which is used in cybersecurity, including deep belief networks,
generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and others. Next,
we illustrate the differences between shallow learning and DL. Moreover, a
discussion is provided on the currently prevailing cyber-attacks in IoT and
other networks, and the effectiveness of DL methods to manage these attacks.
Besides, this paper describes studies that highlight the DL technique,
cybersecurity applications, and the source of datasets. Next, a discussion is
provided on the feasibility of DL systems for malware detection and
classification, intrusion detection, and other frequent cyber-attacks,
including identifying file type, spam, and network traffic. Our review
indicates that high classification accuracy of 99.72% is obtained by restricted

models, such as VoiceFilter-Lite, to support an arbitrary number of enrolled
users in a single pass. This is achieved by using an attention mechanism on
multiple speaker embeddings to compute a single attentive embedding, which is
then used as a side input to the model. We implemented multi-user
VoiceFilter-Lite and evaluated it for three tasks: (1) a streaming automatic
speech recognition (ASR) task; (2) a text-independent speaker verification
task; and (3) a personalized keyphrase detection task, where ASR has to detect
keyphrases from multiple enrolled users in a noisy environment. Our experiments
show that, with up to four enrolled users, multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite is able
to significantly reduce speech recognition and speaker verification errors when
there is overlapping speech, without affecting performance under other acoustic

                                        <span>Understanding unsupervised domain adaptation has been an important task that
has been well explored. However, the wide variety of methods have not analyzed
the role of a classifier&#x27;s performance in detail. In this paper, we thoroughly
examine the role of a classifier in terms of matching source and target
distributions. We specifically investigate the classifier ability by matching
a) the distribution of features, b) probabilistic uncertainty for samples and
c) certainty activation mappings. Our analysis suggests that using these three
distributions does result in a consistently improved performance on all the
datasets. Our work thus extends present knowledge on the role of the various
distributions obtained from the classifier towards solving unsupervised domain
adaptation.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce two quantum algorithms for solving structured prediction
problems. We first show that a stochastic gradient descent that uses the
quantum minimum finding algorithm and takes its probabilistic failure into
account solves the structured prediction problem with a runtime that scales
with the square root of the size of the label space, and in $\widetilde
O\left(1/\epsilon\right)$ with respect to the precision, $\epsilon$, of the
solution. Motivated by robust inference techniques in machine learning, we then
introduce another quantum algorithm that solves a smooth approximation of the
structured prediction problem with a similar quantum speedup in the size of the
label space and a similar scaling in the precision parameter. In doing so, we
analyze a variant of stochastic gradient descent for convex optimization in the
presence of an additive error in the calculation of the gradients, and show
that its convergence rate does not deteriorate if the additive errors are of
the order $O(\sqrt\epsilon)$. This algorithm uses quantum Gibbs sampling at
temperature $\Omega (\epsilon)$ as a subroutine. Based on these theoretical
observations, we propose a method for using quantum Gibbs samplers to combine
feedforward neural networks with probabilistic graphical models for quantum
machine learning. Our numerical results using Monte Carlo simulations on an
image tagging task demonstrate the benefit of the approach.</span>

vector fields of pixel displacements and to other parameterized geometric
deformations e.g. translations, rotations, etc. Current input deformation
certification methods either (i) do not scale to deep networks on large input

DeformRS-VF and DeformRS-Par, respectively. Our new formulation scales to large
networks on large input datasets. For instance, DeformRS-Par certifies rich
deformations, covering translations, rotations, scaling, affine deformations,
and other visually aligned deformations such as ones parameterized by
Discrete-Cosine-Transform basis. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10 and
ImageNet show that DeformRS-Par outperforms existing state-of-the-art in

ResNet into several shallow sub-ResNets that are trained independently in a

synchronized and aggregated into the global model. In the next round, new

per iteration, {\rm \texttt{ResIST}} communicates only a small portion of
network parameters to each machine and never uses the full model during
training. Thus, {\rm \texttt{ResIST}} reduces the communication, memory, and
time requirements of ResNet training to only a fraction of the requirements of
previous methods. In comparison to common protocols like data-parallel training

                                        <span>Metro origin-destination prediction is a crucial yet challenging task for
intelligent transportation management, which aims to accurately forecast two
specific types of cross-station ridership, i.e., Origin-Destination (OD) one
and Destination-Origin (DO) one. However, complete OD matrices of previous time
intervals can not be obtained immediately in online metro systems, and
conventional methods only used limited information to forecast the future OD
and DO ridership separately.In this work, we proposed a novel neural network
module termed Heterogeneous Information Aggregation Machine (HIAM), which fully
exploits heterogeneous information of historical data (e.g., incomplete OD
matrices, unfinished order vectors, and DO matrices) to jointly learn the
evolutionary patterns of OD and DO ridership. Specifically, an OD modeling
branch estimates the potential destinations of unfinished orders explicitly to
complement the information of incomplete OD matrices, while a DO modeling
branch takes DO matrices as input to capture the spatial-temporal distribution
of DO ridership. Moreover, a Dual Information Transformer is introduced to
propagate the mutual information among OD features and DO features for modeling
the OD-DO causality and correlation. Based on the proposed HIAM, we develop a
unified Seq2Seq network to forecast the future OD and DO ridership
simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for online metro origin-destination
prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based segmentation methods are vulnerable to unforeseen data
distribution shifts during deployment, e.g. change of image appearances or
contrasts caused by different scanners, unexpected imaging artifacts etc. In
this paper, we present a cooperative framework for training image segmentation
models and a latent space augmentation method for generating hard examples.
Both contributions improve model generalization and robustness with limited
data. The cooperative training framework consists of a fast-thinking network
(FTN) and a slow-thinking network (STN). The FTN learns decoupled image
features and shape features for image reconstruction and segmentation tasks.
The STN learns shape priors for segmentation correction and refinement. The two
networks are trained in a cooperative manner. The latent space augmentation
generates challenging examples for training by masking the decoupled latent
space in both channel-wise and spatial-wise manners. We performed extensive
experiments on public cardiac imaging datasets. Using only 10 subjects from a
single site for training, we demonstrated improved cross-site segmentation
performance and increased robustness against various unforeseen imaging
artifacts compared to strong baseline methods. Particularly, cooperative
training with latent space data augmentation yields 15% improvement in terms of
average Dice score when compared to a standard training method.</span>

one of several requirements. In this paper, we assay a complementary
perspective originating from the increasing availability of pre-trained and
regularly improving state-of-the-art models. While new improved models develop
at a fast pace, downstream tasks vary more slowly or stay constant. Assume that
we have a large unlabelled data set for which we want to maintain accurate
predictions. Whenever a new and presumably better ML models becomes available,
we encounter two problems: (i) given a limited budget, which data points should
be re-evaluated using the new model?; and (ii) if the new predictions differ
from the current ones, should we update? Problem (i) is about compute cost,
which matters for very large data sets and models. Problem (ii) is about
maintaining consistency of the predictions, which can be highly relevant for
downstream applications; our demand is to avoid negative flips, i.e., changing
correct to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we formalize the Prediction
Update Problem and present an efficient probabilistic approach as answer to the
above questions. In extensive experiments on standard classification benchmark
data sets, we show that our method outperforms alternative strategies along key
metrics for backward-compatible prediction updates.</span>

precision-recall curves (AUPRC), which is widely used for combating imbalanced
classification tasks. Although a few methods have been proposed for maximizing
AUPRC, stochastic optimization of AUPRC with convergence guarantee remains an
undeveloped territory. A recent work [42] has proposed a promising approach
towards AUPRC based on maximizing a surrogate loss for the average precision,
and proved an $O(1/\epsilon^5)$ complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary
solution of the non-convex objective. In this paper, we further improve the
stochastic optimization of AURPC by (i) developing novel stochastic momentum
methods with a better iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^4)$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution; and (ii) designing a novel family of stochastic
adaptive methods with the same iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^4)$, which
enjoy faster convergence in practice. To this end, we propose two innovative
techniques that are critical for improving the convergence: (i) the biased
estimators for tracking individual ranking scores are updated in a randomized
coordinate-wise manner; and (ii) a momentum update is used on top of the
stochastic gradient estimator for tracking the gradient of the objective.
Extensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms. Of independent interest, the proposed stochastic momentum
and adaptive algorithms are also applicable to a class of two-level stochastic
dependent compositional optimization problems.</span>

                                        <span>Domain-specific data is the crux of the successful transfer of machine
learning systems from benchmarks to real life. Crowdsourcing has become one of
the standard tools for cheap and time-efficient data collection for simple
problems such as image classification: thanks in large part to advances in
research on aggregation methods. However, the applicability of crowdsourcing to
more complex tasks (e.g., speech recognition) remains limited due to the lack
of principled aggregation methods for these modalities. The main obstacle
towards designing advanced aggregation methods is the absence of training data,
and in this work, we focus on bridging this gap in speech recognition. For
this, we collect and release CrowdSpeech -- the first publicly available
large-scale dataset of crowdsourced audio transcriptions. Evaluation of
existing aggregation methods on our data shows room for improvement, suggesting
that our work may entail the design of better algorithms. At a higher level, we
also contribute to the more general challenge of collecting high-quality
datasets using crowdsourcing: we develop a principled pipeline for constructing
datasets of crowdsourced audio transcriptions in any novel domain. We show its
applicability on an under-resourced language by constructing VoxDIY -- a
counterpart of CrowdSpeech for the Russian language. We also release the code
that allows a full replication of our data collection pipeline and share
various insights on best practices of data collection via crowdsourcing.</span>

neural networks. While we focus on convolutional networks, our framework can be
extrapolated to any network architecture. In particular, we evaluate two
network properties, namely, capacity (related to expressivity) and compression,
both of which depend only on the network structure and are independent of the
training and test data. To this end, we propose two metrics: the first one,
called layer complexity, captures the architectural complexity of any network
layer; and, the second one, called layer intrinsic power, encodes how data is
compressed along the network. The metrics are based on the concept of layer
algebra, which is also introduced in this paper. This concept is based on the
idea that the global properties depend on the network topology, and the leaf
nodes of any neural network can be approximated using local transfer functions,
thereby, allowing a simple computation of the global metrics. We also compare
the properties of the state-of-the art architectures using our metrics and use
the properties to analyze the classification accuracy on benchmark datasets.</span>

                                        <span>This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative
procedures, such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions
from the standard classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group
fairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected
groups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry
historical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground
truth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a
single group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or
further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in
them is an impossible dilemma and being &quot;fair&quot; with respect to Asians may
require being &quot;unfair&quot; with respect to South Asians. This motivates the
introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the
relevant groupings.

We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their
incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of
demographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible}
to achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we
introduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously
through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results
and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models.</span>

tremendously successful in recent years. However, these contrastive schemes are
notoriously resource demanding, as their effectiveness breaks down with
small-batch training (i.e., the log-K curse, whereas K is the batch-size). In
this work, we reveal mathematically why contrastive learners fail in the
small-batch-size regime, and present a novel simple, non-trivial contrastive
objective named FlatNCE, which fixes this issue. Unlike InfoNCE, our FlatNCE no
longer explicitly appeals to a discriminative classification goal for
contrastive learning. Theoretically, we show FlatNCE is the mathematical dual
formulation of InfoNCE, thus bridging the classical literature on energy
modeling; and empirically, we demonstrate that, with minimal modification of
code, FlatNCE enables immediate performance boost independent of the
subject-matter engineering efforts. The significance of this work is furthered
by the powerful generalization of contrastive learning techniques, and the
introduction of new tools to monitor and diagnose contrastive training. We
substantiate our claims with empirical evidence on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and other
datasets, where FlatNCE consistently outperforms InfoNCE.</span>

optimization problems. Our approach is broadly applicable to canonical NP-hard
problems in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems,
such as maximum cut, minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, as well as
Ising spin glasses and higher-order generalizations thereof in the form of
polynomial unconstrained binary optimization problems. We apply a relaxation
strategy to the problem Hamiltonian to generate a differentiable loss function
with which we train the graph neural network and apply a simple projection to
integer variables once the unsupervised training process has completed. We

                                        <span>Classical machine learning approaches are sensitive to non-stationarity.
Transfer learning can address non-stationarity by sharing knowledge from one
system to another, however, in areas like machine prognostics and defense, data
is fundamentally limited. Therefore, transfer learning algorithms have little,
if any, examples from which to learn. Herein, we suggest that these constraints
on algorithmic learning can be addressed by systems engineering. We formally
define transfer distance in general terms and demonstrate its use in
empirically quantifying the transferability of models. We consider the use of
transfer distance in the design of machine rebuild procedures to allow for
transferable prognostic models. We also consider the use of transfer distance
in predicting operational performance in computer vision. Practitioners can use
the presented methodology to design and operate systems with consideration for
the learning theoretic challenges faced by component learning systems.</span>

                                        <span>The use of pessimism, when reasoning about datasets lacking exhaustive
exploration has recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement learning.
Despite the robustness it adds to the algorithm, overly pessimistic reasoning
can be equally damaging in precluding the discovery of good policies, which is
an issue for the popular bonus-based pessimism. In this paper, we introduce the
notion of Bellman-consistent pessimism for general function approximation:
instead of calculating a point-wise lower bound for the value function, we
implement pessimism at the initial state over the set of functions consistent
with the Bellman equations. Our theoretical guarantees only require Bellman
closedness as standard in the exploratory setting, in which case bonus-based
pessimism fails to provide guarantees. Even in the special case of linear MDPs
where stronger function-approximation assumptions hold, our result improves
upon a recent bonus-based approach by $\mathcal{O}(d)$ in its sample complexity
when the action space is finite. Remarkably, our algorithms automatically adapt
to the best bias-variance tradeoff in the hindsight, whereas most prior
approaches require tuning extra hyperparameters a priori.</span>

Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Adaptive Multi-step Bootstrap (AMB), which
enjoys a stronger gap-dependent regret bound. The first innovation is to
estimate the optimal $Q$-function by combining an optimistic bootstrap with an
adaptive multi-step Monte Carlo rollout. The second innovation is to select the
action with the largest confidence interval length among admissible actions
that are not dominated by any other actions. We show when each state has a
unique optimal action, AMB achieves a gap-dependent regret bound that only
scales with the sum of the inverse of the sub-optimality gaps. In contrast,
Simchowitz and Jamieson (2019) showed all upper-confidence-bound (UCB)
algorithms suffer an additional $\Omega\left(\frac{S}{\Delta_{min}}\right)$
regret due to over-exploration where $\Delta_{min}$ is the minimum
sub-optimality gap and $S$ is the number of states. We further show that for
general MDPs, AMB suffers an additional $\frac{|Z_{mul}|}{\Delta_{min}}$
regret, where $Z_{mul}$ is the set of state-action pairs $(s,a)$&#x27;s satisfying
$a$ is a non-unique optimal action for $s$. We complement our upper bound with
a lower bound showing the dependency on $\frac{|Z_{mul}|}{\Delta_{min}}$ is
unavoidable for any consistent algorithm. This lower bound also implies a
separation between reinforcement learning and contextual bandits.</span>

to adjust the dynamics of neural network parameters. This has been used as one
of the key interventions in an empirical study of lazy and active behavior.
However, we show that the combination of such scaling and a commonly used
adaptive learning rate optimizer strongly affects the training behavior of the
neural network. This is problematic as it can cause \emph{unintended behavior}
of neural networks, resulting in the misinterpretation of experimental results.
Specifically, for some scaling settings, the effect of the adaptive learning
rate disappears or is strongly influenced by the scaling factor. To avoid the
unintended effect, we present a modification of an optimization algorithm and
demonstrate remarkable differences between adaptive learning rate optimization
and simple gradient descent, especially with a small ($&lt;1.0$) scaling factor.</span>

demonstrate the generality and robustness of FF-NSL, we use two datasets
subject to distributional shifts, for which pre-trained NNs may give incorrect

strategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to
follow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\deg}C with no or limited
overshoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an
inevitable increase of the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and
a drastic decrease in terms of the total consumption of fossil fuels.
Therefore, this thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems
by investigating forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to
conventional power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of
the generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable,
and their production is stochastic and hard to predict in advance. A high share
of renewables is a great challenge for power systems that have been designed
and sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts,
which aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations,
have become an important tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to
better decisions in energy applications. This thesis focus on two main research
questions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic forecasts of renewable
generation, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with
uncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy
management of &quot;small&quot; systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a
day-ahead basis. It is divided into two main parts to propose directions to
address both research questions (1) a forecasting part; (2) a planning and
control part.</span>

those in the training. In sharp contrast, the typical and traditional designs
of optimization methods are theory-driven, so they obtain performance
guarantees over the classes of problems specified by the theory. The difference
makes L2O suitable for repeatedly solving a certain type of optimization
problems over a specific distribution of data, while it typically fails on
out-of-distribution problems. The practicality of L2O depends on the type of
target optimization, the chosen architecture of the method to learn, and the
training procedure. This new paradigm has motivated a community of researchers
to explore L2O and report their findings.

This article is poised to be the first comprehensive survey and benchmark of
L2O for continuous optimization. We set up taxonomies, categorize existing
works and research directions, present insights, and identify open challenges.
We also benchmarked many existing L2O approaches on a few but representative
optimization problems. For reproducible research and fair benchmarking
purposes, we released our software implementation and data in the package
Open-L2O at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Open-L2O.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce kernel thinning, a new procedure for compressing a distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ more effectively than i.i.d. sampling or standard thinning. Given
a suitable reproducing kernel $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, kernel
thinning compresses an $n$-point approximation to $\mathbb{P}$ into a
$\sqrt{n}$-point approximation with comparable worst-case integration error in
the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. With high probability, the
maximum discrepancy in integration error is
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{\log n})$ for compactly supported
$\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt{(\log n)^{d+1}\log\log
n})$ for sub-exponential $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In contrast, an
equal-sized i.i.d. sample from $\mathbb{P}$ suffers $\Omega(n^{-\frac14})$
integration error. Our sub-exponential guarantees resemble the classical
quasi-Monte Carlo error rates for uniform $\mathbb{P}$ on $[0,1]^d$ but apply
to general distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide range of common kernels.
We use our results to derive explicit non-asymptotic maximum mean discrepancy
bounds for Gaussian, Mat\&#x27;ern, and B-spline kernels and present two vignettes
illustrating the practical benefits of kernel thinning over i.i.d. sampling and
standard Markov chain Monte Carlo thinning.</span>

                                        <span>Cyberattacks are a major issues and it causes organizations great financial,
and reputation harm. However, due to various factors, the current network
intrusion detection systems (NIDS) seem to be insufficent. Predominant NIDS
identifies Cyberattacks through a handcrafted dataset of rules. Although the
recent applications of machine learning and deep learning have alleviated the
enormous effort in NIDS, the security of network data has always been a prime
concern. However, to encounter the security problem and enable sharing among
organizations, Federated Learning (FL) scheme is employed. Although the current
FL systems have been successful, a network&#x27;s data distribution does not always
fit into a single global model as in FL. Thus, in such cases, having a single
global model in FL is no feasible. In this paper, we propose a
Segmented-Federated Learning (Segmented-FL) learning scheme for a more
efficient NIDS. The Segmented-FL approach employs periodic local model
evaluation based on which the segmentation occurs. We aim to bring similar
network environments to the same group. Further, the Segmented-FL system is
coupled with a weighted aggregation of local model parameters based on the
number of data samples a worker possesses to further augment the performance.
The improved performance by our system as compared to the FL and centralized
systems on standard dataset further validates our system and makes a strong
case for extending our technique across various tasks. The solution finds its
application in organizations that want to collaboratively learn on diverse
network environments and protect the privacy of individual datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Weakly-supervised anomaly detection aims at learning an anomaly detector from
a limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Recent works
build deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping
the normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature
space or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of
annotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative
loss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel
strategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that
could be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder
to encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,
reconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new
representation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test
sample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its
projection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we
also propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three
factors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy
are clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive
methods.</span>

                                        <span>In complex industrial settings, it is common practice to monitor the
operation of machines in order to detect undesired states, adjust maintenance
schedules, optimize system performance or collect usage statistics of
individual machines. In this work, we focus on estimating the power output of a
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) machine of a medium-sized company facility by
analyzing the total facility power consumption. We formulate the problem as a
time-series classification problem where the class label represents the CHP
power output. As the facility is fully instrumented and sensor measurements
from the CHP are available, we generate the training labels in an automated
fashion from the CHP sensor readings. However, sensor failures result in
mislabeled training data samples which are hard to detect and remove from the
dataset. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-task deep learning approach that
jointly trains a classifier and an autoencoder with a shared embedding
representation. The proposed approach targets to gradually correct the
mislabelled data samples during training in a self-supervised fashion, without
any prior assumption on the amount of label noise. We benchmark our approach on
several time-series classification datasets and find it to be comparable and
sometimes better than state-of-the-art methods. On the real-world use-case of
predicting the CHP power output, we thoroughly evaluate the architectural
design choices and show that the final architecture considerably increases the
robustness of the learning process and consistently beats other recent
state-of-the-art algorithms in the presence of unstructured as well as
structured label noise.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose Textual Echo Cancellation (TEC) - a framework for
cancelling the text-to-speech (TTS) playback echo from overlapping speech
recordings. Such a system can largely improve speech recognition performance
and user experience for intelligent devices such as smart speakers, as the user
can talk to the device while the device is still playing the TTS signal
responding to the previous query. We implement this system by using a novel
sequence-to-sequence model with multi-source attention that takes both the
microphone mixture signal and source text of the TTS playback as inputs, and
predicts the enhanced audio. Experiments show that the textual information of
the TTS playback is critical to enhancement performance. Besides, the text
sequence is much smaller in size compared with the raw acoustic signal of the
TTS playback, and can be immediately transmitted to the device or ASR server
even before the playback is synthesized. Therefore, our proposed approach
effectively reduces Internet communication and latency compared with
alternative approaches such as acoustic echo cancellation (AEC).</span>

                                        <span>The conditional gradient method (CGM) is widely used in large-scale sparse
convex optimization, having a low per iteration computational cost for
structured sparse regularizers and a greedy approach to collecting nonzeros. We
explore the sparsity acquiring properties of a general penalized CGM (P-CGM)
for convex regularizers and a reweighted penalized CGM (RP-CGM) for nonconvex
regularizers, replacing the usual convex constraints with gauge-inspired
penalties. This generalization does not increase the per-iteration complexity
noticeably. Without assuming bounded iterates or using line search, we show
$O(1/t)$ convergence of the gap of each subproblem, which measures distance to
a stationary point. We couple this with a screening rule which is safe in the
convex case, converging to the true support at a rate $O(1/(\delta^2))$ where
$\delta \geq 0$ measures how close the problem is to degeneracy. In the
nonconvex case the screening rule converges to the true support in a finite
number of iterations, but is not necessarily safe in the intermediate iterates.
In our experiments, we verify the consistency of the method and adjust the
aggressiveness of the screening rule by tuning the concavity of the
regularizer.</span>

(e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) with increasing levels of abstraction
that can be hierarchically combined. However, existing deep models with stacked
layers do not explicitly model any sort of hierarchical process. This paper
proposes a recursive Transformer model based on differentiable CKY style binary
trees to emulate the composition process. We extend the bidirectional language
model pre-training objective to this architecture, attempting to predict each
word given its left and right abstraction nodes. To scale up our approach, we
also introduce an efficient pruned tree induction algorithm to enable encoding
in just a linear number of composition steps. Experimental results on language

                                        <span>High-dimensional data, where the dimension of the feature space is much
larger than sample size, arise in a number of statistical applications. In this
context, we construct the generalized multivariate sign transformation, defined
as a vector divided by its norm. For different choices of the norm function,
the resulting transformed vector adapts to certain geometrical features of the
data distribution. Building up on this idea, we obtain one-sample and
two-sample testing procedures for mean vectors of high-dimensional data using
these generalized sign vectors. These tests are based on U-statistics using
kernel inner products, do not require prohibitive assumptions, and are amenable
to a fast randomization-based implementation. Through experiments in a number
of data settings, we show that tests using generalized signs display higher
power than existing tests, while maintaining nominal type-I error rates.
Finally, we provide example applications on the MNIST and Minnesota Twin
Studies genomic data.</span>

networks across the sciences and opened up fundamental theoretical problems. In
particular, the fact that learning algorithms based on simple variants of
gradient methods are able to find near-optimal minima of highly nonconvex loss
functions is an unexpected feature of neural networks which needs to be
understood in depth. Such algorithms are able to fit the data almost perfectly,
even in the presence of noise, and yet they have excellent predictive
capabilities. Several empirical results have shown a reproducible correlation
between the so-called flatness of the minima achieved by the algorithms and the
generalization performance. At the same time, statistical physics results have
shown that in nonconvex networks a multitude of narrow minima may coexist with
a much smaller number of wide flat minima, which generalize well. Here we show
that wide flat minima arise from the coalescence of minima that correspond to
high-margin classifications. Despite being exponentially rare compared to
zero-margin solutions, high-margin minima tend to concentrate in particular
regions. These minima are in turn surrounded by other solutions of smaller and
smaller margin, leading to dense regions of solutions over long distances. Our
analysis also provides an alternative analytical method for estimating when
flat minima appear and when algorithms begin to find solutions, as the number
of model parameters varies.</span>

solve challenging problems, yet can be difficult to stabilize and understand.
Part of this complexity originates from the discrete update steps given by
simultaneous or alternating gradient descent, which causes each player to drift
away from the continuous gradient flow -- a phenomenon we call discretization
drift. Using backward error analysis, we derive modified continuous dynamical
systems that closely follow the discrete dynamics. These modified dynamics
provide an insight into the notorious challenges associated with zero-sum
games, including Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we identify
distinct components of the discretization drift that can alter performance and
in some cases destabilize the game. Finally, quantifying discretization drift
allows us to identify regularizers that explicitly cancel harmful forms of
drift or strengthen beneficial forms of drift, and thus improve performance of
GAN training.</span>

results in some specific problems such as predicting market direction and

                                        <span>Intestinal parasitic infection leads to several morbidities to humans
worldwide, especially in tropical countries. The traditional diagnosis usually
relies on manual analysis from microscopic images which is prone to human error
due to morphological similarity of different parasitic eggs and abundance of
impurities in a sample. Many studies have developed automatic systems for
parasite egg detection to reduce human workload. However, they work with high
quality microscopes, which unfortunately remain unaffordable in some rural
areas. Our work thus exploits a benefit of a low-cost USB microscope. This
instrument however provides poor quality of images due to limitation of
magnification (10x), causing difficulty in parasite detection and species
classification. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based technique using transfer
learning strategy to enhance the efficiency of automatic parasite
classification in poor-quality microscopic images. The patch-based technique
with sliding window is employed to search for location of the eggs. Two
networks, AlexNet and ResNet50, are examined with a trade-off between
architecture size and classification performance. The results show that our
proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art object recognition methods.
Our system combined with final decision from an expert may improve the real
faecal examination with low-cost microscopes.</span>

                                        <span>Mobile Sensing Apps have been widely used as a practical approach to collect
behavioral and health-related information from individuals and provide timely
intervention to promote health and well-beings, such as mental health and
chronic cares. As the objectives of mobile sensing could be either \emph{(a)
personalized medicine for individuals} or \emph{(b) public health for
populations}, in this work we review the design of these mobile sensing apps,
and propose to categorize the design of these apps/systems in two paradigms --
\emph{(i) Personal Sensing} and \emph{(ii) Crowd Sensing} paradigms. While both
sensing paradigms might incorporate with common ubiquitous sensing
technologies, such as wearable sensors, mobility monitoring, mobile data
offloading, and/or cloud-based data analytics to collect and process sensing
data from individuals, we present a novel taxonomy system with two major
components that can specify and classify apps/systems from aspects of the
life-cycle of mHealth Sensing: \emph{(1) Sensing Task Creation \&amp;
Participation}, \emph{(2) Health Surveillance \&amp; Data Collection}, and
\emph{(3) Data Analysis \&amp; Knowledge Discovery}. With respect to different
goals of the two paradigms, this work systematically reviews this field, and
summarizes the design of typical apps/systems in the view of the configurations
and interactions between these two components. In addition to summarization,
the proposed taxonomy system also helps figure out the potential directions of
mobile sensing for health from both personalized medicines and population
health perspectives.</span>

internationalization and development of civilization. Yet proper economic
utilization of additional energy generated by the Islanded Hybrid Microgrid
System (IHMS) that was not consumed by the load is a major global challenge. To
resolve the above-stated summons, this research focuses on a multi-optimal
combination of IHMS for the Penang Hill Resort located on Penang Island,
Malaysia, with effective use of redundant energy. To avail this excess energy
efficiently, an electrical heater along with a storage tank has been designed
concerning diversion load having proper energy management. Furthermore, the
system design has adopted the HOMER Pro software for profitable and practical
analysis. Alongside, MATLAB Simulink had stabilized the whole system by
representing the values of 2068 and 19,072 kW that have been determined as the
approximated peak and average load per day for the resort. Moreover, the
optimized IHMS is comprehended of Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Diesel Generator,
Wind Turbine, Battery, and Converter. Adjacent to this, the optimized system
ensued in having a Net Present Cost (NPC) of $21.66 million, Renewable Fraction
(RF) of 27.8%, Cost of Energy (COE) of $0.165/kWh, CO2 of 1,735,836 kg/year,
and excess energy of 517.29MWh per annum. Since the diesel generator lead
system was included in the scheme, a COE of $0.217/kWh, CO2 of 5,124,879
kg/year, and NPC of $23.25 million were attained. The amount of excess energy
is effectively utilized with an electrical heater as a diversion load.</span>

applications. In the context of this paper, we detect the level of
decomposition and corrosion on the walls of Saint Nicholas fort in Rhodes

have been evaluated over a set of 14 different orthorectified hyperspectral
images. Experimental setup in this study involves K-means, Spectral, Meanshift,
DBSCAN, Birch and Optics algorithms. For each of these techniques we evaluate
its performance by the use of performance metrics such as Calinski-Harabasz,
Davies-Bouldin indexes and Silhouette value. In this approach, we evaluate the
outcomes of the clustering methods by comparing them with a set of annotated
images which denotes the ground truth regarding the decomposition and/or
corrosion area of the original images. The results depict that a few clustering
techniques applied on the given dataset succeeded decent accuracy, precision,

is an important task for social and cultural studies as well as for Natural
Language Processing applications. Diachronic word embeddings (time-sensitive
vector representations of words that preserve their meaning) have become the
standard resource for this task. However, given the significant computational
resources needed for their generation, very few resources exist that make
diachronic word embeddings available to the scientific community.

In this paper we present DUKweb, a set of large-scale resources designed for
the diachronic analysis of contemporary English. DUKweb was created from the
JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996-2013), a very large archive which collects
resources from the Internet Archive that were hosted on domains ending in
&#x60;.uk&#x27;. DUKweb consists of a series word co-occurrence matrices and two types of
word embeddings for each year in the JISC UK Web Domain dataset. We show the
reuse potential of DUKweb and its quality standards via a case study on word
meaning change detection.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce WiCluster, a new machine learning (ML) approach for passive
indoor positioning using radio frequency (RF) channel state information (CSI).
WiCluster can predict both a zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D
position, without using any precise position labels during training. Prior
CSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric approaches using
digital signal-processing (DSP) and, more recently, parametric approaches
(e.g., fully supervised ML methods). However these do not handle the complexity
of real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for large-scale
commercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based method deteriorates
significantly in non-line-of-sight conditions, while supervised ML methods need
large amounts of hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In
contrast, WiCluster is both precise and requires weaker label-information that
can be easily collected. Our first contribution is a novel dimensionality
reduction method for charting. It combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale
clustering-loss to map the high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D
latent space. Our second contribution is two weakly supervised losses that map
this latent space into a Cartesian map, resulting in meter-accuracy position
results. These losses only require simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the
floorplan, approximate location of access-point locations and a few CSI packets
that are labeled with the corresponding zone in the floorplan. Thirdly, we
report results and a robustness study for 2D positioning in a single-floor
office building and 3D positioning in a two-floor home to show the robustness
of our method.</span>

                                        <span>Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) refers to the concept of placing computational
capability and applications at the edge of the network, providing benefits such
as reduced latency in handling client requests, reduced network congestion, and
improved performance of applications. The performance and reliability of MEC
are degraded significantly when one or several edge servers in the cluster are
overloaded. Especially when a server crashes due to the overload, it causes
service failures in MEC. In this work, an adaptive admission control policy to
prevent edge node from getting overloaded is presented. This approach is based
on a recently-proposed low complexity RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm
called SALMUT (Structure-Aware Learning for Multiple Thresholds), which
exploits the structure of the optimal admission control policy in multi-class
queues for an average-cost setting. We extend the framework to work for node
overload-protection problem in a discounted-cost setting. The proposed solution
is validated using several scenarios mimicking real-world deployments in two
different settings - computer simulations and a docker testbed. Our empirical
evaluations show that the total discounted cost incurred by SALMUT is similar
to state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms such as PPO (Proximal Policy
Optimization) and A2C (Advantage Actor Critic) but requires an order of
magnitude less time to train, outputs easily interpretable policy, and can be
deployed in an online manner.</span>

energy-efficient virtual reality (VR) experiences for wireless mobile users. To
ensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile
users and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint
(CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are
exploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the
wireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a
sequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users&#x27;
feeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption
constraints on access points (APs) and users&#x27; head-mounted displays (HMDs). The
problem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users&#x27;
accurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer
characteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state
network (ESN) learning method to predict users&#x27; tracking information by
training fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs.
With the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based
optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we
implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer
decision variables and solving a continuous power control problem to criticize
the integer decision variables. Finally, the performance of the proposed
algorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the impact of
different design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% energy-efficient than the benchmark
algorithms.</span>

connection for online video games that is more reliable and lower latency than
a standard internet connection. Users of the GPN technology benefit from a
stable and high-quality gaming experience for online games, which are hosted
and played across the world. After transforming a massive volume of raw

a given natural language query. In the state-of-the-art approaches, the
semantic similarity between code and query is quantified as the distance of
their representation in the shared vector space. In this paper, to improve the
vector space, we introduce tree-serialization methods on a simplified form of
AST and build the multimodal representation for the code data. We conduct
extensive experiments using a single corpus that is large-scale and

code search. Last, we define two intuitive quantification metrics oriented to
the completeness of semantic and syntactic information of the code data.</span>

                                        <span>With the rapid development of NLP research, leaderboards have emerged as one
tool to track the performance of various systems on various NLP tasks. They are
effective in this goal to some extent, but generally present a rather
simplistic one-dimensional view of the submitted systems, communicated only
through holistic accuracy numbers. In this paper, we present a new
conceptualization and implementation of NLP evaluation: the ExplainaBoard,
which in addition to inheriting the functionality of the standard leaderboard,
also allows researchers to (i) diagnose strengths and weaknesses of a single
system (e.g.~what is the best-performing system bad at?) (ii) interpret
relationships between multiple systems. (e.g.~where does system A outperform
system B? What if we combine systems A, B, and C?) and (iii) examine prediction
results closely (e.g.~what are common errors made by multiple systems, or in
what contexts do particular errors occur?). So far, ExplainaBoard covers more
than 400 systems, 50 datasets, 40 languages, and 12 tasks. ExplainaBoard keeps
updated and is recently upgraded by supporting (1) multilingual multi-task
benchmark, (2) meta-evaluation, and (3) more complicated task: machine
translation, which reviewers also suggested.} We not only released an online
platform on the website \url{this http URL} but also make
our evaluation tool an API with MIT Licence at Github
\url{https://github.com/neulab/explainaBoard} and PyPi
\url{https://pypi.org/project/interpret-eval/} that allows users to
conveniently assess their models offline. We additionally release all output
files from systems that we have run or collected to motivate &quot;output-driven&quot;
research in the future.</span>

                                        <span>We present an approach for efficiently training Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with non-stationary, high-dimensional
streaming data. Our training scheme does not require data-driven parameter
initialization (e.g., k-means) and can thus be trained based on a random
initialization. Furthermore, the approach allows mini-batch sizes as low as 1,
which are typical for streaming-data settings. Major problems in such settings
are undesirable local optima during early training phases and numerical
instabilities due to high data dimensionalities. We introduce an adaptive
annealing procedure to address the first problem, whereas numerical
instabilities are eliminated by using an exponential-free approximation to the
standard GMM log-likelihood. Experiments on a variety of visual and non-visual
benchmarks show that our SGD approach can be trained completely without, for
instance, k-means based centroid initialization. It also compares favorably to
an online variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM) - stochastic EM (sEM), which
it outperforms by a large margin for very high-dimensional data.</span>

the data. However, such systematic errors can be difficult to identify, as
model performance can only be broken down across sensitive groups when these
groups are known and explicitly labelled. This paper introduces a method for
discovering systematic errors, which we call the spotlight. The key idea is
that similar inputs tend to have similar representations in the final hidden
layer of a neural network. We leverage this structure by &quot;shining a spotlight&quot;
on this representation space to find contiguous regions where the model
performs poorly. We show that the spotlight surfaces semantically meaningful
areas of weakness in a wide variety of model architectures, including image
classifiers, language models, and recommender systems.</span>

space may require long acquisition time, owing to the large phase space volume
to be covered. In such case, the limited time available for data acquisition
can be a serious constraint for experiments in which multidimensional spectral
data are acquired. Here, taking angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) as an example, we demonstrate a denoising method that utilizes deep
learning as an intelligent way to overcome the constraint. With readily
available ARPES data and random generation of training data set, we
successfully trained the denoising neural network without overfitting. The
denoising neural network can remove the noise in the data while preserving its
intrinsic information. We show that the denoising neural network allows us to
perform similar level of second-derivative and line shape analysis on data
taken with two orders of magnitude less acquisition time. The importance of our
method lies in its applicability to any multidimensional spectral data that are
susceptible to statistical noise.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Metric Learning (DML) learns a non-linear semantic embedding from input
data that brings similar pairs together while keeps dissimilar data away from
each other. To this end, many different methods are proposed in the last decade
with promising results in various applications. The success of a DML algorithm
greatly depends on its loss function. However, no loss function is perfect, and
it deals only with some aspects of an optimal similarity embedding. Besides,
the generalizability of the DML on unseen categories during the test stage is
an important matter that is not considered by existing loss functions. To
address these challenges, we propose novel approaches to combine different
losses built on top of a shared deep feature extractor. The proposed ensemble
of losses enforces the deep model to extract features that are consistent with
all losses. Since the selected losses are diverse and each emphasizes different
aspects of an optimal semantic embedding, our effective combining methods yield
a considerable improvement over any individual loss and generalize well on
unseen categories. Here, there is no limitation in choosing loss functions, and
our methods can work with any set of existing ones. Besides, they can optimize
each loss function as well as its weight in an end-to-end paradigm with no need
to adjust any hyper-parameter. We evaluate our methods on some popular datasets
from the machine vision domain in conventional Zero-Shot-Learning (ZSL)
settings. The results are very encouraging and show that our methods outperform
all baseline losses by a large margin in all datasets.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Joint Energy-based Model (JEM) of Grathwohl et al. shows that a standard
softmax classifier can be reinterpreted as an energy-based model (EBM) for the
joint distribution p(x,y); the resulting model can be optimized to improve
calibration, robustness, and out-of-distribution detection, while generating
samples rivaling the quality of recent GAN-based approaches. However, the
softmax classifier that JEM exploits is inherently discriminative and its
latent feature space is not well formulated as probabilistic distributions,
which may hinder its potential for image generation and incur training
instability. We hypothesize that generative classifiers, such as Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), might be more suitable for image generation since
generative classifiers model the data generation process explicitly. This paper
therefore investigates an LDA classifier for image classification and
generation. In particular, the Max-Mahalanobis Classifier (MMC), a special case
of LDA, fits our goal very well. We show that our Generative MMC (GMMC) can be
trained discriminatively, generatively, or jointly for image classification and
generation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that GMMC achieves
state-of-the-art discriminative and generative performances, while
outperforming JEM in calibration, adversarial robustness, and
out-of-distribution detection by a significant margin. Our source code is

                                        <span>State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid
subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and
adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive
bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To
this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)
that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a
data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and
learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.
We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates
GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,
multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a
series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par
and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is
fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level
Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this
work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained
completely end-to-end.</span>

                                        <span>Building embodied autonomous agents capable of participating in social
interactions with humans is one of the main challenges in AI. Within the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) field, this objective motivated multiple works on
embodied language use. However, current approaches focus on language as a
communication tool in very simplified and non-diverse social situations: the
&quot;naturalness&quot; of language is reduced to the concept of high vocabulary size and
variability. In this paper, we argue that aiming towards human-level AI
requires a broader set of key social skills: 1) language use in complex and
variable social contexts; 2) beyond language, complex embodied communication in
multimodal settings within constantly evolving social worlds. We explain how
concepts from cognitive sciences could help AI to draw a roadmap towards
human-like intelligence, with a focus on its social dimensions. As a first
step, we propose to expand current research to a broader set of core social
skills. To do this, we present SocialAI, a benchmark to assess the acquisition
of social skills of DRL agents using multiple grid-world environments featuring
other (scripted) social agents. We then study the limits of a recent SOTA DRL
approach when tested on SocialAI and discuss important next steps towards
proficient social agents. Videos and code are available at

                                        <span>The rapid growth in the number of devices and their connectivity has enlarged
the attack surface and weakened cyber systems. As attackers become increasingly
sophisticated and resourceful, mere reliance on traditional cyber protection,
such as intrusion detection, firewalls, and encryption, is insufficient to
secure cyber systems. Cyber resilience provides a new security paradigm that
complements inadequate protection with resilience mechanisms. A Cyber-Resilient
Mechanism (CRM) adapts to the known or zero-day threats and uncertainties in
real-time and strategically responds to them to maintain the critical functions
of the cyber systems. Feedback architectures play a pivotal role in enabling
the online sensing, reasoning, and actuation of the CRM. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is an important class of algorithms that epitomize the feedback
architectures for cyber resiliency, allowing the CRM to provide dynamic and
sequential responses to attacks with limited prior knowledge of the attacker.
In this work, we review the literature on RL for cyber resiliency and discuss
the cyber-resilient defenses against three major types of vulnerabilities,
i.e., posture-related, information-related, and human-related vulnerabilities.
We introduce moving target defense, defensive cyber deception, and assistive
human security technologies as three application domains of CRMs to elaborate
on their designs. The RL technique also has vulnerabilities itself. We explain
the major vulnerabilities of RL and present several attack models in which the
attacks target the rewards, the measurements, and the actuators. We show that
the attacker can trick the RL agent into learning a nefarious policy with
minimum attacking effort, which shows serious security concerns for RL-enabled
systems. Finally, we discuss the future challenges of RL for cyber security and
resiliency and emerging applications of RL-based CRMs.</span>

black-box machine learning models and understanding how to change a particular
instance to obtain a desired outcome from the model. However, most existing
approaches assume instant materialization of these changes, ignoring that they
may require effort and a specific order of application. Recently, methods have
been proposed that also consider the order in which actions are applied,
leading to the so-called sequential counterfactual generation problem.

In this work, we propose a model-agnostic method for sequential
counterfactual generation. We formulate the task as a multi-objective
optimization problem and present a genetic algorithm approach to find optimal
sequences of actions leading to the counterfactuals. Our cost model considers
not only the direct effect of an action, but also its consequences.
Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art, our approach
generates less costly solutions, is more efficient and provides the user with a

before the learning process can start. To find the best configuration for these
hyperparameters in such a high dimensional space, with time-consuming and
expensive model training / validation, is not a trivial challenge. Bayesian
optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of hyperparameters,
efficiently trading off exploration and exploitation of the hyperparameter
space. In this paper, we discuss Bayesian hyperparameter optimization,
including hyperparameter optimization, Bayesian optimization, and Gaussian
processes. We also review BoTorch, GPyTorch and Ax, the new open-source
frameworks that we use for Bayesian optimization, Gaussian process inference
and adaptive experimentation, respectively. For experimentation, we apply
Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, for optimizing group weights, to weighted
group pooling, which couples unsupervised tiered graph autoencoders learning
and supervised graph prediction learning for molecular graphs. We find that Ax,
BoTorch and GPyTorch together provide a simple-to-use but powerful framework
for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, using Ax&#x27;s high-level API that

                                        <span>The last few years have seen gigantic leaps in algorithms and systems to
support efficient deep learning inference. Pruning and quantization algorithms
can now consistently compress neural networks by an order of magnitude. For a
compressed neural network, a multitude of inference frameworks have been
designed to maximize the performance of the target hardware. While we find
mature support for quantized neural networks in production frameworks such as
OpenVINO and MNN, support for pruned sparse neural networks is still lacking.
To tackle this challenge, we present SparseDNN, a sparse deep learning
inference engine targeting CPUs. We present both kernel-level optimizations
with a sparse code generator to accelerate sparse operators and novel
network-level optimizations catering to sparse networks. We show that our
sparse code generator can achieve significant speedups over state-of-the-art
sparse and dense libraries. On end-to-end benchmarks such as Huggingface
pruneBERT, SparseDNN achieves up to 5x throughput improvement over dense
inference with state-of-the-art OpenVINO.</span>

                                        <span>Inducing causal relationships from observations is a classic problem in
machine learning. Most work in causality starts from the premise that the
causal variables themselves are observed. However, for AI agents such as robots
trying to make sense of their environment, the only observables are low-level
variables like pixels in images. To generalize well, an agent must induce
high-level variables, particularly those which are causal or are affected by
causal variables. A central goal for AI and causality is thus the joint
discovery of abstract representations and causal structure. However, we note
that existing environments for studying causal induction are poorly suited for
this objective because they have complicated task-specific causal graphs which
are impossible to manipulate parametrically (e.g., number of nodes, sparsity,
causal chain length, etc.). In this work, our goal is to facilitate research in
learning representations of high-level variables as well as causal structures
among them. In order to systematically probe the ability of methods to identify
these variables and structures, we design a suite of benchmarking RL
environments. We evaluate various representation learning algorithms from the
literature and find that explicitly incorporating structure and modularity in
models can help causal induction in model-based reinforcement learning.</span>

SE(3)-equivariant neural network approach for learning interatomic potentials
from ab-initio calculations for molecular dynamics simulations. While most
contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on
scalars, NequIP employs SE(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of
geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful
representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy on a challenging set of diverse molecules and materials while
exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with
up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely
held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high
data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate
potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and
enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.</span>

theoretic perspective. They place emphasis on notions of domain and task, and
neglect notions of structure and behavior. In doing so, they limit the extent
to which formalism can be carried through into the elaboration of their
frameworks. Herein, we use Mesarovician systems theory to define transfer
learning as a relation on sets and subsequently characterize the general nature
of transfer learning as a mathematical construct. We interpret existing
frameworks in terms of ours and go beyond existing frameworks to define notions
of transferability, transfer roughness, and transfer distance. Importantly,
despite its formalism, our framework avoids the detailed mathematics of
learning theory or machine learning solution methods without excluding their
consideration. As such, we provide a formal, general systems framework for
modeling transfer learning that offers a rigorous foundation for system design
and analysis.</span>

                                        <span>In recent cross-disciplinary studies involving both optics and computing,
single-photon-based decision-making has been demonstrated by utilizing the
wave-particle duality of light to solve multi-armed bandit problems.
Furthermore, entangled-photon-based decision-making has managed to solve a
competitive multi-armed bandit problem in such a way that conflicts of
decisions among players are avoided while ensuring equality. However, as these
studies are based on the polarization of light, the number of available choices
is limited to two, corresponding to two orthogonal polarization states. Here we
propose a scalable principle to solve competitive decision-making situations by
using the orbital angular momentum as the tunable degree of freedom of photons,
which theoretically allows an unlimited number of arms. Moreover, by extending
the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to more than two states, we theoretically establish
an experimental configuration able to generate entangled photon states with
orbital angular momentum and conditions that provide conflict-free selections
at every turn. We numerically examine total rewards regarding three-armed
bandit problems, for which the proposed strategy accomplishes almost the
theoretical maximum, which is greater than a conventional mixed strategy
intending to realize Nash equilibrium. This is thanks to the entanglement
property that achieves no-conflict selections, even in the exploring phase to
find the best arms.</span>

                                        <span>Dependency networks (Heckerman et al., 2000) are potential probabilistic
graphical models for systems comprising a large number of variables. Like
Bayesian networks, the structure of a dependency network is represented by a
directed graph, and each node has a conditional probability table. Learning and
inference are realized locally on individual nodes; therefore, computation
remains tractable even with a large number of variables. However, the
dependency network&#x27;s learned distribution is the stationary distribution of a
Markov chain called pseudo-Gibbs sampling and has no closed-form expressions.
This technical disadvantage has impeded the development of dependency networks.
In this paper, we consider a certain manifold for each node. Then, we can
interpret pseudo-Gibbs sampling as iterative m-projections onto these
manifolds. This interpretation provides a theoretical bound for the location
where the stationary distribution of pseudo-Gibbs sampling exists in
distribution space. Furthermore, this interpretation involves structure and
parameter learning algorithms as optimization problems. In addition, we compare
dependency and Bayesian networks experimentally. The results demonstrate that
the dependency network and the Bayesian network have roughly the same
performance in terms of the accuracy of their learned distributions. The
results also show that the dependency network can learn much faster than the
Bayesian network.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning(FL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm with
default client privacy because clients can keep sensitive data on their devices
and only share local training parameter updates with the federated server.
However, recent studies reveal that gradient leakages in FL may compromise the
privacy of client training data. This paper presents a gradient leakage
resilient approach to privacy-preserving federated learning with per training
example-based client differential privacy, coined as Fed-CDP. It makes three
original contributions. First, we identify three types of client gradient
leakage threats in federated learning even with encrypted client-server
communications. We articulate when and why the conventional server coordinated
differential privacy approach, coined as Fed-SDP, is insufficient to protect
the privacy of the training data. Second, we introduce Fed-CDP, the per
example-based client differential privacy algorithm, and provide a formal
analysis of Fed-CDP with the $(\epsilon, \delta)$ differential privacy
guarantee, and a formal comparison between Fed-CDP and Fed-SDP in terms of
privacy accounting. Third, we formally analyze the privacy-utility trade-off
for providing differential privacy guarantee by Fed-CDP and present a dynamic
decay noise-injection policy to further improve the accuracy and resiliency of
Fed-CDP. We evaluate and compare Fed-CDP and Fed-CDP(decay) with Fed-SDP in
terms of differential privacy guarantee and gradient leakage resilience over
five benchmark datasets. The results show that the Fed-CDP approach outperforms
conventional Fed-SDP in terms of resilience to client gradient leakages while
offering competitive accuracy performance in federated learning.</span>

convolutional layers, a downsampling operator, and a fully connected layer. The
network structure depends on two structural parameters which determine the
numbers of convolutional layers and the width of the fully connected layer. We
establish an approximation theory with explicit approximation rates when the
approximated function takes a composite form $f\circ Q$ with a feature
polynomial $Q$ and a univariate function $f$. In particular, we prove that such
a network can outperform fully connected shallow networks in approximating
radial functions with $Q(x) &#x3D;|x|^2$, when the dimension $d$ of data from
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is large. This gives the first rigorous proof for the
superiority of deep convolutional neural networks in approximating functions
with special structures. Then we carry out generalization analysis for
empirical risk minimization with such a deep network in a regression framework
with the regression function of the form $f\circ Q$. Our network structure
which does not use any composite information or the functions $Q$ and $f$ can
automatically extract features and make use of the composite nature of the
regression function via tuning the structural parameters. Our analysis provides
an error bound which decreases with the network depth to a minimum and then
increases, verifying theoretically a trade-off phenomenon observed for network
depths in many practical applications.</span>

                                        <span>The double descent curve is one of the most intriguing properties of deep
neural networks. It contrasts the classical bias-variance curve with the
behavior of modern neural networks, occurring where the number of samples nears
the number of parameters. In this work, we explore the connection between the
double descent phenomena and the number of samples in the deep neural network
setting. In particular, we propose a construction which augments the existing
dataset by artificially increasing the number of samples. This construction
empirically mitigates the double descent curve in this setting. We reproduce
existing work on deep double descent, and observe a smooth descent into the
overparameterized region for our construction. This occurs both with respect to
the model size, and with respect to the number epochs.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of explainable $k$-medians and $k$-means introduced
by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian~(ICML 2020). In this problem,
our goal is to find a \emph{threshold decision tree} that partitions data into
$k$ clusters and minimizes the $k$-medians or $k$-means objective. The obtained
clustering is easy to interpret because every decision node of a threshold tree
splits data based on a single feature into two groups. We propose a new
algorithm for this problem which is $\tilde O(\log k)$ competitive with
$k$-medians with $\ell_1$ norm and $\tilde O(k)$ competitive with $k$-means.
This is an improvement over the previous guarantees of $O(k)$ and $O(k^2)$ by
Dasgupta et al (2020). We also provide a new algorithm which is $O(\log^{3/2}
k)$ competitive for $k$-medians with $\ell_2$ norm. Our first algorithm is
near-optimal: Dasgupta et al (2020) showed a lower bound of $\Omega(\log k)$
for $k$-medians; in this work, we prove a lower bound of $\tilde\Omega(k)$ for
$k$-means. We also provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\log k)$ for $k$-medians
with $\ell_2$ norm.</span>

including particle physics, astroparticle physics, and hadron- and nuclear
physics -- for supervised machine learning studies. These datasets, containing
hadronic top quarks, cosmic-ray induced air showers, phase transitions in
hadronic matter, and generator-level histories, are made public to simplify
future work on cross-disciplinary machine learning and transfer learning in
fundamental physics. Based on these data, we present a simple yet flexible
graph-based neural network architecture that can easily be applied to a wide
range of supervised learning tasks in these domains. We show that our approach
reaches performance close to state-of-the-art dedicated methods on all
datasets. To simplify adaptation for various problems, we provide
easy-to-follow instructions on how graph-based representations of data
structures, relevant for fundamental physics, can be constructed and provide

                                        <span>Motivated by finite volume scheme, a cell-average based neural network method
is proposed. The method is based on the integral or weak formulation of partial
differential equations. A simple feed forward network is forced to learn the
solution average evolution between two neighboring time steps. Offline
supervised training is carried out to obtain the optimal network parameter set,
which uniquely identifies one finite volume like neural network method. Once
well trained, the network method is implemented as a finite volume scheme, thus
is mesh dependent. Different to traditional numerical methods, our method can
be relieved from the explicit scheme CFL restriction and can adapt to any time
step size for solution evolution. For Heat equation, first order of convergence
is observed and the errors are related to the spatial mesh size but are
observed independent of the mesh size in time. The cell-average based neural
network method can sharply evolve contact discontinuity with almost zero
numerical diffusion introduced. Shock and rarefaction waves are well captured
for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.</span>

                                        <span>Active learning has proven to be useful for minimizing labeling costs by
selecting the most informative samples. However, existing active learning
methods do not work well in realistic scenarios such as imbalance or rare
classes, out-of-distribution data in the unlabeled set, and redundancy. In this
work, we propose SIMILAR (Submodular Information Measures based actIve
LeARning), a unified active learning framework using recently proposed
submodular information measures (SIM) as acquisition functions. We argue that
SIMILAR not only works in standard active learning, but also easily extends to
the realistic settings considered above and acts as a one-stop solution for
active learning that is scalable to large real-world datasets. Empirically, we
show that SIMILAR significantly outperforms existing active learning algorithms
by as much as ~5% - 18% in the case of rare classes and ~5% - 10% in the case
of out-of-distribution data on several image classification tasks like
CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet.</span>

and engineering progress. These techniques are applied in contexts as diverse
as astronomy and spam filtering. However, correctly applying these techniques
requires careful engineering. Much attention has been paid to the technical
potential; relatively little attention has been paid to the software
engineering process required to bring research-based machine learning
techniques into practical utility. Technology companies have supported the
engineering community through machine learning frameworks such as TensorFLow
and PyTorch, but the details of how to engineer complex machine learning models
in these frameworks have remained hidden.

To promote best practices within the engineering community, academic
institutions and Google have partnered to launch a Special Interest Group on
Machine Learning Models (SIGMODELS) whose goal is to develop exemplary
implementations of prominent machine learning models in community locations
such as the TensorFlow Model Garden (TFMG). The purpose of this report is to
define a process for reproducing a state-of-the-art machine learning model at a
level of quality suitable for inclusion in the TFMG. We define the engineering
process and elaborate on each step, from paper analysis to model release. We
report on our experiences implementing the YOLO model family with a team of 26
student researchers, share the tools we developed, and describe the lessons we
learned along the way.</span>

Q-learning has received increasing attention. Recently, there have been more
theoretical works on the regret bound of algorithms that belong to the
Q-learning class in different settings. In this paper, we analyze the
cumulative regret when conducting Nash Q-learning algorithm on 2-player
turn-based stochastic Markov games (2-TBSG), and propose the very first gap
dependent logarithmic upper bounds in the episodic tabular setting. This bound
matches the theoretical lower bound only up to a logarithmic term. Furthermore,
we extend the conclusion to the discounted game setting with infinite horizon
and propose a similar gap dependent logarithmic regret bound. Also, under the
linear MDP assumption, we obtain another logarithmic regret for 2-TBSG, in both

algorithms, but also makes it hard for a practitioner to find the right
solution to solve the problem at hand. Typical textbooks on Bandits focus on
designing and analyzing algorithms, and surveys on applications often present a
list of individual applications. While these are valuable resources, there
exists a gap in mapping applications to appropriate Bandit algorithms. In this
paper, we aim to reduce this gap with a structured map of Bandits to help
practitioners navigate to find relevant and practical Bandit algorithms.
Instead of providing a comprehensive overview, we focus on a small number of
key decision points related to reward, action, and features, which often affect
how Bandit algorithms are chosen in practice.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the success of recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods on
various tasks which have shown to output networks that largely outperform
human-designed networks, conventional NAS methods have mostly tackled the
optimization of searching for the network architecture for a single task
(dataset), which does not generalize well across multiple tasks (datasets).
Moreover, since such task-specific methods search for a neural architecture
from scratch for every given task, they incur a large computational cost, which
is problematic when the time and monetary budget are limited. In this paper, we
propose an efficient NAS framework that is trained once on a database
consisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search for a
neural architecture for a novel dataset. The proposed MetaD2A (Meta
Dataset-to-Architecture) model can stochastically generate graphs
(architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a cross-modal latent space
learned with amortized meta-learning. Moreover, we also propose a
meta-performance predictor to estimate and select the best architecture without
direct training on target datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that
our model meta-learned on subsets of ImageNet-1K and architectures from
NAS-Bench 201 search space successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets
including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with an average search time of 33 GPU
seconds. Even under MobileNetV3 search space, MetaD2A is 5.5K times faster than
NSGANetV2, a transferable NAS method, with comparable performance. We believe
that the MetaD2A proposes a new research direction for rapid NAS as well as
ways to utilize the knowledge from rich databases of datasets and architectures
accumulated over the past years. Code is available at

is here exemplified through a toy linear-quadratic model, for which a suitable
form of common noise has already been proven to restore existence and
uniqueness. We here go one step further and prove that the same form of common

dynamics with scale imbalances during training of deep neural networks, such as
Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs are popular machine-learning
templates that allow for seamless integration of physical equation models with
data. Their training amounts to solving an optimization problem over a weighted
sum of data-fidelity and equation-fidelity objectives. Conflicts between
objectives can arise from scale imbalances, heteroscedasticity in the data,
stiffness of the physical equation, or from catastrophic interference during
sequential training. We explain the training pathology arising from this and
propose a simple yet effective inverse-Dirichlet weighting strategy to
alleviate the issue. We compare with Sobolev training of neural networks,
providing the baseline of analytically $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-optimal
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inverse-Dirichlet weighting in
various applications, including a multi-scale model of active turbulence, where
we show orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy and convergence over
conventional PINN training. For inverse modeling using sequential training, we
find that inverse-Dirichlet weighting protects a PINN against catastrophic
forgetting.</span>

other mass media. Due to the accessibility of these platforms, they are often
used to establish a narrative, conduct propaganda, and disseminate
misinformation. This work proposes an approach that uses state-of-the-art NLP
techniques to extract features from video captions (subtitles). To evaluate our
approach, we utilize a publicly accessible and labeled dataset for classifying
videos as misinformation or not. The motivation behind exploring video captions
stems from our analysis of videos metadata. Attributes such as the number of
views, likes, dislikes, and comments are ineffective as videos are hard to
differentiate using this information. Using caption dataset, the proposed
models can classify videos among three classes (Misinformation, Debunking
Misinformation, and Neutral) with 0.85 to 0.90 F1-score. To emphasize the
relevance of the misinformation class, we re-formulate our classification
problem as a two-class classification - Misinformation vs. others (Debunking
Misinformation and Neutral). In our experiments, the proposed models can
classify videos with 0.92 to 0.95 F1-score and 0.78 to 0.90 AUC ROC.</span>

sentence representation. However, the previous Transformer-based models focus
on function words that have limited meaning in most cases and could merely
extract high-level semantic abstraction features. In this paper, two approaches
are introduced to improve the performance of Transformers. We calculated the
attention score by multiplying the part-of-speech weight vector with the
correlation coefficient, which helps extract the words with more practical
meaning. The weight vector is obtained by the input text sequence based on the
importance of the part-of-speech. Furthermore, we fuse the features of each
layer to make the sentence representation results more comprehensive and
accurate. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model
Transformer-F on three standard text classification datasets. Experimental
results show that our proposed model significantly boosts the performance of
text classification as compared to the baseline model. Specifically, we obtain
a 5.28% relative improvement over the vanilla Transformer on the simple tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Greedy decision tree learning heuristics are mainstays of machine learning
practice, but theoretical justification for their empirical success remains
elusive. In fact, it has long been known that there are simple target functions
for which they fail badly (Kearns and Mansour, STOC 1996).

Recent work of Brutzkus, Daniely, and Malach (COLT 2020) considered the
smoothed analysis model as a possible avenue towards resolving this disconnect.
Within the smoothed setting and for targets $f$ that are $k$-juntas, they
showed that these heuristics successfully learn $f$ with depth-$k$ decision
tree hypotheses. They conjectured that the same guarantee holds more generally
for targets that are depth-$k$ decision trees.

We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: we construct targets that are
depth-$k$ decision trees and show that even in the smoothed setting, these
heuristics build trees of depth $2^{\Omega(k)}$ before achieving high accuracy.
We also show that the guarantees of Brutzkus et al. cannot extend to the
agnostic setting: there are targets that are very close to $k$-juntas, for
which these heuristics build trees of depth $2^{\Omega(k)}$ before achieving
high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>One of the central elements of any causal inference is an object called
structural causal model (SCM), which represents a collection of mechanisms and
exogenous sources of random variation of the system under investigation (Pearl,
2000). An important property of many kinds of neural networks is universal
approximability: the ability to approximate any function to arbitrary
precision. Given this property, one may be tempted to surmise that a collection
of neural nets is capable of learning any SCM by training on data generated by
that SCM. In this paper, we show this is not the case by disentangling the
notions of expressivity and learnability. Specifically, we show that the causal
hierarchy theorem (Thm. 1, Bareinboim et al., 2020), which describes the limits
of what can be learned from data, still holds for neural models. For instance,
an arbitrarily complex and expressive neural net is unable to predict the
effects of interventions given observational data alone. Given this result, we
introduce a special type of SCM called a neural causal model (NCM), and
formalize a new type of inductive bias to encode structural constraints
necessary for performing causal inferences. Building on this new class of
models, we focus on solving two canonical tasks found in the literature known
as causal identification and estimation. Leveraging the neural toolbox, we
develop an algorithm that is both sufficient and necessary to determine whether
a causal effect can be learned from data (i.e., causal identifiability); it
then estimates the effect whenever identifiability holds (causal estimation).
Simulations corroborate the proposed approach.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning is promising for its ability to collaboratively train
models with multiple clients without accessing their data, but vulnerable when
clients&#x27; data distributions diverge from each other. This divergence further
leads to a dilemma: &quot;Should we prioritize the learned model&#x27;s generic
performance (for future use at the server) or its personalized performance (for
each client)?&quot; These two, seemingly competing goals have divided the community
to focus on one or the other, yet in this paper we show that it is possible to
approach both at the same time. Concretely, we propose a novel federated
learning framework that explicitly decouples a model&#x27;s dual duties with two
prediction tasks. On the one hand, we introduce a family of losses that are
robust to non-identical class distributions, enabling clients to train a
generic predictor with a consistent objective across them. On the other hand,
we formulate the personalized predictor as a lightweight adaptive module that
is learned to minimize each client&#x27;s empirical risk on top of the generic
predictor. With this two-loss, two-predictor framework which we name Federated
Robust Decoupling Fed-RoD, the learned model can simultaneously achieve
state-of-the-art generic and personalized performance, essentially bridging the
two tasks.</span>

                                        <span>While pretrained language models achieve excellent performance on natural
language understanding benchmarks, they tend to rely on spurious correlations
and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recent work has
explored using counterfactually-augmented data (CAD) -- data generated by
minimally perturbing examples to flip the ground-truth label -- to identify
robust features that are invariant under distribution shift. However, empirical
results using CAD for OOD generalization have been mixed. To explain this
discrepancy, we draw insights from a linear Gaussian model and demonstrate the
pitfalls of CAD. Specifically, we show that (a) while CAD is effective at
identifying robust features, it may prevent the model from learning unperturbed
robust features, and (b) CAD may exacerbate existing spurious correlations in
the data. Our results show that the lack of perturbation diversity in current
CAD datasets limits its effectiveness on OOD generalization, calling for
innovative crowdsourcing procedures to elicit diverse perturbation of examples.</span>

employing machine learning techniques. Mixed Integer Programming is a general
technique for formulating combinatorial optimization problems. Inside a solver,
primal heuristics play a critical role in finding good feasible solutions that
enable one to tighten the duality gap from the outset of the Branch-and-Bound
algorithm (B&amp;B), greatly improving its performance by pruning the B&amp;B tree
aggressively. In this paper, we investigate whether effective primal heuristics
can be automatically learned via machine learning. We propose a new method to
represent an optimization problem as a graph, and train a Graph Convolutional
Network on solved problem instances with known optimal solutions. This in turn
can predict the values of decision variables in the optimal solution for an
unseen problem instance of a similar type. The prediction of variable solutions
is then leveraged by a novel configuration of the B&amp;B method, Probabilistic
Branching with guided Depth-first Search (PB-DFS) approach, aiming to find
(near-)optimal solutions quickly. The experimental results show that this new
heuristic can find better primal solutions at a much earlier stage of the
solving process, compared to other state-of-the-art primal heuristics.</span>

degradation due to accented speech, especially unfamiliar accents. In this
paper, we study the supervised contrastive learning framework for accented
speech recognition. To build different views (similar &quot;positive&quot; data samples)
for contrastive learning, three data augmentation techniques including noise
injection, spectrogram augmentation and TTS-same-sentence generation are
further investigated. From the experiments on the Common Voice dataset, we have
shown that contrastive learning helps to build data-augmentation invariant and
pronunciation invariant representations, which significantly outperforms
traditional joint training methods in both zero-shot and full-shot settings.

for time-varying signals is introduced. The proposed scheme, referred to as
RL-NCS, aims to boost the performance of signal recovery through an optimal and
adaptive distribution of sensing energy among two groups of coefficients of the
signal, referred to as the region of interest (ROI) coefficients and non-ROI
coefficients. The coefficients in ROI usually have greater importance and need
to be reconstructed with higher accuracy compared to non-ROI coefficients. In
order to accomplish this task, the ROI is predicted at each time step using two
specific approaches. One of these approaches incorporates a long short-term
memory (LSTM) network for the prediction. The other approach employs the
previous ROI information for predicting the next step ROI. Using the
exploration-exploitation technique, a Q-network learns to choose the best
approach for designing the measurement matrix. Furthermore, a joint loss
function is introduced for the efficient training of the Q-network as well as
the LSTM network. The result indicates a significant performance gain for our
proposed method, even for rapidly varying signals and a reduced number of
measurements.</span>

delusional psychosis, often with destructive consequences for those affected
and their surroundings. Early detection and intervention of a manic episode are
crucial to prevent escalation, hospital admission and premature death. However,
people with bipolar disorder may not recognize that they are experiencing a
manic episode and symptoms such as euphoria and increased productivity can also
deter affected individuals from seeking help. This work proposes to perform
user-independent, automatic mood-state detection based on actigraphy and
electrodermal activity acquired from a wrist-worn device during mania and after
recovery (euthymia). This paper proposes a new deep learning-based ensemble
method leveraging long (20h) and short (5 minutes) time-intervals to
discriminate between the mood-states. When tested on 47 bipolar patients, the
proposed classification scheme achieves an average accuracy of 91.59% in

                                        <span>The ratio of two probability densities, called a density-ratio, is a vital
quantity in machine learning. In particular, a relative density-ratio, which is
a bounded extension of the density-ratio, has received much attention due to
its stability and has been used in various applications such as outlier
detection and dataset comparison. Existing methods for (relative) density-ratio
estimation (DRE) require many instances from both densities. However,
sufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. In this paper, we
propose a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative
density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets.
Specifically, given two datasets that consist of a few instances, our model
extracts the datasets&#x27; information by using neural networks and uses it to
obtain instance embeddings appropriate for the relative DRE. We model the
relative density-ratio by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global
optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution. The closed-form
solution enables fast and effective adaptation to a few instances, and its
differentiability enables us to train our model such that the expected test
error for relative DRE can be explicitly minimized after adapting to a few
instances. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
by using three problems: relative DRE, dataset comparison, and outlier
detection.</span>

sequence of intermediate densities between two distributions of interest
constructed using the geometric average. While alternatives such as the
moment-averaging path have demonstrated performance gains in some settings,
their practical applicability remains limited by exponential family endpoint
assumptions and a lack of closed form energy function. In this work, we
introduce $q$-paths, a family of paths which is derived from a generalized
notion of the mean, includes the geometric and arithmetic mixtures as special
cases, and admits a simple closed form involving the deformed logarithm
function from nonextensive thermodynamics. Following previous analysis of the
geometric path, we interpret our $q$-paths as corresponding to a
$q$-exponential family of distributions, and provide a variational
representation of intermediate densities as minimizing a mixture of
$\alpha$-divergences to the endpoints. We show that small deviations away from
the geometric path yield empirical gains for Bayesian inference using
Sequential Monte Carlo and generative model evaluation using Annealed
Importance Sampling.</span>

Our model consists of a feature selector and decoder. The feature selector
outputs a subset of relevant features taking a few unlabeled instances as input
such that the decoder can reconstruct the original features of unseen instances
from the selected ones. The feature selector uses the Concrete random variables
to select features via gradient descent. To encode task-specific properties
from a few unlabeled instances to the model, the Concrete random variables and
decoder are modeled using permutation-invariant neural networks that take a few
unlabeled instances as input. Our model is trained by minimizing the expected
test reconstruction error given a few unlabeled instances that is calculated
with datasets in source tasks. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing feature selection methods.</span>

                                        <span>Inter-beat interval (IBI) measurement enables estimation of heart-rate
variability (HRV) which, in turns, can provide early indication of potential
cardiovascular diseases. However, extracting IBIs from noisy signals is
challenging since the morphology of the signal is distorted in the presence of
the noise. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of a person in heavy motion is highly
corrupted with noise, known as motion-artifact, and IBI extracted from it is
inaccurate. As a part of remote health monitoring and wearable system
development, denoising ECG signals and estimating IBIs correctly from them have
become an emerging topic among signal-processing researchers. Apart from
conventional methods, deep-learning techniques have been successfully used in
signal denoising recently, and diagnosis process has become easier, leading to
accuracy levels that were previously unachievable. We propose a deep-learning
approach leveraging tiramisu autoencoder model to suppress motion-artifact
noise and make the R-peaks of the ECG signal prominent even in the presence of
high-intensity motion. After denoising, IBIs are estimated more accurately
expediting diagnosis tasks. Results illustrate that our method enables IBI
estimation from noisy ECG signals with SNR up to -30dB with average root mean
square error (RMSE) of 13 milliseconds for estimated IBIs. At this noise level,
our error percentage remains below 8% and outperforms other state of the art
techniques.</span>

systems determine the availability of content and users&#x27; opportunities for
discovery. We propose an evaluation procedure based on stochastic reachability
to quantify the maximum probability of recommending a target piece of content
to an user for a set of allowable strategic modifications. This framework
allows us to compute an upper bound on the likelihood of recommendation with
minimal assumptions about user behavior. Stochastic reachability can be used to
detect biases in the availability of content and diagnose limitations in the
opportunities for discovery granted to users. We show that this metric can be
computed efficiently as a convex program for a variety of practical settings,
and further argue that reachability is not inherently at odds with accuracy. We
demonstrate evaluations of recommendation algorithms trained on large datasets
of explicit and implicit ratings. Our results illustrate how preference models,
selection rules, and user interventions impact reachability and how these

are increasingly demanded in different workspaces. A classifier model assessing
the quality of actions can predict the successful completion of a task, which
can be used by intelligent agents for action-selection. This paper presents a
novel classifier that learns to classify task completion only from a few
demonstrations. We carry out a comprehensive comparison of different neural
classifiers, e.g. fully connected-based, fully convolutional-based,
sequence2sequence-based, and domain adaptation-based classification. We also
present a new dataset including five robot manipulation tasks, which is
publicly available. We compared the performances of our novel classifier and
the existing models using our dataset and the MIME dataset. The results suggest
domain adaptation and timing-based features improve success prediction. Our
novel model, i.e. fully convolutional neural network with domain adaptation and
timing features, achieves an average classification accuracy of 97.3\% and
95.5\% across tasks in both datasets whereas state-of-the-art classifiers
without domain adaptation and timing-features only achieve 82.4\% and 90.3\%,

can use in almost any domain. However, recent studies often lack the

reward shaping, curriculum learning, and splitting a large task into smaller

an individual can borrow a bike and returns it everywhere, within the service
area. To improve the rental service, available bikes should be distributed over
the entire service area: a customer leaving from any position is then more
likely to find a near bike and then to use the service. Moreover, spreading
bikes among the entire service area increases urban spatial equity since the
benefits of FFBSS are not a prerogative of just a few zones. For guaranteeing
such distribution, the FFBSS operator can use vans to manually relocate bikes,
but it incurs high economic and environmental costs. We propose a novel
approach that exploits the existing bike flows generated by customers to
distribute bikes. More specifically, by envisioning the problem as an Influence
Maximization problem, we show that it is possible to position batches of bikes
on a small number of zones, and then the daily use of FFBSS will efficiently
spread these bikes on a large area. We show that detecting these areas is
NP-complete, but there exists a simple and efficient $1-1/e$ approximation
algorithm; our approach is then evaluated on a dataset of rides from the

                                        <span>Recently, due to an increasing interest for transparency in artificial
intelligence, several methods of explainable machine learning have been
developed with the simultaneous goal of accuracy and interpretability by
humans. In this paper, we study a recent framework of explainable clustering
first suggested by Dasgupta et al.~\cite{dasgupta2020explainable}.
Specifically, we focus on the $k$-means and $k$-medians problems and provide
nearly tight upper and lower bounds.

First, we provide an $O(\log k \log \log k)$-approximation algorithm for
explainable $k$-medians, improving on the best known algorithm of
$O(k)$~\cite{dasgupta2020explainable} and nearly matching the known
$\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound~\cite{dasgupta2020explainable}. In addition, in
low-dimensional spaces $d \ll \log k$, we show that our algorithm also provides
an $O(d \log^2 d)$-approximate solution for explainable $k$-medians. This
improves over the best known bound of $O(d \log k)$ for low
dimensions~\cite{laber2021explainable}, and is a constant for constant
dimensional spaces. To complement this, we show a nearly matching $\Omega(d)$
lower bound. Next, we study the $k$-means problem in this context and provide
an $O(k \log k)$-approximation algorithm for explainable $k$-means, improving
over the $O(k^2)$ bound of Dasgupta et al. and the $O(d k \log k)$ bound of
\cite{laber2021explainable}. To complement this we provide an almost tight
$\Omega(k)$ lower bound, improving over the $\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound of
Dasgupta et al. All our algorithms run in near linear time in the number of
points and the dimension.</span>

market prediction is a difficult task to handle. In this study, we propose a
novel method that is based on deep reinforcement learning methodologies for the
direction prediction of stocks using sentiments of community and knowledge
graph. For this purpose, we firstly construct a social knowledge graph of users

methodology. Turkish version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from

deep Q-learning methodology is used for the deep reinforcement learning side of

                                        <span>In pursuit of explainability, we develop generative models for sequential
data. The proposed models provide state-of-the-art classification results and
robust performance for speech phone classification. We combine modern neural
networks (normalizing flows) and traditional generative models (hidden Markov
models - HMMs). Normalizing flow-based mixture models (NMMs) are used to model
the conditional probability distribution given the hidden state in the HMMs.
Model parameters are learned through judicious combinations of time-tested
Bayesian learning methods and contemporary neural network learning methods. We
mainly combine expectation-maximization (EM) and mini-batch gradient descent.
The proposed generative models can compute likelihood of a data and hence
directly suitable for maximum-likelihood (ML) classification approach. Due to
structural flexibility of HMMs, we can use different normalizing flow models.
This leads to different types of HMMs providing diversity in data modeling
capacity. The diversity provides an opportunity for easy decision fusion from
different models. For a standard speech phone classification setup involving 39
phones (classes) and the TIMIT dataset, we show that the use of standard
features called mel-frequency-cepstral-coeffcients (MFCCs), the proposed
generative models, and the decision fusion together can achieve $86.6\%$
accuracy by generative training only. This result is close to state-of-the-art
results, for examples, $86.2\%$ accuracy of PyTorch-Kaldi toolkit [1], and
$85.1\%$ accuracy using light gated recurrent units [2]. We do not use any
discriminative learning approach and related sophisticated features in this

generative models are a promising new approach for configuration generation in
lattice field theory. In this paper, we present a set of methods to construct
flow models for targets with multiple separated modes (i.e. theories with
multiple vacua). We demonstrate the application of these methods to modeling
two-dimensional real scalar field theory in its symmetry-broken phase. In this

are occasionally augmented by applying updates using traditional algorithms

visual block containing a pretrained 2D-CNN followed by a temporal
convolutional network (TCN); (2) an aural block containing several parallel
TCNs; and (3) a leader-follower attentive fusion block combining the
audio-visual information. The TCN with large history coverage enables our model
to exploit spatial-temporal information within a much larger window length
(i.e., 300) than that from the baseline and state-of-the-art methods (i.e., 36
or 48). The fusion block emphasizes the visual modality while exploits the
noisy aural modality using the inter-modality attention mechanism. To make full
use of the data and alleviate over-fitting, cross-validation is carried out on
the training and validation set. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)
centering is used to merge the results from each fold. On the development set,
the achieved CCC is 0.410 for valence and 0.661 for arousal, which
significantly outperforms the baseline method with the corresponding CCC of
0.210 and 0.230 for valence and arousal, respectively. The code is available at

capture audience attention, such as Instagram stories, Facebook Instant
articles, and YouTube videos. In some cases, these formats are created in
collaboration with the tech companies themselves. At the same time, the use of
data-driven storytelling is becoming increasingly integrated into the
ever-complex business models of news outlets, generating more impact and
visibility. Previous studies have focused on studying these two effects
separately. To address this gap in the literature, this paper identifies and
analyzes the use of data journalism on the Instagram content of AJ Labs, the
team dedicated to producing data-driven and interactive stories for the Al
Jazeera news network. Drawing upon a mixed-method approach, this study examines
the use and characteristics of data stories on social media platforms. Results
suggest that there is reliance on producing visual content that covers topics
such as politics and violence. In general, AJ Labs relies on the use of
infographics and produces its own unique data. To conclude, this paper suggests
potential ways to improve the use of Instagram to tell data stories.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, automatic speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation
has gained momentum thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, especially
in the domains of speech recognition and machine translation. The quality of
such applications is commonly tested with automatic metrics, such as BLEU,
primarily with the goal of assessing improvements of releases or in the context
of evaluation campaigns. However, little is known about how the output of such
systems is perceived by end users or how they compare to human performances in
similar communicative tasks.

In this paper, we present the results of an experiment aimed at evaluating
the quality of a real-time speech translation engine by comparing it to the
performance of professional simultaneous interpreters. To do so, we adopt a
framework developed for the assessment of human interpreters and use it to
perform a manual evaluation on both human and machine performances. In our
sample, we found better performance for the human interpreters in terms of
intelligibility, while the machine performs slightly better in terms of
informativeness. The limitations of the study and the possible enhancements of
the chosen framework are discussed. Despite its intrinsic limitations, the use
of this framework represents a first step towards a user-centric and
communication-oriented methodology for evaluating real-time automatic speech
translation.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment quantification is the task of estimating the relative frequency (or
&quot;prevalence&quot;) of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral,
Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts; this is especially important when
these texts are tweets, since most sentiment classification endeavours carried
out on Twitter data actually have quantification (and not the classification of
individual tweets) as their ultimate goal. It is well-known that solving
quantification via &quot;classify and count&quot; (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled
items via a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned
to a given class) is suboptimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate
quantification methods exist. In 2016, Gao and Sebastiani carried out a
systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment
quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimental protocol
followed in that work is flawed, and that its results are thus unreliable. We
now re-evaluate those quantification methods on the very same datasets, this
time following a now consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol,
that involves 5775 as many experiments as run in the original study. Our
experimentation yields results dramatically different from those obtained by
Gao and Sebastiani, and thus provide a different, much more solid understanding
of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.</span>

development of effective text mining models across various biomedical tasks.
However, these models are primarily learned on the textual data and often lack
the domain knowledge of the entities to capture the context beyond the
sentence. In this study, we introduced a novel framework that enables the model
to learn multi-omnics biological information about entities (proteins) with the
help of additional multi-modal cues like molecular structure. Towards this,
rather developing modality-specific architectures, we devise a generalized and
optimized graph based multi-modal learning mechanism that utilizes the
GraphBERT model to encode the textual and molecular structure information and
exploit the underlying features of various modalities to enable end-to-end
learning. We evaluated our proposed method on ProteinProtein Interaction task
from the biomedical corpus, where our proposed generalized approach is observed
to be benefited by the additional domain-specific modality.</span>

inter-operate. Such an analysis is important for better model understanding,
debugging and to ensure fairness in ethical decision making. In this work, we
analyze the representations trained within deep speech models, towards the task
of speaker recognition, dialect identification and reconstruction of masked
signals. We carry a layer- and neuron-level analysis on the utterance-level
representations captured within pretrained speech models for speaker, language
and channel properties. We study: is this information captured in the learned
representations? where is it preserved? how is it distributed? and can we
identify a minimal subset of network that posses this information. Using
diagnostic classifiers, we answered these questions. Our results reveal: (i)
channel and gender information is omnipresent and is redundantly distributed
(ii) complex properties such as dialectal information is encoded only in the
task-oriented pretrained network and is localised in the upper layers (iii) a
minimal subset of neurons can be extracted to encode the predefined property
(iv) salient neurons are sometimes shared between properties and can highlights
presence of biases in the network. Our cross-architectural comparison indicates
that (v) the pretrained models captures speaker-invariant information and (vi)
the pretrained CNNs models are competitive to the Transformers for encoding
information for the studied properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to investigate neuron analysis on the speech models.</span>

models and have been shown to improve the prediction performance, it has been
reported to be vulnerable to perturbations to the mechanism. To overcome the
vulnerability to perturbations in the mechanism, we are inspired by adversarial
training (AT), which is a powerful regularization technique for enhancing the
robustness of the models. In this paper, we propose a general training
technique for natural language processing tasks, including AT for attention
(Attention AT) and more interpretable AT for attention (Attention iAT). The
proposed techniques improved the prediction performance and the model
interpretability by exploiting the mechanisms with AT. In particular, Attention
iAT boosts those advantages by introducing adversarial perturbation, which
enhances the difference in the attention of the sentences. Evaluation
experiments with ten open datasets revealed that AT for attention mechanisms,
especially Attention iAT, demonstrated (1) the best performance in nine out of
ten tasks and (2) more interpretable attention (i.e., the resulting attention
correlated more strongly with gradient-based word importance) for all tasks.
Additionally, the proposed techniques are (3) much less dependent on
perturbation size in AT. Our code is available at

extended to the online variants for streaming automatic speech recognition
(ASR), such as monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA), the models still have a
large label emission latency because of the unconstrained end-to-end training
objective. Previous works tackled this problem by leveraging alignment
information to control the timing to emit tokens during training. In this work,
we propose a simple alignment-free regularization method, StableEmit, to
encourage MoChA to emit tokens earlier. StableEmit discounts the selection
probabilities in hard monotonic attention for token boundary detection by a
constant factor and regularizes them to recover the total attention mass during
training. As a result, the scale of the selection probabilities is increased,
and the values can reach a threshold for token emission earlier, leading to a
reduction of emission latency and deletion errors. Moreover, StableEmit can be
combined with methods that constraint alignments to further improve the
accuracy and latency. Experimental evaluations with LSTM and Conformer encoders
demonstrate that StableEmit significantly reduces the recognition errors and
the emission latency simultaneously. We also show that the use of alignment
information is complementary in both metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Self-attention (SA), which encodes vector sequences according to their
pairwise similarity, is widely used in speech recognition due to its strong
context modeling ability. However, when applied to long sequence data, its
accuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average
operator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which
results in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this
issue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention
(RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of
self-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the
local window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different
test data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window
length is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further
generalize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the
performance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based
speech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin
speech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate
(CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the
SA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is
only slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to
tune the window length manually.</span>

operations, called keys. The corresponding language is the set of words
obtained by applying some sequence of those keys. Unlike classical models of
computation, every key can be applied anytime. We define various classes of
languages based on different sets of elementary operations, and compare their
expressive powers. We also compare them to well-known classes of languages
(Chomsky hierarchy). We obtain a strict hierarchy of languages, whose

event-related tasks, but they typically do not capture the temporal
relationships between events. We propose a single model that addresses both
temporal ordering, sorting given events into the order they occurred, and event
infilling, predicting new events which fit into an existing temporally-ordered
sequence. We use a BART-based conditional generation model that can capture
both temporality and common event co-occurrence, meaning it can be flexibly
applied to different tasks in this space. Our model is trained as a denoising
autoencoder: we take temporally-ordered event sequences, shuffle them, delete
some events, and then attempt to recover the original event sequence. This task
teaches the model to make inferences given incomplete knowledge about the
events in an underlying scenario. On the temporal ordering task, we show that
our model is able to unscramble event sequences from existing datasets without
access to explicitly labeled temporal training data, outperforming both a
BERT-based pairwise model and a BERT-based pointer network. On event infilling,
human evaluation shows that our model is able to generate events that fit
better temporally into the input events when compared to GPT-2 story completion

                                        <span>Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental research task in digital text
forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the
same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that
focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first
category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features,
where one has full control over which features are considered and what they
actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV
methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control
mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a
potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear
the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions,
which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To
tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise,
which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV
methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the
writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into
the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better
results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases,
with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%.</span>

                                        <span>Training the large deep neural networks that dominate NLP requires large
datasets. Many of these are collected automatically or via crowdsourcing, and
may exhibit systematic biases or annotation artifacts. By the latter, we mean
correlations between inputs and outputs that are spurious, insofar as they do
not represent a generally held causal relationship between features and
classes; models that exploit such correlations may appear to perform a given
task well, but fail on out of sample data. In this paper we propose methods to
facilitate identification of training data artifacts, using new hybrid
approaches that combine saliency maps (which highlight important input
features) with instance attribution methods (which retrieve training samples
influential to a given prediction). We show that this proposed training-feature
attribution approach can be used to uncover artifacts in training data, and use
it to identify previously unreported artifacts in a few standard NLP datasets.
We execute a small user study to evaluate whether these methods are useful to
NLP researchers in practice, with promising results. We make code for all
methods and experiments in this paper available.</span>

                                        <span>Information Extraction (IE) for semi-structured document images is often
approached as a sequence tagging problem by classifying each recognized input
token into one of the IOB (Inside, Outside, and Beginning) categories. However,
such problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it cannot easily
handle complex spatial relationships and (2) it is not suitable for highly
structured information, which are nevertheless frequently observed in
real-world document images. To tackle these issues, we first formulate the IE
task as spatial dependency parsing problem that focuses on the relationship
among text tokens in the documents. Under this setup, we then propose SPADE
(SPAtial DEpendency parser) that models highly complex spatial relationships
and an arbitrary number of information layers in the documents in an end-to-end
manner. We evaluate it on various kinds of documents such as receipts, name
cards, forms, and invoices, and show that it achieves a similar or better
performance compared to strong baselines including BERT-based IOB taggger.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce the GANformer, a novel and efficient type of transformer, and
explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image,
while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to
high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of
latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the
refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of
compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic
transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows
flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of
the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model&#x27;s strength and
robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from
simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor
scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality
and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further
qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model&#x27;s
inner workings, revealing improved interpretability and stronger
disentanglement, and illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach. An
implementation of the model is available at

high-quality semantic representations, these models are still vulnerable to
simple perturbations. Recent works aimed to improve the robustness of
pre-trained models mainly focus on adversarial training from perturbed examples
with similar semantics, neglecting the utilization of different or even
opposite semantics. Different from the image processing field, the text is
discrete and few word substitutions can cause significant semantic changes. To
study the impact of semantics caused by small perturbations, we conduct a
series of pilot experiments and surprisingly find that adversarial training is
useless or even harmful for the model to detect these semantic changes. To
address this problem, we propose Contrastive Learning with semantIc Negative
Examples (CLINE), which constructs semantic negative examples unsupervised to
improve the robustness under semantically adversarial attacking. By comparing
with similar and opposite semantic examples, the model can effectively perceive
the semantic changes caused by small perturbations. Empirical results show that
our approach yields substantial improvements on a range of sentiment analysis,
reasoning, and reading comprehension tasks. And CLINE also ensures the
compactness within the same semantics and separability across different
semantics in sentence-level.</span>

translating between language pairs unseen in training, i.e. zero-shot
translation. Despite being conceptually attractive, it often suffers from low
output quality. The difficulty of generalizing to new translation directions
suggests the model representations are highly specific to those language pairs
seen in training. We demonstrate that a main factor causing the
language-specific representations is the positional correspondence to input
tokens. We show that this can be easily alleviated by removing residual
connections in an encoder layer. With this modification, we gain up to 18.5
BLEU points on zero-shot translation while retaining quality on supervised
directions. The improvements are particularly prominent between related
languages, where our proposed model outperforms pivot-based translation.
Moreover, our approach allows easy integration of new languages, which
substantially expands translation coverage. By thorough inspections of the
hidden layer outputs, we show that our approach indeed leads to more
language-independent representations.</span>

data, architecture, and audio segmentation. On the data side, we investigated
sequence-level knowledge distillation (SeqKD) for end-to-end (E2E) speech
translation. Specifically, we used multi-referenced SeqKD from multiple
teachers trained on different amounts of bitext. On the architecture side, we
adopted the Conformer encoder and the Multi-Decoder architecture, which equips
dedicated decoders for speech recognition and translation tasks in a unified
encoder-decoder model and enables search in both source and target language
spaces during inference. We also significantly improved audio segmentation by
using the pyannote.audio toolkit and merging multiple short segments for long
context modeling. Experimental evaluations showed that each of them contributed
to large improvements in translation performance. Our best E2E system combined
all the above techniques with model ensembling and achieved 31.4 BLEU on the

                                        <span>Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an active field in natural language
processing with many successful developed models in recent years. Despite their
high in-distribution accuracy, these models suffer from two issues: high
training cost and low out-of-distribution accuracy. Even though some approaches
have been presented to tackle the generalization problem, they have high,
intolerable training costs. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
ensemble learning approach to improve generalization of MRC systems without
retraining a big model. After separately training the base models with
different structures on different datasets, they are ensembled using weighting
and stacking approaches in probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings. Three
configurations are investigated including heterogeneous, homogeneous, and
hybrid on eight datasets and six state-of-the-art models. We identify the
important factors in the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Also, we compare
the robustness of ensemble and fine-tuned models against data distribution
shifts. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the
ensemble approach in improving the out-of-distribution accuracy of MRC systems,
especially when the base models are similar in accuracies.</span>

                                        <span>Previous works indicate that the glyph of Chinese characters contains rich
semantic information and has the potential to enhance the representation of
Chinese characters. The typical method to utilize the glyph features is by
incorporating them into the character embedding space. Inspired by previous
methods, we innovatively propose a Chinese pre-trained representation model
named as GlyphCRM, which abandons the ID-based character embedding method yet
solely based on sequential character images. We render each character into a
binary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it.
Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network,
namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese
characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer
blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information.
Meanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph
module into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to
fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module
can obtain a sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the
long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. Extensive
experimental results indicate that GlyphCRM substantially outperforms the
previous BERT-based state-of-the-art model on 9 fine-tuning tasks, and it has
strong transferability and generalization on specialized fields and
low-resource tasks. We hope this work could spark further research beyond the
realms of well-established representation of Chinese texts.</span>

                                        <span>Placeholder translation systems enable the users to specify how a specific
phrase is translated in the output sentence. The system is trained to output
special placeholder tokens, and the user-specified term is injected into the
output through the context-free replacement of the placeholder token. However,
this approach could result in ungrammatical sentences because it is often the
case that the specified term needs to be inflected according to the context of
the output, which is unknown before the translation. To address this problem,
we propose a novel method of placeholder translation that can inflect specified
terms according to the grammatical construction of the output sentence. We
extend the sequence-to-sequence architecture with a character-level decoder
that takes the lemma of a user-specified term and the words generated from the
word-level decoder to output the correct inflected form of the lemma. We
evaluate our approach with a Japanese-to-English translation task in the
scientific writing domain, and show that our model can incorporate specified
terms in the correct form more successfully than other comparable models.</span>

                                        <span>Citation context analysis (CCA) is an important task in natural language
processing that studies how and why scholars discuss each others&#x27; work. Despite
being studied for decades, traditional frameworks for CCA have largely relied
on overly-simplistic assumptions of how authors cite, which ignore several
important phenomena. For instance, scholarly papers often contain rich
discussions of cited work that span multiple sentences and express multiple
intents concurrently. Yet, CCA is typically approached as a single-sentence,
single-label classification task, and thus existing datasets fail to capture
this interesting discourse. In our work, we address this research gap by
proposing a novel framework for CCA as a document-level context extraction and
labeling task. We release MultiCite, a new dataset of 12,653 citation contexts
from over 1,200 computational linguistics papers. Not only is it the largest
collection of expert-annotated citation contexts to-date, MultiCite contains
multi-sentence, multi-label citation contexts within full paper texts. Finally,
we demonstrate how our dataset, while still usable for training classic CCA
models, also supports the development of new types of models for CCA beyond
fixed-width text classification. We release our code and dataset at

argumentation remains challenging. The primary reason lies in the inherent
complexity of the human processes behind, which commonly requires the
integration of extensive knowledge far beyond what is needed for many other
natural language understanding tasks. Existing work on the mining, assessment,
reasoning, and generation of arguments acknowledges this issue, calling for
more research on the integration of common sense and world knowledge into
computational models. However, a systematic effort to collect and organize the
types of knowledge needed is still missing, hindering targeted progress in the
field. In this opinionated survey paper, we address the issue by (1) proposing
a pyramid of types of knowledge required in computational argumentation, (2)
briefly discussing the state of the art on the role and integration of these

                                        <span>Quality Estimation (QE) is the task of automatically predicting Machine
Translation quality in the absence of reference translations, making it
applicable in real-time settings, such as translating online social media
conversations. Recent success in QE stems from the use of multilingual
pre-trained representations, where very large models lead to impressive
results. However, the inference time, disk and memory requirements of such
models do not allow for wide usage in the real world. Models trained on
distilled pre-trained representations remain prohibitively large for many usage
scenarios. We instead propose to directly transfer knowledge from a strong QE
teacher model to a much smaller model with a different, shallower architecture.
We show that this approach, in combination with data augmentation, leads to
light-weight QE models that perform competitively with distilled pre-trained
representations with 8x fewer parameters.</span>

robust event argument extraction (EAE). However, existing efforts in this
direction suffer from two limitations: 1) The argument role type information of
contextual entities is mainly utilized as training signals, ignoring the
potential merits of directly adopting it as semantically rich input features;
2) The argument-level sequential semantics, which implies the overall
distribution pattern of argument roles over an event mention, is not well
characterized. To tackle the above two bottlenecks, we formalize EAE as a
Seq2Seq-like learning problem for the first time, where a sentence with a
specific event trigger is mapped to a sequence of event argument roles. A
neural architecture with a novel Bi-directional Entity-level Recurrent Decoder
(BERD) is proposed to generate argument roles by incorporating contextual
entities&#x27; argument role predictions, like a word-by-word text generation
process, thereby distinguishing implicit argument distribution patterns within
an event more accurately.</span>

within a sentence gives clues to the inference of the zero pronoun. In this
study, we propose a data augmentation method that provides additional training
signals for the translation model to learn correlations between local context
and zero pronouns. We show that the proposed method significantly improves the
accuracy of zero pronoun translation with machine translation experiments in
the conversational domain.</span>

                                        <span>Spoken dialogue systems such as Siri and Alexa provide great convenience to
people&#x27;s everyday life. However, current spoken language understanding (SLU)
pipelines largely depend on automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules, which
require a large amount of language-specific training data. In this paper, we
propose a Transformer-based SLU system that works directly on phones. This
acoustic-based SLU system consists of only two blocks and does not require the
presence of ASR module. The first block is a universal phone recognition
system, and the second block is a Transformer-based language model for phones.
We verify the effectiveness of the system on an intent classification dataset
in Mandarin Chinese.</span>

Speech Translation task. We proposed a novel simultaneous translation model,
Cross Attention Augmented Transducer (CAAT), which extends conventional RNN-T
to sequence-to-sequence tasks without monotonic constraints, e.g., simultaneous
translation. Experiments on speech-to-text (S2T) and text-to-text (T2T)
simultaneous translation tasks shows CAAT achieves better quality-latency
trade-offs compared to \textit{wait-k}, one of the previous state-of-the-art
approaches. Based on CAAT architecture and data augmentation, we build S2T and
T2T simultaneous translation systems in this evaluation campaign. Compared to
last year&#x27;s optimal systems, our S2T simultaneous translation system improves
by an average of 11.3 BLEU for all latency regimes, and our T2T simultaneous
translation system improves by an average of 4.6 BLEU.</span>

                                        <span>Standard NLP tasks do not incorporate several common real-world scenarios
such as seeking clarifications about the question, taking advantage of clues,
abstaining in order to avoid incorrect answers, etc. This difference in task
formulation hinders the adoption of NLP systems in real-world settings. In this
work, we take a step towards bridging this gap and present a multi-stage task
that simulates a typical human-human questioner-responder interaction such as
an interview. Specifically, the system is provided with question
simplifications, knowledge statements, examples, etc. at various stages to
improve its prediction when it is not sufficiently confident. We instantiate
the proposed task in Natural Language Inference setting where a system is
evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and find that the multi-stage formulation of our task
leads to OOD generalization performance improvement up to 2.29% in Stage 1,
1.91% in Stage 2, 54.88% in Stage 3, and 72.02% in Stage 4 over the standard
unguided prediction. However, our task leaves a significant challenge for NLP
researchers to further improve OOD performance at each stage.</span>

language generation, but as models&#x27; fluency improves, how well can evaluators
detect and judge machine-generated text? We run a study assessing non-experts&#x27;
ability to distinguish between human- and machine-authored text (GPT2 and GPT3)
in three domains (stories, news articles, and recipes). We find that, without
training, evaluators distinguished between GPT3- and human-authored text at

evaluators to better identify GPT3-authored text (detailed instructions,
annotated examples, and paired examples) and find that while evaluators&#x27;
accuracy improved up to 55%, it did not significantly improve across the three
domains. Given the inconsistent results across text domains and the often
contradictory reasons evaluators gave for their judgments, we examine the role
untrained human evaluations play in NLG evaluation and provide recommendations

reliable and accurate question answering systems. A recent study showed that
manual summarization of consumer health questions brings significant
improvement in retrieving relevant answers. However, the automatic
summarization of long questions is a challenging task due to the lack of
training data and the complexity of the related subtasks, such as the question
focus and type recognition. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement
learning-based framework for abstractive question summarization. We propose two
novel rewards obtained from the downstream tasks of (i) question-type
identification and (ii) question-focus recognition to regularize the question
generation model. These rewards ensure the generation of semantically valid
questions and encourage the inclusion of key medical entities/foci in the
question summary. We evaluated our proposed method on two benchmark datasets
and achieved higher performance over state-of-the-art models. The manual
evaluation of the summaries reveals that the generated questions are more
diverse and have fewer factual inconsistencies than the baseline summaries</span>

shared goals. Successful collaboration requires not only adopting the same
communicative conventions, but also grounding these conventions in the same
task-appropriate conceptual abstractions. We investigate how humans use natural
language to collaboratively solve physical assembly problems more effectively
over time. Human participants were paired up in an online environment to
reconstruct scenes containing two block towers. One participant could see the
target towers, and sent assembly instructions for the other participant to
reconstruct. Participants provided increasingly concise instructions across
repeated attempts on each pair of towers, using higher-level referring
expressions that captured each scene&#x27;s hierarchical structure. To explain these
findings, we extend recent probabilistic models of ad-hoc convention formation
with an explicit perceptual learning mechanism. These results shed light on the
inductive biases that enable intelligent agents to coordinate upon shared
procedural abstractions.</span>

                                        <span>In his pioneering research, G. K. Zipf formulated a couple of statistical
laws on the relationship between the frequency of a word with its number of
meanings: the law of meaning distribution, relating the frequency of a word and
its frequency rank, and the meaning-frequency law, relating the frequency of a
word with its number of meanings. Although these laws were formulated more than
half a century ago, they have been only investigated in a few languages. Here
we present the first study of these laws in Catalan.

We verify these laws in Catalan via the relationship among their exponents
and that of the rank-frequency law. We present a new protocol for the analysis
of these Zipfian laws that can be extended to other languages. We report the
first evidence of two marked regimes for these laws in written language and
speech, paralleling the two regimes in Zipf&#x27;s rank-frequency law in large
multi-author corpora discovered in early 2000s. Finally, the implications of
these two regimes will be discussed.</span>

non-linear mapping between two manifolds by explicitly training it to be
bijective. We demonstrate BDMA by training a model for a pair of languages
rather than individual, directed source and target combinations, reducing the
number of models by 50%. We show that models trained with BDMA in the &quot;forward&quot;
(source to target) direction can successfully map words in the &quot;reverse&quot;
(target to source) direction, yielding equivalent (or better) performance to
standard unidirectional translation models where the source and target language
is flipped. We also show how BDMA reduces the overall size of the model.</span>

type ontology which differentiates the nuanced nature of questions better than
widely used question words. A new dataset with 4,959 questions is labeled based
on the new ontology. We then propose a novel question type-aware question
generation framework, augmented by a semantic graph representation, to jointly
predict question focuses and produce the question. Based on this framework, we
further use both exemplars and automatically generated templates to improve
controllability and diversity. Experiments on two newly collected large-scale

comparisons based on automatic metrics. Human judges also rate our model
outputs highly in answerability, coverage of scope, and overall quality.

pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for
resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of
parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating
BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing
strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving
competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long
inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly
improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed
confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional
parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT
achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2$\times$ to 10$\times$
with negligible accuracy degradation compared to ALBERT on various datasets.
Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used
for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to
understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the
decision-making process of it in ELBERT.</span>

                                        <span>One of the most prominent attributes of Neural Networks (NNs) constitutes
their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from
high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their
exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of
modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex
cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to
deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack
of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their
general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted
features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding
the vector space before the NNs&#x27; output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten
the deep feature vectors&#x27; properties under classification tasks. Main attention
is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse
effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived
from our model&#x27;s formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition
scenarios, proving its prominence by improving the obtained results.</span>

explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image,
while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to
high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of
latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the
refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of
compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic
transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows
flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of
the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model&#x27;s strength and
robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from
simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor
scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality
and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further
qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model&#x27;s

disentanglement, and illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach. An

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

high dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum
many-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with
tensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification. In
this work, we propose a novel formulation of tensor networks for supervised
image segmentation which allows them to operate on high resolution medical
images. We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping
patches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a
pixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed
model is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a
Strided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of
the proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and
compared to relevant baselines. The evaluation shows that the strided tensor
network yields competitive performance compared to CNN-based models while using
fewer resources. Additionally, based on the experiments we discuss the
feasibility of using fully linear models for segmentation tasks.</span>

proposed in this paper. Different feature fusion techniques are suggested to
facilitate the flow of information and improve the training of deep neural
networks. Some of these techniques as well as the proposed network can be
considered a type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Network, where a layer can
receive inputs from other layers and have outputs to other layers. In the
proposed general framework of Lattice Fusion Network (LFNet), feature maps of
each convolutional layer are passed to other layers based on a lattice graph
structure, where nodes are convolutional layers. To evaluate the performance of
the proposed architecture, different designs based on the general framework of
LFNet are implemented for the task of image denoising. This task is used as an
example where training deep convolutional networks is needed. Results are
compared with state of the art methods. The proposed network is able to achieve
better results with far fewer learnable parameters, which shows the
effectiveness of LFNets for training of deep neural networks.</span>

learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis.
Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse
multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to
combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities
(such as H&amp;E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a
comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality
are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the
information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal
orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by
incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS
in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly
outperforming (p&#x3D;0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median
C-index of 0.718 +/- 0.064. The prognostic model significantly stratifies
glioma patients by OS within clinical subsets, adding further granularity to
prognostic clinical grading and molecular subtyping.</span>

several domains, relying on minimal architectural priors from the designer. In
Human Action Recognition (HAR), attention mechanisms have been primarily
adopted on top of standard convolutional or recurrent layers, improving the
overall generalization capability. In this work, we introduce Action
Transformer (AcT), a simple, fully self-attentional architecture that
consistently outperforms more elaborated networks that mix convolutional,
recurrent, and attentive layers. In order to limit computational and energy
requests, building on previous human action recognition research, the proposed
approach exploits 2D pose representations over small temporal windows,
providing a low latency solution for accurate and effective real-time
performance. Moreover, we open-source MPOSE2021, a new large-scale dataset, as
an attempt to build a formal training and evaluation benchmark for real-time
short-time human action recognition. Extensive experimentation on MPOSE2021
with our proposed methodology and several previous architectural solutions

important problem in fashion e-commerce: color variants identification, i.e.,
identifying fashion products that match exactly in their design (or style), but
only to differ in their color. At first we attempt to tackle the problem by
obtaining manual annotations (depicting whether two products are color
variants), and train a supervised triplet loss based neural network model to
learn representations of fashion products. However, for large scale real-world
industrial datasets such as addressed in our paper, it is infeasible to obtain
annotations for the entire dataset, while capturing all the difficult corner
cases. Interestingly, we observed that color variants are essentially
manifestations of color jitter based augmentations. Thus, we instead explore
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to solve this problem. We observed that existing

propose a novel SSL based color variants model that simultaneously focuses on
different parts of an apparel. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows

                                        <span>Face editing represents a popular research topic within the computer vision
and image processing communities. While significant progress has been made
recently in this area, existing solutions: (i) are still largely focused on
low-resolution images, (ii) often generate editing results with visual
artefacts, or (iii) lack fine-grained control and alter multiple (entangled)
attributes at once, when trying to generate the desired facial semantics. In
this paper, we aim to address these issues though a novel attribute editing
approach called MaskFaceGAN. The proposed approach is based on an optimization
procedure that directly optimizes the latent code of a pre-trained
(state-of-the-art) Generative Adversarial Network (i.e., StyleGAN2) with
respect to several constraints that ensure: (i) preservation of relevant image
content, (ii) generation of the targeted facial attributes, and (iii)
spatially--selective treatment of local image areas. The constraints are
enforced with the help of an (differentiable) attribute classifier and face
parser that provide the necessary reference information for the optimization
procedure. MaskFaceGAN is evaluated in extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ,
Helen and SiblingsDB-HQf datasets and in comparison with several
state-of-the-art techniques from the literature, i.e., StarGAN, AttGAN, STGAN,
and two versions of InterFaceGAN. Our experimental results show that the
proposed approach is able to edit face images with respect to several facial
attributes with unprecedented image quality and at high-resolutions
(1024x1024), while exhibiting considerably less problems with attribute
entanglement than competing solutions. The source code is made freely available

the data. Inevitably, an independent stream is introduced to extract features

methodology which sacrifices the model size to improve the detection accuracy
may impede the practical application of SOD problems. To tackle this dilemma,
we propose a dynamic distillation method along with a lightweight framework,

dynamically assigns the distillation weight instead of applying a fixed weight

enable applications such as autonomous driving, socially-aware robot assistant

Many systems do not provide high-level semantic attributes to reason about
pedestrian future. This design hinders prediction performance in video data

model for automated localization of clinically significant prostate cancer
(csPCa) in bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI). Deep attention mechanisms drive
its detection network, targeting salient structures and highly discriminative
feature dimensions across multiple resolutions. Its goal is to accurately
identify csPCa lesions from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign
pathology that can afflict the prostate gland. Simultaneously, a decoupled
residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive reduction,
without sacrificing high sensitivity or computational efficiency. In order to
guide model generalization with domain-specific clinical knowledge, a
probabilistic anatomical prior is used to encode the spatial prevalence and
zonal distinction of csPCa. Using a large dataset of 1950 prostate bpMRI paired
with radiologically-estimated annotations, we hypothesize that such CNN-based
models can be trained to detect biopsy-confirmed malignancies in an independent
cohort.

For 486 institutional testing scans, the 3D CAD system achieves
83.69$\pm$5.22% and 93.19$\pm$2.96% detection sensitivity at 0.50 and 1.46

learning to perform vision-based manipulation (e.g. picking up objects)? We
study this problem under the framework of transfer learning, where the model is
first trained on a passive vision task, and adapted to perform an active
manipulation task. We find that pre-training on vision tasks significantly
improves generalization and sample efficiency for learning to manipulate
objects. However, realizing these gains requires careful selection of which
parts of the model to transfer. Our key insight is that outputs of standard
vision models highly correlate with affordance maps commonly used in
manipulation. Therefore, we explore directly transferring model parameters from
vision networks to affordance prediction networks, and show that this can
result in successful zero-shot adaptation, where a robot can pick up certain
objects with zero robotic experience. With just a small amount of robotic
experience, we can further fine-tune the affordance model to achieve better
results. With just 10 minutes of suction experience or 1 hour of grasping
experience, our method achieves ~80% success rate at picking up novel objects.</span>

                                        <span>We present CSWin Transformer, an efficient and effective Transformer-based
backbone for general-purpose vision tasks. A challenging issue in Transformer
design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local
self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address
this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for
computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel
that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the
input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a detailed mathematical
analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for
different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling
capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce
Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional
information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports
arbitrary input resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for
downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure,
CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks.
Specifically, it achieves 85.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra
training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection
task, and 51.7 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing
previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and
+2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting. By further pretraining on
the larger dataset ImageNet-21K, we achieve 87.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K
and state-of-the-art segmentation performance on ADE20K with 55.2 mIoU. The

task. Previous solutions based on 6D grasp synthesis with robot motion planning
usually operate in an open-loop setting, which are sensitive to grasp synthesis
errors. In this work, we propose a new method for learning closed-loop control
policies for 6D grasping. Our policy takes a segmented point cloud of an object
from an egocentric camera as input, and outputs continuous 6D control actions
of the robot gripper for grasping the object. We combine imitation learning and
reinforcement learning and introduce a goal-auxiliary actor-critic algorithm
for policy learning. We demonstrate that our learned policy can be integrated
into a tabletop 6D grasping system and a human-robot handover system to improve
the grasping performance of unseen objects. Our videos and code can be found at

inventory management and remote sensing based forest surveys are largely
carried out through satellite images. However, most of these surveys only use
2D spectral information which normally has not enough clues for ITDD. To fully
explore the satellite images, we propose a ITDD method using the orthophoto and
digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our
algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract
the local maxima from DSM as treetops, and then feed them to a modi-fied
superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown
delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological
characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify
potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three
representative regions have demonstrated promising results - the best overall
detection accuracy can be 89%.</span>

with Point-of-Interest (PoI) features. Differentiating multiple potential
instances within a single PoI feature is challenging because learning a
high-dimensional mask feature for each instance using vanilla convolution
demands a heavy computing burden. To address this challenge, we propose an
instance-aware convolution. It decomposes this mask representation learning
task into two tractable modules as instance-aware weights and instance-agnostic
features. The former is to parametrize convolution for producing mask features
corresponding to different instances, improving mask learning efficiency by
avoiding employing several independent convolutions. Meanwhile, the latter
serves as mask templates in a single point. Together, instance-aware mask
features are computed by convolving the template with dynamic weights, used for
the mask prediction. Along with instance-aware convolution, we propose
PointINS, a simple and practical instance segmentation approach, building upon
dense one-stage detectors. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated the
effectiveness of our framework built upon RetinaNet and FCOS. PointINS in
ResNet101 backbone achieves a 38.3 mask mean average precision (mAP) on COCO
dataset, outperforming existing point-based methods by a large margin. It gives
a comparable performance to the region-based Mask R-CNN with faster inference.</span>

can better be modeled as compositions of objects and their relations as opposed
to distributed representations. This inductive bias can be injected into neural
networks to potentially improve systematic generalization and learning
efficiency of downstream tasks in scenes with multiple objects. In this paper,
we train state-of-the-art unsupervised models on five common multi-object
datasets and evaluate segmentation accuracy and downstream object property
prediction. In addition, we study systematic generalization and robustness by
investigating the settings where either single objects are out-of-distribution
-- e.g., having unseen colors, textures, and shapes -- or global properties of
the scene are altered -- e.g., by occlusions, cropping, or increasing the
number of objects. From our experimental study, we find object-centric
representations to be generally useful for downstream tasks and robust to
shifts in the data distribution, especially if shifts affect single objects.</span>

existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while
neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we
focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by
cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable
CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to
only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse
Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few)
class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter&#x27;s activation to pass only
when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and
highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger
interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our
model displays benefits in applications like object localization and
adversarial sample detection. Code link: https://github.com/hyliang96/CSGCNN.</span>

                                        <span>This article introduces a new physics-based method for rigid point set
alignment called Fast Gravitational Approach (FGA). In FGA, the source and
target point sets are interpreted as rigid particle swarms with masses
interacting in a globally multiply-linked manner while moving in a simulated
gravitational force field. The optimal alignment is obtained by explicit
modeling of forces acting on the particles as well as their velocities and
displacements with second-order ordinary differential equations of motion.
Additional alignment cues (point-based or geometric features, and other
boundary conditions) can be integrated into FGA through particle masses. We
propose a smooth-particle mass function for point mass initialization, which
improves robustness to noise and structural discontinuities. To avoid
prohibitive quadratic complexity of all-to-all point interactions, we adapt a
Barnes-Hut tree for accelerated force computation and achieve quasilinear
computational complexity. We show that the new method class has characteristics
not found in previous alignment methods such as efficient handling of partial
overlaps, inhomogeneous point sampling densities, and coping with large point
clouds with reduced runtime compared to the state of the art. Experiments show
that our method performs on par with or outperforms all compared competing
non-deep-learning-based and general-purpose techniques (which do not assume the
availability of training data and a scene prior) in resolving transformations
for LiDAR data and gains state-of-the-art accuracy and speed when coping with
different types of data disturbances.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of convective storm nowcasting is local prediction of severe and
imminent convective storms. Here, we consider the convective storm nowcasting
problem from the perspective of machine learning. First, we use a pixel-wise
sampling method to construct spatiotemporal features for nowcasting, and
flexibly adjust the proportions of positive and negative samples in the
training set to mitigate class-imbalance issues. Second, we employ a concise
two-stream convolutional neural network to extract spatial and temporal cues
for nowcasting. This simplifies the network structure, reduces the training
time requirement, and improves classification accuracy. The two-stream network
used both radar and satellite data. In the resulting two-stream, fused
convolutional neural network, some of the parameters are entered into a
single-stream convolutional neural network, but it can learn the features of
many data. Further, considering the relevance of classification and regression
tasks, we develop a multi-task learning strategy that predicts the labels used
in such tasks. We integrate two-stream multi-task learning into a single
convolutional neural network. Given the compact architecture, this network is
more efficient and easier to optimize than existing recurrent neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>The subject of &quot;fairness&quot; in artificial intelligence (AI) refers to assessing
AI algorithms for potential bias based on demographic characteristics such as
race and gender, and the development of algorithms to address this bias. Most
applications to date have been in computer vision, although some work in
healthcare has started to emerge. The use of deep learning (DL) in cardiac MR
segmentation has led to impressive results in recent years, and such techniques
are starting to be translated into clinical practice. However, no work has yet
investigated the fairness of such models. In this work, we perform such an
analysis for racial/gender groups, focusing on the problem of training data
imbalance, using a nnU-Net model trained and evaluated on cine short axis
cardiac MR data from the UK Biobank dataset, consisting of 5,903 subjects from
6 different racial groups. We find statistically significant differences in
Dice performance between different racial groups. To reduce the racial bias, we
investigated three strategies: (1) stratified batch sampling, in which batch
sampling is stratified to ensure balance between racial groups; (2) fair
meta-learning for segmentation, in which a DL classifier is trained to classify
race and jointly optimized with the segmentation model; and (3) protected group
models, in which a different segmentation model is trained for each racial
group. We also compared the results to the scenario where we have a perfectly
balanced database. To assess fairness we used the standard deviation (SD) and
skewed error ratio (SER) of the average Dice values. Our results demonstrate
that the racial bias results from the use of imbalanced training data, and that
all proposed bias mitigation strategies improved fairness, with the best SD and
SER resulting from the use of protected group models.</span>

while its loop closure detection is still an open issue. With the development
of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be
obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and
conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM
with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in
odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a
semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane
constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in
our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve
the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a
global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive
experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly
improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and
achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a novel layer based on fast Walsh-Hadamard
transform (WHT) and smooth-thresholding to replace $1\times 1$ convolution
layers in deep neural networks. In the WHT domain, we denoise the transform
domain coefficients using the new smooth-thresholding non-linearity, a smoothed
version of the well-known soft-thresholding operator. We also introduce a
family of multiplication-free operators from the basic 2$\times$2 Hadamard
transform to implement $3\times 3$ depthwise separable convolution layers.
Using these two types of layers, we replace the bottleneck layers in
MobileNet-V2 to reduce the network&#x27;s number of parameters with a slight loss in
accuracy. For example, by replacing the final third bottleneck layers, we
reduce the number of parameters from 2.270M to 540K. This reduces the accuracy
from 95.21\% to 92.98\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our approach significantly
improves the speed of data processing. The fast Walsh-Hadamard transform has a
computational complexity of $O(m\log_2 m)$. As a result, it is computationally
more efficient than the $1\times1$ convolution layer. The fast Walsh-Hadamard
layer processes a tensor in $\mathbb{R}^{10\times32\times32\times1024}$ about 2
times faster than $1\times1$ convolution layer on NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer
board.</span>

                                        <span>Skeleton sequences are lightweight and compact, thus are ideal candidates for
action recognition on edge devices. Recent skeleton-based action recognition
methods extract features from 3D joint coordinates as spatial-temporal cues,
using these representations in a graph neural network for feature fusion to
boost recognition performance. The use of first- and second-order features,
\ie{} joint and bone representations, has led to high accuracy. Nonetheless,
many models are still confused by actions that have similar motion
trajectories. To address these issues, we propose fusing third-order features
in the form of angular encoding into modern architectures to robustly capture
the relationships between joints and body parts. This simple fusion with
popular spatial-temporal graph neural networks achieves new state-of-the-art
accuracy in two large benchmarks, including NTU60 and NTU120, while employing
fewer parameters and reduced run time. Our source code is publicly available

                                        <span>Multimodal VAEs seek to model the joint distribution over heterogeneous data
(e.g.\ vision, language), whilst also capturing a shared representation across
such modalities. Prior work has typically combined information from the
modalities by reconciling idiosyncratic representations directly in the
recognition model through explicit products, mixtures, or other such
factorisations. Here we introduce a novel alternative, the MEME, that avoids
such explicit combinations by repurposing semi-supervised VAEs to combine
information between modalities implicitly through mutual supervision. This
formulation naturally allows learning from partially-observed data where some
modalities can be entirely missing -- something that most existing approaches
either cannot handle, or do so to a limited extent. We demonstrate that MEME
outperforms baselines on standard metrics across both partial and complete
observation schemes on the MNIST-SVHN (image-image) and CUB (image-text)
datasets. We also contrast the quality of the representations learnt by mutual
supervision against standard approaches and observe interesting trends in its
ability to capture relatedness between data.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) problem. While
some recently proposed algorithms utilized variants of knowledge distillation
(KD) technique to tackle the problem, they only partially addressed the key
additional challenges in CISS that causes the catastrophic forgetting; i.e.,
the semantic drift of the background class and multi-label prediction issue. To
better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M
(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining
several techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we
make three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background
class to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone
network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling
to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny
exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and
stability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better
performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough and
extensive ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem
compared to the standard class-incremental learning for classification.</span>

challenging tasks directly from visual observations, generalizing learned
skills to novel environments remains very challenging. Extensive use of data
augmentation is a promising technique for improving generalization in RL, but
it is often found to decrease sample efficiency and can even lead to
divergence. In this paper, we investigate causes of instability when using data
augmentation in common off-policy RL algorithms. We identify two problems, both
rooted in high-variance Q-targets. Based on our findings, we propose a simple
yet effective technique for stabilizing this class of algorithms under
augmentation. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of image-based RL using
both ConvNets and Vision Transformers (ViT) on a family of benchmarks based on
DeepMind Control Suite, as well as in robotic manipulation tasks. Our method
greatly improves stability and sample efficiency of ConvNets under
augmentation, and achieves generalization results competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for image-based RL. We further show that our method
scales to RL with ViT-based architectures, and that data augmentation may be
especially important in this setting.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, pure transformer-based models have shown great potentials for
vision tasks such as image classification and detection. However, the design of
transformer networks is challenging. It has been observed that the depth,
embedding dimension, and number of heads can largely affect the performance of
vision transformers. Previous models configure these dimensions based upon
manual crafting. In this work, we propose a new one-shot architecture search
framework, namely AutoFormer, dedicated to vision transformer search.
AutoFormer entangles the weights of different blocks in the same layers during
supernet training. Benefiting from the strategy, the trained supernet allows
thousands of subnets to be very well-trained. Specifically, the performance of
these subnets with weights inherited from the supernet is comparable to those
retrained from scratch. Besides, the searched models, which we refer to
AutoFormers, surpass the recent state-of-the-arts such as ViT and DeiT. In
particular, AutoFormer-tiny/small/base achieve 74.7%/81.7%/82.4% top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet with 5.7M/22.9M/53.7M parameters, respectively. Lastly, we verify
the transferability of AutoFormer by providing the performance on downstream
benchmarks and distillation experiments. Code and models are available at

whole story and features the most important scenes. Yet the importance of
scenes in a video is often subjective, and users should have the option of
customizing the summary by using natural language to specify what is important
to them. Further, existing models for fully automatic generic summarization
have not exploited available language models, which can serve as an effective
prior for saliency. This work introduces CLIP-It, a single framework for
addressing both generic and query-focused video summarization, typically
approached separately in the literature. We propose a language-guided
multimodal transformer that learns to score frames in a video based on their
importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined
query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense
video caption (for generic video summarization). Our model can be extended to
the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. We
outperform baselines and prior work by a significant margin on both standard
video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and a query-focused video
summarization dataset (QFVS). Particularly, we achieve large improvements in
the transfer setting, attesting to our method&#x27;s strong generalization

                                        <span>Binarization is a well-known image processing task, whose objective is to
separate the foreground of an image from the background. One of the many tasks
for which it is useful is that of preprocessing document images in order to
identify relevant information, such as text or symbols. The wide variety of
document types, alphabets, and formats makes binarization challenging. There
are multiple proposals with which to solve this problem, from classical
manually-adjusted methods, to more recent approaches based on machine learning.
The latter techniques require a large amount of training data in order to
obtain good results; however, labeling a portion of each existing collection of
documents is not feasible in practice. This is a common problem in supervised
learning, which can be addressed by using the so-called Domain Adaptation (DA)
techniques. These techniques take advantage of the knowledge learned in one
domain, for which labeled data are available, to apply it to other domains for
which there are no labeled data. This paper proposes a method that combines
neural networks and DA in order to carry out unsupervised document
binarization. However, when both the source and target domains are very
similar, this adaptation could be detrimental. Our methodology, therefore,
first measures the similarity between domains in an innovative manner in order
to determine whether or not it is appropriate to apply the adaptation process.
The results reported in the experimentation, when evaluating up to 20 possible
combinations among five different domains, show that our proposal successfully
deals with the binarization of new document domains without the need for
labeled data.</span>

satellite images, while adjustment accuracy is correlated with feature matching
results. Feature match-ing often contains high uncertainties in weak/repeat
textures, while BA results are helpful in reducing these uncertainties. To
compute more accurate orientations, this article incorpo-rates BA and feature
matching in a unified framework and formulates the union as the optimization of
a global energy function so that the solutions of the BA and feature matching
are constrained with each other. To avoid a degeneracy in the optimization, we
propose a comprised solution by breaking the optimization of the global energy
function into two-step suboptimizations and compute the local minimums of each
suboptimization in an incremental manner. Experiments on multi-view
high-resolution satellite images show that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art orientation techniques with or without accurate least-squares

on specific visual recognition tasks, notably on datasets like ImageNet.
However, high accuracy can be achieved in many ways. The particular decision
function found by a machine learning system is determined not only by the data
to which the system is exposed, but also the inductive biases of the model,
which are typically harder to characterize. In this work, we follow a recent
trend of in-depth behavioral analyses of neural network models that go beyond
accuracy as an evaluation metric by looking at patterns of errors. Our focus is
on comparing a suite of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a
recently-proposed attention-based network, the Vision Transformer (ViT), which
relaxes the translation-invariance constraint of CNNs and therefore represents
a model with a weaker set of inductive biases. Attention-based networks have
previously been shown to achieve higher accuracy than CNNs on vision tasks, and
we demonstrate, using new metrics for examining error consistency with more
granularity, that their errors are also more consistent with those of humans.
These results have implications both for building more human-like vision
models, as well as for understanding visual object recognition in humans.</span>

based on a novel sparsity-inducing optimization framework. This method is
derived from the multiple observations, that is, semi-sparsity prior knowledge
is more universally applicable, especially in areas where sparsity is not fully
admitted, such as polynomial-smoothing surfaces. We illustrate that this
semi-sparsity can be identified into a generalized $L_0$-norm minimization in
higher-order gradient domains, thereby giving rise to a new &#x60;&#x60;feature-aware&#x27;&#x27;
filtering method with a powerful simultaneous-fitting ability in both sparse
features (singularities and sharpening edges) and non-sparse regions
(polynomial-smoothing surfaces). Notice that a direct solver is always
unavailable due to the non-convexity and combinatorial nature of $L_0$-norm
minimization. Instead, we solve the model based on an efficient half-quadratic
splitting minimization with fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) for acceleration. We
finally demonstrate its versatility and many benefits to a series of

                                        <span>Recent work has shown great progress in building photorealistic animatable
full-body codec avatars, but these avatars still face difficulties in
generating high-fidelity animation of clothing. To address the difficulties, we
propose a method to build an animatable clothed body avatar with an explicit
representation of the clothing on the upper body from multi-view captured
videos. We use a two-layer mesh representation to separately register the 3D
scans with templates. In order to improve the photometric correspondence across
different frames, texture alignment is then performed through inverse rendering
of the clothing geometry and texture predicted by a variational autoencoder. We
then train a new two-layer codec avatar with separate modeling of the upper
clothing and the inner body layer. To learn the interaction between the body
dynamics and clothing states, we use a temporal convolution network to predict
the clothing latent code based on a sequence of input skeletal poses. We show
photorealistic animation output for three different actors, and demonstrate the
advantage of our clothed-body avatars over single-layer avatars in the previous
work. We also show the benefit of an explicit clothing model which allows the
clothing texture to be edited in the animation output.</span>

                                        <span>A set of novel approaches for estimating epistemic uncertainty in deep neural
networks with a single forward pass has recently emerged as a valid alternative
to Bayesian Neural Networks. On the premise of informative representations,
these deterministic uncertainty methods (DUMs) achieve strong performance on
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data while adding negligible computational
costs at inference time. However, it remains unclear whether DUMs are well
calibrated and can seamlessly scale to real-world applications - both
prerequisites for their practical deployment. To this end, we first provide a
taxonomy of DUMs, evaluate their calibration under continuous distributional
shifts and their performance on OOD detection for image classification tasks.
Then, we extend the most promising approaches to semantic segmentation. We find
that, while DUMs scale to realistic vision tasks and perform well on OOD
detection, the practicality of current methods is undermined by poor
calibration under realistic distributional shifts.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on
various computer vision tasks. The ability of capturing short- and long-range
visual dependencies through self-attention is arguably the main source for the
success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead,
especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection). In
this paper, we present focal self-attention, a new mechanism that incorporates
both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions. Using this new
mechanism, each token attends the closest surrounding tokens at fine
granularity but the tokens far away at coarse granularity, and thus can capture
both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively.
With focal self-attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer
models, called Focal Transformer, which achieves superior performance over the
state-of-the-art vision Transformers on a range of public image classification
and object detection benchmarks. In particular, our Focal Transformer models
with a moderate size of 51.1M and a larger size of 89.8M achieve 83.5 and 83.8
Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224x224 resolution.
Using Focal Transformers as the backbones, we obtain consistent and substantial
improvements over the current state-of-the-art Swin Transformers for 6
different object detection methods trained with standard 1x and 3x schedules.
Our largest Focal Transformer yields 58.7/58.9 box mAPs and 50.9/51.3 mask mAPs
on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and 55.4 mIoU on ADE20K for semantic segmentation,
creating new SoTA on three of the most challenging computer vision tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning models generally learn the biases present in the training data.
Researchers have proposed several approaches to mitigate such biases and make
the model fair. Bias mitigation techniques assume that a sufficiently large
number of training examples are present. However, we observe that if the
training data is limited, then the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods is
severely degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this
problem. Specifically, we adapt self-supervision and self-distillation to
reduce the impact of biases on the model in this setting. Self-supervision and
self-distillation are not used for bias mitigation. However, through this work,
we demonstrate for the first time that these techniques are very effective in
bias mitigation. We empirically show that our approach can significantly reduce
the biases learned by the model. Further, we experimentally demonstrate that
our approach is complementary to other bias mitigation strategies. Our approach
significantly improves their performance and further reduces the model biases
in the limited data regime. Specifically, on the L-CIFAR-10S skewed dataset,
our approach significantly reduces the bias score of the baseline model by
78.22% and outperforms it in terms of accuracy by a significant absolute margin
of 8.89%. It also significantly reduces the bias score for the state-of-the-art
domain independent bias mitigation method by 59.26% and improves its
performance by a significant absolute margin of 7.08%.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance
with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning
interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of
self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which
makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required.
In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually
simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term
spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our
architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision transformers with
three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise
multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters,
and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity
trade-offs of our models on both ImageNet and downstream tasks. Our results
demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to
transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and
robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/GFNet</span>

However, the lack of access a to large-scale annotated dataset poses a great
challenge, especially in the case of rare diseases, or new domains for the
research society. Transfer of pre-trained features, from the relatively large
dataset is a considerable solution. In this paper, we have explored supervised
segmentation using domain adaptation for optic nerve and orbital tumor, when
only small sampled CT images are given. Even the lung image database consortium
image collection (LIDC-IDRI) is a cross-domain to orbital CT, but the proposed
domain adaptation method improved the performance of attention U-Net for the
segmentation in public optic nerve dataset and our clinical orbital tumor

the individually classified maps of the multitemporal data set. Due to varying
acquisition conditions (e.g., illumination, sensors, seasonal differences), the
classification maps yielded are often inconsistent through time for robust
statistical analysis. 3D geometric features have been shown to be stable for
assessing differences across the temporal data set. Therefore, in this article
we investigate he use of a multitemporal orthophoto and digital surface model
derived from satellite data for spatiotemporal classification. Our approach
consists of two major steps: generating per-class probability distribution maps
using the random-forest classifier with limited training samples, and making
spatiotemporal inferences using an iterative 3D spatiotemporal filter operating
on per-class probability maps. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods can consistently improve the individual classification results
by 2%-6% and thus can be an important postclassification refinement approach.</span>

Boundary Detection (GEBD) Challenge at CVPR21. In this work, we design a
Cascaded Temporal Attention Network (CASTANET) for GEBD, which is formed by
three parts, the backbone network, the temporal attention module, and the
classification module. Specifically, the Channel-Separated Convolutional
Network (CSN) is used as the backbone network to extract features, and the
temporal attention module is designed to enforce the network to focus on the
discriminative features. After that, the cascaded architecture is used in the
classification module to generate more accurate boundaries. In addition, the
ensemble strategy is used to further improve the performance of the proposed
method. The proposed method achieves 83.30% F1 score on Kinetics-GEBD test set,
which improves 20.5% F1 score compared to the baseline method. Code is

                                        <span>Human vision is naturally more attracted by some regions within their field
of view than others. This intrinsic selectivity mechanism, so-called visual
attention, is influenced by both high- and low-level factors; such as the
global environment (illumination, background texture, etc.), stimulus
characteristics (color, intensity, orientation, etc.), and some prior visual
information. Visual attention is useful for many computer vision applications
such as image compression, recognition, and captioning. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end deep-based method, so-called SALYPATH (SALiencY and
scanPATH), that efficiently predicts the scanpath of an image through features
of a saliency model. The idea is predict the scanpath by exploiting the
capacity of a deep-based model to predict the saliency. The proposed method was
evaluated through 2 well-known datasets. The results obtained showed the
relevance of the proposed framework comparing to state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Training deep neural networks with an $L_0$ regularization is one of the
prominent approaches for network pruning or sparsification. The method prunes
the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero.
However, recent work of Gale et al. reveals that although this method yields
high compression rates on smaller datasets, it performs inconsistently on
large-scale learning tasks, such as ResNet50 on ImageNet. We analyze this
phenomenon through the lens of variational inference and find that it is likely
due to the independent modeling of binary gates, the mean-field approximation,
which is known in Bayesian statistics for its poor performance due to the crude
approximation. To mitigate this deficiency, we propose a dependency modeling of
binary gates, which can be modeled effectively as a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). We term our algorithm Dep-$L_0$ as it prunes networks via a
dependency-enabled $L_0$ regularization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10,
CIFAR100 and ImageNet with VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet56 show that our Dep-$L_0$
outperforms the original $L_0$-HC algorithm of Louizos et al. by a significant
margin, especially on ImageNet. Compared with the state-of-the-arts network
sparsification algorithms, our dependency modeling makes the $L_0$-based
sparsification once again very competitive on large-scale learning tasks. Our

based on randomized smoothing. The method leverages a novel scalable algorithm
for prediction and certification that correctly accounts for multiple testing,
necessary for ensuring statistical guarantees. The key to our approach is
reliance on established multiple-testing correction mechanisms as well as the
ability to abstain from classifying single pixels or points while still
robustly segmenting the overall input. Our experimental evaluation on synthetic

                                        <span>This paper proposes a lossless point cloud (PC) geometry compression method
that uses neural networks to estimate the probability distribution of voxel
occupancy. First, to take into account the PC sparsity, our method adaptively
partitions a point cloud into multiple voxel block sizes. This partitioning is
signalled via an octree. Second, we employ a deep auto-regressive generative
model to estimate the occupancy probability of each voxel given the previously
encoded ones. We then employ the estimated probabilities to code efficiently a
block using a context-based arithmetic coder. Our context has variable size and
can expand beyond the current block to learn more accurate probabilities. We
also consider using data augmentation techniques to increase the generalization
capability of the learned probability models, in particular in the presence of
noise and lower-density point clouds. Experimental evaluation, performed on a
variety of point clouds from four different datasets and with diverse
characteristics, demonstrates that our method reduces significantly (by up to
30%) the rate for lossless coding compared to the state-of-the-art MPEG codec.</span>

fields of machine learning and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The focus has mainly
been on per-frame classification. More recently, polyp segmentation has gained
attention in the medical community. Segmentation has the advantage of being
more accurate than per-frame classification or object detection as it can show
the affected area in greater detail. For our contribution to the EndoCV 2021
segmentation challenge, we propose two separate approaches. First, a
segmentation model named TriUNet composed of three separate UNet models.
Second, we combine TriUNet with an ensemble of well-known segmentation models,
namely UNet++, FPN, DeepLabv3, and DeepLabv3+, into a model called
DivergentNets to produce more generalizable medical image segmentation masks.
In addition, we propose a modified Dice loss that calculates loss only for a
single class when performing multiclass segmentation, forcing the model to
focus on what is most important. Overall, the proposed methods achieved the
best average scores for each respective round in the challenge, with TriUNet
being the winning model in Round I and DivergentNets being the winning model in
Round II of the segmentation generalization challenge at EndoCV 2021. The
implementation of our approach is made publicly available on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Driven by recent advances in object detection with deep neural networks, the
tracking-by-detection paradigm has gained increasing prevalence in the research
community of multi-object tracking (MOT). It has long been known that
appearance information plays an essential role in the detection-to-track
association, which lies at the core of the tracking-by-detection paradigm.
While most existing works consider the appearance distances between the
detections and the tracks, they ignore the statistical information implied by
the historical appearance distance records in the tracks, which can be
particularly useful when a detection has similar distances with two or more
tracks. In this work, we propose a hybrid track association (HTA) algorithm
that models the historical appearance distances of a track with an incremental
Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) and incorporates the derived statistical
information into the calculation of the detection-to-track association cost.
Experimental results on three MOT benchmarks confirm that HTA effectively
improves the target identification performance with a small compromise to the
tracking speed. Additionally, compared to many state-of-the-art trackers, the
DeepSORT tracker equipped with HTA achieves better or comparable performance in
terms of the balance of tracking quality and speed.</span>

approach to uncover data bias by means of attribution maps. For this purpose,
first an artificial dataset with a known bias is created and used to train

                                        <span>Previous works indicate that the glyph of Chinese characters contains rich
semantic information and has the potential to enhance the representation of
Chinese characters. The typical method to utilize the glyph features is by
incorporating them into the character embedding space. Inspired by previous
methods, we innovatively propose a Chinese pre-trained representation model
named as GlyphCRM, which abandons the ID-based character embedding method yet
solely based on sequential character images. We render each character into a
binary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it.
Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network,
namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese
characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer
blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information.
Meanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph
module into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to
fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module
can obtain a sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the
long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. Extensive
experimental results indicate that GlyphCRM substantially outperforms the
previous BERT-based state-of-the-art model on 9 fine-tuning tasks, and it has
strong transferability and generalization on specialized fields and
low-resource tasks. We hope this work could spark further research beyond the
realms of well-established representation of Chinese texts.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding the reasons behind the predictions made by deep neural networks
is critical for gaining human trust in many important applications, which is
reflected in the increasing demand for explainability in AI (XAI) in recent
years. Saliency-based feature attribution methods, which highlight important
parts of images that contribute to decisions by classifiers, are often used as
XAI methods, especially in the field of computer vision. In order to compare
various saliency-based XAI methods quantitatively, several approaches for
automated evaluation schemes have been proposed; however, there is no guarantee
that such automated evaluation metrics correctly evaluate explainability, and a
high rating by an automated evaluation scheme does not necessarily mean a high
explainability for humans. In this study, instead of the automated evaluation,
we propose a new human-based evaluation scheme using crowdsourcing to evaluate
XAI methods. Our method is inspired by a human computation game, &quot;Peek-a-boom&quot;,
and can efficiently compare different XAI methods by exploiting the power of
crowds. We evaluate the saliency maps of various XAI methods on two datasets
with automated and crowd-based evaluation schemes. Our experiments show that
the result of our crowd-based evaluation scheme is different from those of
automated evaluation schemes. In addition, we regard the crowd-based evaluation
results as ground truths and provide a quantitative performance measure to
compare different automated evaluation schemes. We also discuss the impact of
crowd workers on the results and show that the varying ability of crowd workers
does not significantly impact the results.</span>

                                        <span>In natural conversation and interaction, our hands often overlap or are in
contact with each other. Due to the homogeneous appearance of hands, this makes
estimating the 3D pose of interacting hands from images difficult. In this
paper we demonstrate that self-similarity, and the resulting ambiguities in
assigning pixel observations to the respective hands and their parts, is a
major cause of the final 3D pose error. Motivated by this insight, we propose
DIGIT, a novel method for estimating the 3D poses of two interacting hands from
a single monocular image. The method consists of two interwoven branches that
process the input imagery into a per-pixel semantic part segmentation mask and
a visual feature volume. In contrast to prior work, we do not decouple the
segmentation from the pose estimation stage, but rather leverage the per-pixel
probabilities directly in the downstream pose estimation task. To do so, the
part probabilities are merged with the visual features and processed via
fully-convolutional layers. We experimentally show that the proposed approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the InterHand2.6M dataset for both
single and interacting hands across all metrics. We provide detailed ablation
studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method and to provide insights into
how the modelling of pixel ownership affects single and interacting hand pose
estimation. Our code will be released for research purposes.</span>

cross-modal understanding and generation, by jointly modeling visual, text and
audio resources. OPT is constructed in an encoder-decoder framework, including
three single-modal encoders to generate token-based embeddings for each
modality, a cross-modal encoder to encode the correlations among the three
modalities, and two cross-modal decoders to generate text and image
respectively. For the OPT&#x27;s pre-training, we design a multi-task pretext
learning scheme to model multi-modal resources from three different data
granularities, \ie, token-, modality-, and sample-level modeling, through which
OPT learns to align and translate among different modalities. The pre-training
task is carried out on a large amount of image-text-audio triplets from Open
Images. Experimental results show that OPT can learn strong image-text-audio
multi-modal representations and achieve promising results on a variety of

                                        <span>Human motion prediction is an essential component for enabling closer
human-robot collaboration. The task of accurately predicting human motion is
non-trivial. It is compounded by the variability of human motion, both at a
skeletal level due to the varying size of humans and at a motion level due to
individual movement&#x27;s idiosyncrasies. These variables make it challenging for
learning algorithms to obtain a general representation that is robust to the
diverse spatio-temporal patterns of human motion. In this work, we propose a
modular sequence learning approach that allows end-to-end training while also
having the flexibility of being fine-tuned. Our approach relies on the
diversity of training samples to first learn a robust representation, which can
then be fine-tuned in a continual learning setup to predict the motion of new
subjects. We evaluated the proposed approach by comparing its performance
against state-of-the-art baselines. The results suggest that our approach
outperforms other methods over all the evaluated temporal horizons, using a
small amount of data for fine-tuning. The improved performance of our approach
opens up the possibility of using continual learning for personalized and
reliable motion prediction.</span>

a deep image segmentation network using particularly weak train-time
annotations: only 6 extreme clicks at the boundary of the objects of interest.
Our fully-automatic method is trained end-to-end and does not require any
test-time annotations. From the extreme points, 3D bounding boxes are extracted
around objects of interest. Then, deep geodesics connecting extreme points are
generated to increase the amount of &quot;annotated&quot; voxels within the bounding
boxes. Finally, a weakly supervised regularised loss derived from a Conditional
Random Field formulation is used to encourage prediction consistency over
homogeneous regions. Extensive experiments are performed on a large open
dataset for Vestibular Schwannoma segmentation. $\textit{InExtremIS}$ obtained
competitive performance, approaching full supervision and outperforming
significantly other weakly supervised techniques based on bounding boxes.
Moreover, given a fixed annotation time budget, $\textit{InExtremIS}$

without directly sharing data within each device, thus preserving privacy and
eliminating the need to store data globally. While there are promising results
under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (iid) local
data, current state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from performance degradation
as the heterogeneity of local data across clients increases. To resolve this
issue, we propose a simple framework, Mean Augmented Federated Learning (MAFL),
where clients send and receive averaged local data, subject to the privacy
requirements of target applications. Under our framework, we propose a new
augmentation algorithm, named FedMix, which is inspired by a phenomenal yet
simple data augmentation method, Mixup, but does not require local raw data to
be directly shared among devices. Our method shows greatly improved performance
in the standard benchmark datasets of FL, under highly non-iid federated

                                        <span>The research of visual signal compression has a long history. Fueled by deep
learning, exciting progress has been made recently. Despite achieving better
compression performance, existing end-to-end compression algorithms are still
designed towards better signal quality in terms of rate-distortion
optimization. In this paper, we show that the design and optimization of
network architecture could be further improved for compression towards machine
vision. We propose an inverted bottleneck structure for end-to-end compression
towards machine vision, which specifically accounts for efficient
representation of the semantic information. Moreover, we quest the capability
of optimization by incorporating the analytics accuracy into the optimization
process, and the optimality is further explored with generalized rate-accuracy
optimization in an iterative manner. We use object detection as a showcase for
end-to-end compression towards machine vision, and extensive experiments show
that the proposed scheme achieves significant BD-rate savings in terms of
analysis performance. Moreover, the promise of the scheme is also demonstrated
with strong generalization capability towards other machine vision tasks, due
to the enabling of signal-level reconstruction.</span>

label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few
explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch&#x27;s Postulates, the
foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we
propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical
diagnosis. By determining and isolating the neuron activation patterns on which
diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector relies to make decisions, we demonstrate the
direct relation between the isolated neuron activation and lesions for a
pathological explanation. To be specific, we first define novel pathological
descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial
and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded
in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically
plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even
arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated
lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly
related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both
qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods.
Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our
second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data
augmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Efficient video action recognition remains a challenging problem. One large
model after another takes the place of the state-of-the-art on the Kinetics
dataset, but real-world efficiency evaluations are often lacking. In this work,
we fill this gap and investigate the use of transformers for efficient action
recognition. We propose a novel, lightweight action recognition architecture,
VideoLightFormer. In a factorized fashion, we carefully extend the 2D
convolutional Temporal Segment Network with transformers, while maintaining
spatial and temporal video structure throughout the entire model. Existing
methods often resort to one of the two extremes, where they either apply huge
transformers to video features, or minimal transformers on highly pooled video
features. Our method differs from them by keeping the transformer models small,
but leveraging full spatiotemporal feature structure. We evaluate
VideoLightFormer in a high-efficiency setting on the temporally-demanding
EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Something-Something-V2 (SSV2) datasets and find that it
achieves a better mix of efficiency and accuracy than existing state-of-the-art
models, apart from the Temporal Shift Module on SSV2.</span>

                                        <span>Place recognition gives a SLAM system the ability to correct cumulative
errors. Unlike images that contain rich texture features, point clouds are
almost pure geometric information which makes place recognition based on point
clouds challenging. Existing works usually encode low-level features such as
coordinate, normal, reflection intensity, etc., as local or global descriptors
to represent scenes. Besides, they often ignore the translation between point
clouds when matching descriptors. Different from most existing methods, we
explore the use of high-level features, namely semantics, to improve the
descriptor&#x27;s representation ability. Also, when matching descriptors, we try to
correct the translation between point clouds to improve accuracy. Concretely,
we propose a novel global descriptor, Semantic Scan Context, which explores
semantic information to represent scenes more effectively. We also present a
two-step global semantic ICP to obtain the 3D pose (x, y, yaw) used to align
the point cloud to improve matching performance. Our experiments on the KITTI
dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a
large margin. Our code is available at: https://github.com/lilin-hitcrt/SSC.</span>

                                        <span>Identity documents recognition is an important sub-field of document
analysis, which deals with tasks of robust document detection, type
identification, text fields recognition, as well as identity fraud prevention
and document authenticity validation given photos, scans, or video frames of an
identity document capture. Significant amount of research has been published on
this topic in recent years, however a chief difficulty for such research is
scarcity of datasets, due to the subject matter being protected by security
requirements. A few datasets of identity documents which are available lack
diversity of document types, capturing conditions, or variability of document
field values. In addition, the published datasets were typically designed only
for a subset of document recognition problems, not for a complex identity
document analysis. In this paper, we present a dataset MIDV-2020 which consists
of 1000 video clips, 2000 scanned images, and 1000 photos of 1000 unique mock
identity documents, each with unique text field values and unique artificially
generated faces, with rich annotation. For the presented benchmark dataset
baselines are provided for such tasks as document location and identification,
text fields recognition, and face detection. With 72409 annotated images in
total, to the date of publication the proposed dataset is the largest publicly
available identity documents dataset with variable artificially generated data,
and we believe that it will prove invaluable for advancement of the field of
document analysis and recognition. The dataset is available for download at
this ftp URL and this http URL .</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a new dataset for the emotional artificial intelligence
research: identity-free video dataset for Micro-Gesture Understanding and
Emotion analysis (iMiGUE). Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE
focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information,
while the predominant researches of emotion analysis concern sensitive
biometric data, like face and speech. Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on
micro-gestures, i.e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which
are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which
are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore,
iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional
states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just
recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is
because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states
behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of
imbalanced sample distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method
is proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences
themselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this
dataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting
insights from the iMiGUE, e.g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote
emotion understanding. We confirm that the new iMiGUE dataset could advance
studies of micro-gesture and emotion AI.</span>

                                        <span>Benefiting from the powerful expressive capability of graphs, graph-based
approaches have achieved impressive performance in various biomedical
applications. Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among
samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings
for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not
easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the
complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these
factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about
the patient&#x27;s condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction.
To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated
with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate
the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity
between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix
manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured
through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized
with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among
samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable
to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group
of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed
and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In
addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide
more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and
inspiration for disease research.</span>

                                        <span>Processing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly
task, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Therefore, Ai has
become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a
supportive tool for doctors. AI tools highly depend on data for training the
models. However, there are several constraints to access to large amounts of
medical data to train machine learning algorithms in the medical domain, e.g.,
due to privacy concerns and the costly, time-consuming medical data annotation
process. To address this, in this paper we present a novel synthetic data
generation pipeline called SinGAN-Seg to produce synthetic medical data with
the corresponding annotated ground truth masks. We show that these synthetic
data generation pipelines can be used as an alternative to bypass privacy
concerns and as an alternative way to produce artificial segmentation datasets
with corresponding ground truth masks to avoid the tedious medical data
annotation process. As a proof of concept, we used an open polyp segmentation
dataset. By training UNet++ using both the real polyp segmentation dataset and
the corresponding synthetic dataset generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we
show that the synthetic data can achieve a very close performance to the real
data when the real segmentation datasets are large enough. In addition, we show
that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improving the
performance of segmentation algorithms when the training dataset is very small.
Since our SinGAN-Seg pipeline is applicable for any medical dataset, this
pipeline can be used with any other segmentation datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Humans perceive the world by concurrently processing and fusing
high-dimensional inputs from multiple modalities such as vision and audio.
Machine perception models, in stark contrast, are typically modality-specific
and optimised for unimodal benchmarks, and hence late-stage fusion of final
representations or predictions from each modality (&#x60;late-fusion&#x27;) is still a
dominant paradigm for multimodal video classification. Instead, we introduce a
novel transformer based architecture that uses &#x60;fusion bottlenecks&#x27; for
modality fusion at multiple layers. Compared to traditional pairwise
self-attention, our model forces information between different modalities to
pass through a small number of bottleneck latents, requiring the model to
collate and condense the most relevant information in each modality and only
share what is necessary. We find that such a strategy improves fusion
performance, at the same time reducing computational cost. We conduct thorough
ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple audio-visual
classification benchmarks including Audioset, Epic-Kitchens and VGGSound. All
code and models will be released.</span>

such as seeking clarifications about the question, taking advantage of clues,
abstaining in order to avoid incorrect answers, etc. This difference in task
formulation hinders the adoption of NLP systems in real-world settings. In this
work, we take a step towards bridging this gap and present a multi-stage task
that simulates a typical human-human questioner-responder interaction such as
an interview. Specifically, the system is provided with question
simplifications, knowledge statements, examples, etc. at various stages to
improve its prediction when it is not sufficiently confident. We instantiate
the proposed task in Natural Language Inference setting where a system is
evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and find that the multi-stage formulation of our task
leads to OOD generalization performance improvement up to 2.29% in Stage 1,
1.91% in Stage 2, 54.88% in Stage 3, and 72.02% in Stage 4 over the standard
unguided prediction. However, our task leaves a significant challenge for NLP
researchers to further improve OOD performance at each stage.</span>

implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial
attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a
misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet
efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event
sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters
for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two
types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the
filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks.
Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware
Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset
and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean
frames. The source code of all the proposed DVS-Attacks and noise filters is

                                        <span>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from
a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally
attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between
the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher
model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to
mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits
the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper,
we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework
(IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and
exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer
the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model,
while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different
from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is
generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual
learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn
more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general
technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance.
Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the
performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning. The code and
models of IE-KD will be make publicly available at
https://github.com/yellowtownhz/IE-KD.</span>

texture features for the qualitative analysis and classification of chromogenic
in-situ hybridization whole slide images in high-throughput imaging
experiments. The challenge is that currently, the gold standard for gene
expression grading in such images is expert assessment. The idea of the
research team is to use different approaches in the analysis of these images
that will be used for structural segmentation and functional analysis in gene
expression. The article presents such perspective idea to select a number of
textural features that are going to be used for classification. In our
experiment, natural grouping of image samples (tiles) depending on their local
texture properties was explored in an unsupervised classification procedure.
The features are reduced to two dimensions with fuzzy c-means clustering. The
overall conclusion of this experiment is that Haralick features are a viable
choice for classification and analysis of chromogenic in-situ hybridization
image data. The principal component analysis approach produced slightly more
&quot;understandable&quot; from an annotator&#x27;s point of view classes.</span>

such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, search and rescue in
hardly-accessible areas, etc.. While a single drone can be guided by a human
operator, the deployment of a swarm of multiple drones requires proper
algorithms for automatic task-oriented control. In this paper, we focus on
visual coverage optimization with drone-mounted camera sensors. In particular,
we consider the specific case in which the coverage requirements are uneven,
meaning that different parts of the environment have different coverage
priorities. We model these coverage requirements with relevance maps and
propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to guide the swarm. The paper
first defines a proper learning model for a single drone, and then extends it
to the case of multiple drones both with greedy and cooperative strategies.
Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method, also compared
with a standard patrolling algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>While many real-world data streams imply that they change frequently in a
nonstationary way, most of deep learning methods optimize neural networks on
training data, and this leads to severe performance degradation when dataset
shift happens. However, it is less possible to annotate or inspect newly
streamed data by humans, and thus it is desired to measure model drift at
inference time in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a novel
method of model drift estimation by exploiting statistics of batch
normalization layer on unlabeled test data. To remedy possible sampling error
of streamed input data, we adopt low-rank approximation to each
representational layer. We show the effectiveness of our method not only on
dataset shift detection but also on model selection when there are multiple
candidate models among model zoo or training trajectories in an unsupervised
way. We further demonstrate the consistency of our method by comparing model
drift scores between different network architectures.</span>

                                        <span>In real-world applications, data often come in a growing manner, where the
data volume and the number of classes may increase dynamically. This will bring
a critical challenge for learning: given the increasing data volume or the
number of classes, one has to instantaneously adjust the neural model capacity
to obtain promising performance. Existing methods either ignore the growing
nature of data or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a
given dataset, and thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures
for the changed data. To address this, we present a neural architecture
adaptation method, namely Adaptation eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust
previous architectures on the growing data. Specifically, we introduce an
architecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture for each data
snapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent between
current and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation
condition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding
unnecessary and time-consuming adjustments. Extensive experiments on two growth
scenarios (increasing data volume and number of classes) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

networks on an octree data representation. We train a hierarchy of neural
networks, each capable of 2x upscaling in each spatial dimension between two
levels of detail, and use these networks in tandem to facilitate large scale
factor super resolution, scaling with the number of trained networks. We
utilize these networks in a hierarchical super resolution algorithm that
upscales multiresolution data to a uniform high resolution without introducing
seam artifacts on octree node boundaries. We evaluate application of this
algorithm in a data reduction framework by dynamically downscaling input data
to an octree-based data structure to represent the multiresolution data before
compressing for additional storage reduction. We demonstrate that our approach
avoids seam artifacts common to multiresolution data formats, and show how

first exploited a recent Domain Generalization (DG) technique, called Relative
Norm Alignment (RNA). It consists in designing a model able to generalize well
to any unseen domain, regardless of the possibility to access target data at
training time. Then, in a second phase, we extended the approach to work on
unlabelled target data, allowing the model to adapt to the target distribution
in an unsupervised fashion. For this purpose, we included in our framework
existing UDA algorithms, such as Temporal Attentive Adversarial Adaptation
Network (TA3N), jointly with new multi-stream consistency losses, namely
Temporal Hard Norm Alignment (T-HNA) and Min-Entropy Consistency (MEC). Our

                                        <span>Modern top-performing object detectors depend heavily on backbone networks,
whose advances bring consistent performance gains through exploring more
effective network structures. However, designing or searching for a new
backbone and pre-training it on ImageNet may require a large number of
computational resources, making it costly to obtain better detection
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel backbone network, namely
CBNetV2, by constructing compositions of existing open-sourced pre-trained
backbones. In particular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple identical
backbones, which are connected through composite connections. We also propose a
better training strategy with the Assistant Supervision for CBNet-based
detectors. Without additional pre-training, CBNetV2 can be integrated into
mainstream detectors, including one-stage and two-stage detectors, as well as
anchor-based and anchor-free-based ones, and significantly improve their
performance by more than 3.0% AP over the baseline on COCO. Also, experiments
provide strong evidence showing that composite backbones are more efficient and
resource-friendly than pre-trained wider and deeper networks, including
manual-based and NAS-based, as well as CNN-based and Transformer-based ones.
Particularly, with single-model and single-scale testing, our HTC Dual-Swin-B
achieves 58.6% box AP and 51.1% mask AP on COCO test-dev, which is
significantly better than the state-of-the-art result (i.e., 57.7% box AP and
50.2% mask AP) achieved by a stronger baseline HTC++ with a larger backbone
Swin-L. Code will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/CBNetV2.</span>

                                        <span>Reconstructing the scene of robotic surgery from the stereo endoscopic video
is an important and promising topic in surgical data science, which potentially
supports many applications such as surgical visual perception, robotic surgery
education and intra-operative context awareness. However, current methods are
mostly restricted to reconstructing static anatomy assuming no tissue
deformation, tool occlusion and de-occlusion, and camera movement. However,
these assumptions are not always satisfied in minimal invasive robotic
surgeries. In this work, we present an efficient reconstruction pipeline for
highly dynamic surgical scenes that runs at 28 fps. Specifically, we design a
transformer-based stereoscopic depth perception for efficient depth estimation
and a light-weight tool segmentor to handle tool occlusion. After that, a
dynamic reconstruction algorithm which can estimate the tissue deformation and
camera movement, and aggregate the information over time is proposed for
surgical scene reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on two
datasets, the public Hamlyn Centre Endoscopic Video Dataset and our in-house
DaVinci robotic surgery dataset. The results demonstrate that our method can
recover the scene obstructed by the surgical tool and handle the movement of
camera in realistic surgical scenarios effectively at real-time speed.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, deep hashing with Hamming distance metric has drawn increasing
attention for face image retrieval tasks. However, its counterpart deep
quantization methods, which learn binary code representations with
dictionary-related distance metrics, have seldom been explored for the task.
This paper makes the first attempt to integrate product quantization into an
end-to-end deep learning framework for face image retrieval. Unlike prior deep
quantization methods where the codewords for quantization are learned from
data, we propose a novel scheme using predefined orthonormal vectors as
codewords, which aims to enhance the quantization informativeness and reduce
the codewords&#x27; redundancy. To make the most of the discriminative information,
we design a tailored loss function that maximizes the identity discriminability
in each quantization subspace for both the quantized and the original features.
Furthermore, an entropy-based regularization term is imposed to reduce the
quantization error. We conduct experiments on three commonly-used datasets
under the settings of both single-domain and cross-domain retrieval. It shows
that the proposed method outperforms all the compared deep hashing/quantization
methods under both settings with significant superiority. The proposed
codewords scheme consistently improves both regular model performance and model
generalization ability, verifying the importance of codewords&#x27; distribution for
the quantization quality. Besides, our model&#x27;s better generalization ability
than deep hashing models indicates that it is more suitable for scalable face
image retrieval tasks.</span>

                                        <span>This work is to tackle the problem of point cloud semantic segmentation for
3D hybrid scenes under the framework of zero-shot learning. Here by hybrid, we
mean the scene consists of both seen-class and unseen-class 3D objects, a more
general and realistic setting in application. To our knowledge, this problem
has not been explored in the literature. To this end, we propose a network to
synthesize point features for various classes of objects by leveraging the
semantic features of both seen and unseen object classes, called PFNet. The
proposed PFNet employs a GAN architecture to synthesize point features, where
the semantic relationship between seen-class and unseen-class features is
consolidated by adapting a new semantic regularizer, and the synthesized
features are used to train a classifier for predicting the labels of the
testing 3D scene points. Besides we also introduce two benchmarks for
algorithmic evaluation by re-organizing the public S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
under six different data splits. Experimental results on the two benchmarks
validate our proposed method, and we hope our introduced two benchmarks and
methodology could be of help for more research on this new direction.</span>

methods. In this paper, we methodically evaluate a variety of these techniques
to understand where most of the improvements in modern detection systems come
from. We benchmark these improvements on the vanilla ResNet-FPN backbone with
RetinaNet and RCNN detectors. The vanilla detectors are improved by 7.7% in

strategies to generate family of models that form two Pareto curves, named
RetinaNet-RS and Cascade RCNN-RS. These simple rescaled detectors explore the
speed-accuracy trade-off between the one-stage RetinaNet detectors and
two-stage RCNN detectors. Our largest Cascade RCNN-RS models achieve 52.9% AP

                                        <span>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a strong classifier using limited
labeled examples. Many existing works take the meta-learning approach, sampling
few-shot tasks in turn and optimizing the few-shot learner&#x27;s performance on
classifying the query examples. In this paper, we point out two potential
weaknesses of this approach. First, the sampled query examples may not provide
sufficient supervision for the few-shot learner. Second, the effectiveness of
meta-learning diminishes sharply with increasing shots (i.e., the number of
training examples per class). To resolve these issues, we propose a novel
objective to directly train the few-shot learner to perform like a strong
classifier. Concretely, we associate each sampled few-shot task with a strong
classifier, which is learned with ample labeled examples. The strong classifier
has a better generalization ability and we use it to supervise the few-shot
learner. We present an efficient way to construct the strong classifier, making
our proposed objective an easily plug-and-play term to existing meta-learning
based FSL methods. We validate our approach in combinations with many
representative meta-learning methods. On several benchmark datasets including
miniImageNet and tiredImageNet, our approach leads to a notable improvement
across a variety of tasks. More importantly, with our approach, meta-learning
based FSL methods can consistently outperform non-meta-learning based ones,
even in a many-shot setting, greatly strengthening their applicability.</span>

                                        <span>We study computational hardness of feature and conjunction search through the
lens of circuit complexity. Let $x &#x3D; (x_1, ... , x_n)$ (resp., $y &#x3D; (y_1, ... ,
y_n)$) be Boolean variables each of which takes the value one if and only if a
neuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply
formulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\rm
FTR}_n(x) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i$ and ${\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i
\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).

We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed &#x3D; o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.</span>

capture the eating episodes of a subject, recording rich visual information,
such as the type and volume of food being consumed, as well as the eating
behaviours of the subject. However, there currently is no method that is able
to incorporate these visual clues and provide a comprehensive context of
dietary intake from passive recording (e.g., is the subject sharing food with
others, what food the subject is eating, and how much food is left in the
bowl). On the other hand, privacy is a major concern while egocentric wearable
cameras are used for capturing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserved
secure solution (i.e., egocentric image captioning) for dietary assessment with
passive monitoring, which unifies food recognition, volume estimation, and
scene understanding. By converting images into rich text descriptions,
nutritionists can assess individual dietary intake based on the captions
instead of the original images, reducing the risk of privacy leakage from
images. To this end, an egocentric dietary image captioning dataset has been
built, which consists of in-the-wild images captured by head-worn and
chest-worn cameras in field studies in Ghana. A novel transformer-based
architecture is designed to caption egocentric dietary images. Comprehensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify
the design of the proposed architecture for egocentric dietary image
captioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies
image captioning to dietary intake assessment in real life settings.</span>

problems, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of machine learning
and deep learning for the analysis of digital pathology and biopsy image
patches. However, traditional learning over patch-wise features using
convolutional neural networks limits the model when attempting to capture
global contextual information. The phenotypical and topological distribution of
constituent histological entities play a critical role in tissue diagnosis. As
such, graph data representations and deep learning have attracted significant
attention for encoding tissue representations, and capturing intra- and inter-
entity level interactions. In this review, we provide a conceptual grounding of
graph-based deep learning and discuss its current success for tumor
localization and classification, tumor invasion and staging, image retrieval,
and survival prediction. We provide an overview of these methods in a
systematic manner organized by the graph representation of the input image
including whole slide images and tissue microarrays. We also outline the

distribution with the unlabeled target distribution to obtain domain invariant
predictive models. However, the application of well-known UDA approaches does
not generalize well in Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) scenarios where
few labeled samples from the target domain are available. In this paper, we
propose a simple Contrastive Learning framework for semi-supervised Domain
Adaptation (CLDA) that attempts to bridge the intra-domain gap between the
labeled and unlabeled target distributions and inter-domain gap between source
and unlabeled target distribution in SSDA. We suggest employing class-wise
contrastive learning to reduce the inter-domain gap and instance-level
contrastive alignment between the original (input image) and strongly augmented
unlabeled target images to minimize the intra-domain discrepancy. We have shown
empirically that both of these modules complement each other to achieve
superior performance. Experiments on three well-known domain adaptation
benchmark datasets namely DomainNet, Office-Home, and Office31 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. CLDA achieves state-of-the-art results on all

for selection of most informative frames (key frames) of an endoscopic video.
In most of the cases, ground truth depth maps of polyps are not readily
available and that is why the transfer learning approach is adopted in our
method. An endoscopic modalities generally capture thousands of frames. In this
scenario, it is quite important to discard low-quality and clinically
irrelevant frames of an endoscopic video while the most informative frames
should be retained for clinical diagnosis. In this view, a key-frame selection
strategy is proposed by utilizing the depth information of polyps. In our
method, image moment, edge magnitude, and key-points are considered for
adaptively selecting the key frames. One important application of our proposed
method could be the 3D reconstruction of polyps with the help of extracted key
frames. Also, polyps are localized with the help of extracted depth maps.</span>

the past few Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in the
world. In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches
have been used to detect and grade DR. Early detection enables appropriate
treatment and thus prevents vision loss, Both fundus and optical coherence
tomography (OCT) images are used to image the retina. With deep
learning/machine learning apprroaches it is possible to extract features from
the images and detect the presence of DR. Multiple strategies are implemented
to detect and grade the presence of DR using classification, segmentation, and
hybrid techniques. This review covers the literature dealing with AI approaches
to DR that have been published in the open literature over a five year span
(2016-2021). In addition a comprehensive list of available DR datasets is
reported. Both the PICO (P-patient, I-intervention, C-control O-outcome) and
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)2009
search strategies were employed. We summarize a total of 114 published articles

                                        <span>Visual localization is one of the most important components for robotics and
autonomous driving. Recently, inspiring results have been shown with CNN-based
methods which provide a direct formulation to end-to-end regress 6-DoF absolute
pose. Additional information like geometric or semantic constraints is
generally introduced to improve performance. Especially, the latter can
aggregate high-level semantic information into localization task, but it
usually requires enormous manual annotations. To this end, we propose a novel
auxiliary learning strategy for camera localization by introducing
scene-specific high-level semantics from self-supervised representation
learning task. Viewed as a powerful proxy task, image colorization task is
chosen as complementary task that outputs pixel-wise color version of grayscale
photograph without extra annotations. In our work, feature representations from
colorization network are embedded into localization network by design to
produce discriminative features for pose regression. Meanwhile an attention
mechanism is introduced for the benefit of localization performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model significantly improve localization accuracy
over state-of-the-arts on both indoor and outdoor datasets.</span>

                                        <span>For steel product manufacturing in indoor factories, steel defect detection
is important for quality control. For example, a steel sheet is extremely
delicate, and must be accurately inspected. However, to maintain the painted
steel parts of the infrastructure around a severe outdoor environment,
corrosion detection is critical for predictive maintenance. In this paper, we
propose a general-purpose application for steel anomaly detection that consists
of the following four components. The first, a learner, is a unit image
classification network to determine whether the region of interest or
background has been recognised, after dividing the original large sized image
into 256 square unit images. The second, an extractor, is a discriminator
feature encoder based on a pre-trained steel generator with a patch generative
adversarial network discriminator(GAN). The third, an anomaly detector, is a
one-class support vector machine(SVM) to predict the anomaly score using the
discriminator feature. The fourth, an indicator, is an anomalous probability
map used to visually explain the anomalous features. Furthermore, we
demonstrated our method through the inspection of steel sheet defects with
13,774 unit images using high-speed cameras, and painted steel corrosion with
19,766 unit images based on an eye inspection of the photographs. Finally, we
visualise anomalous feature maps of steel using a strip and painted steel
inspection dataset</span>

surroundings, e.g., through semantic segmentation of LiDAR sequences, which
experienced a remarkable progress due to the release of large datasets such as
SemanticKITTI and nuScenes-LidarSeg. While most previous works focus on sparse
segmentation of the LiDAR input, dense output masks provide self-driving cars
with almost complete environment information. In this paper, we introduce MASS
- a Multi-Attentional Semantic Segmentation model specifically built for dense
top-view understanding of the driving scenes. Our framework operates on pillar-
and occupancy features and comprises three attention-based building blocks: (1)
a keypoint-driven graph attention, (2) an LSTM-based attention computed from a
vector embedding of the spatial input, and (3) a pillar-based attention,
resulting in a dense 360-degree segmentation mask. With extensive experiments
on both, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes-LidarSeg, we quantitatively demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model, outperforming the state of the art by 19.0% on
SemanticKITTI and reaching 32.7% in mIoU on nuScenes-LidarSeg, where MASS is
the first work addressing the dense segmentation task. Furthermore, our
multi-attention model is shown to be very effective for 3D object detection
validated on the KITTI-3D dataset, showcasing its high generalizability to
other tasks related to 3D vision.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have
been applied to various sequence learning tasks with great success. Following
this, these models are increasingly replacing classic approaches in object
tracking applications for motion prediction. On the one hand, these models can
capture complex object dynamics with less modeling required, but on the other
hand, they depend on a large amount of training data for parameter tuning.
Towards this end, we present an approach for generating synthetic trajectory
data of unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) in image space. Since UAVs, or rather
quadrotors are dynamical systems, they can not follow arbitrary trajectories.
With the prerequisite that UAV trajectories fulfill a smoothness criterion
corresponding to a minimal change of higher-order motion, methods for planning
aggressive quadrotors flights can be utilized to generate optimal trajectories
through a sequence of 3D waypoints. By projecting these maneuver trajectories,
which are suitable for controlling quadrotors, to image space, a versatile
trajectory data set is realized. To demonstrate the applicability of the
synthetic trajectory data, we show that an RNN-based prediction model solely
trained on the generated data can outperform classic reference models on a
real-world UAV tracking dataset. The evaluation is done on the publicly
available ANTI-UAV dataset.</span>

                                        <span>The online recruitment matching system has been the core technology and
service platform in CareerBuilder. One of the major challenges in an online
recruitment scenario is to provide good matches between job posts and
candidates using a recommender system on the scale. In this paper, we discussed
the techniques for applying an embedding-based recommender system for the large
scale of job to candidates matching. To learn the comprehensive and effective
embedding for job posts and candidates, we have constructed a fused-embedding
via different levels of representation learning from raw text, semantic
entities and location information. The clusters of fused-embedding of job and
candidates are then used to build and train the Faiss index that supports
runtime approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate retrieval. After the
first stage of candidate retrieval, a second stage reranking model that
utilizes other contextual information was used to generate the final matching
result. Both offline and online evaluation results indicate a significant
improvement of our proposed two-staged embedding-based system in terms of
click-through rate (CTR), quality and normalized discounted accumulated gain
(nDCG), compared to those obtained from our baseline system. We further
described the deployment of the system that supports the million-scale job and
candidate matching process at CareerBuilder. The overall improvement of our job
to candidate matching system has demonstrated its feasibility and scalability
at a major online recruitment site.</span>

Science, Google Scholar etc. are accessed for evaluating the trend of
publications and citations from time to time. Some of these databases are free
and some are subscription based. Its always debatable that which bibliographic
database is better and in what terms. To provide an optimal solution to
availability of multiple bibliographic databases, we have implemented a single
authentic database named as &#x60;&#x60;conflate&#x27;&#x27; which can be used for fetching
publication and citation trend of an author. To further strengthen the
generated database and to provide the transparent system to the stakeholders, a
consensus mechanism &#x60;&#x60;proof of reference (PoR)&#x27;&#x27; is proposed. Due to three
consent based checks implemented in PoR, we feel that it could be considered as
a authentic and honest citation data source for the calculation of unified
informetrics for an author.</span>

                                        <span>Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely used to characterize
entities of various types and their complex relations. Recent attempts either
rely on explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness
or graph neighborhood to learn heterogeneous network representations before
predictions. These weakly coupled manners overlook the rich interactions among
neighbor nodes, which introduces an early summarization issue. In this paper,
we propose GraphHINGE (Heterogeneous INteract and aggreGatE), which captures
and aggregates the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through
their structured neighborhoods. Specifically, we first introduce
Neighborhood-based Interaction (NI) module to model the interactive patterns
under the same metapaths, and then extend it to Cross Neighborhood-based
Interaction (CNI) module to deal with different metapaths. Next, in order to
address the complexity issue on large-scale networks, we formulate the
interaction modules via a convolutional framework and learn the parameters
efficiently with fast Fourier transform. Furthermore, we design a novel
neighborhood-based selection (NS) mechanism, a sampling strategy, to filter
high-order neighborhood information based on their low-order performance. The
extensive experiments on six different types of heterogeneous graphs
demonstrate the performance gains by comparing with state-of-the-arts in both
click-through rate prediction and top-N recommendation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Pseudo-relevance feedback mechanisms, from Rocchio to the relevance models,
have shown the usefulness of expanding and reweighting the users&#x27; initial
queries using information occurring in an initial set of retrieved documents,
known as the pseudo-relevant set. Recently, dense retrieval -- through the use
of neural contextual language models such as BERT for analysing the documents&#x27;
and queries&#x27; contents and computing their relevance scores -- has shown a
promising performance on several information retrieval tasks still relying on
the traditional inverted index for identifying documents relevant to a query.
Two different dense retrieval families have emerged: the use of single embedded
representations for each passage and query (e.g. using BERT&#x27;s [CLS] token), or
via multiple representations (e.g. using an embedding for each token of the
query and document). In this work, we conduct the first study into the
potential for multiple representation dense retrieval to be enhanced using
pseudo-relevance feedback. In particular, based on the pseudo-relevant set of
documents identified using a first-pass dense retrieval, we extract
representative feedback embeddings (using KMeans clustering) -- while ensuring
that these embeddings discriminate among passages (based on IDF) -- which are
then added to the query representation. These additional feedback embeddings
are shown to both enhance the effectiveness of a reranking as well as an
additional dense retrieval operation. Indeed, experiments on the MSMARCO
passage ranking dataset show that MAP can be improved by upto 26% on the TREC
2019 query set and 10% on the TREC 2020 query set by the application of our
proposed ColBERT-PRF method on a ColBERT dense retrieval approach.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment quantification is the task of estimating the relative frequency (or
&quot;prevalence&quot;) of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral,
Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts; this is especially important when
these texts are tweets, since most sentiment classification endeavours carried
out on Twitter data actually have quantification (and not the classification of
individual tweets) as their ultimate goal. It is well-known that solving
quantification via &quot;classify and count&quot; (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled
items via a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned
to a given class) is suboptimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate
quantification methods exist. In 2016, Gao and Sebastiani carried out a
systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment
quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimental protocol
followed in that work is flawed, and that its results are thus unreliable. We
now re-evaluate those quantification methods on the very same datasets, this
time following a now consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol,
that involves 5775 as many experiments as run in the original study. Our
experimentation yields results dramatically different from those obtained by
Gao and Sebastiani, and thus provide a different, much more solid understanding
of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.</span>

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs

                                        <span>Deep learning-based techniques have been widely applied to the program
analysis tasks, in fields such as type inference, fault localization, and code
summarization. Hitherto deep learning-based software engineering systems rely
thoroughly on supervised learning approaches, which require laborious manual
effort to collect and label a prohibitively large amount of data. However, most
Turing-complete imperative languages share similar control- and data-flow
structures, which make it possible to transfer knowledge learned from one
language to another. In this paper, we propose cross-lingual adaptation of
program analysis, which allows us to leverage prior knowledge learned from the
labeled dataset of one language and transfer it to the others. Specifically, we
implemented a cross-lingual adaptation framework, PLATO, to transfer a deep
learning-based type inference procedure across weakly typed languages, e.g.,
Python to JavaScript and vice versa. PLATO incorporates a novel joint graph
kernelized attention based on abstract syntax tree and control flow graph, and
applies anchor word augmentation across different languages. Besides, by
leveraging data from strongly typed languages, PLATO improves the perplexity of
the backbone cross-programming-language model and the performance of downstream
cross-lingual transfer for type inference. Experimental results illustrate that
our framework significantly improves the transferability over the baseline
method by a large margin.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal VAEs seek to model the joint distribution over heterogeneous data
(e.g.\ vision, language), whilst also capturing a shared representation across
such modalities. Prior work has typically combined information from the
modalities by reconciling idiosyncratic representations directly in the
recognition model through explicit products, mixtures, or other such
factorisations. Here we introduce a novel alternative, the MEME, that avoids
such explicit combinations by repurposing semi-supervised VAEs to combine
information between modalities implicitly through mutual supervision. This
formulation naturally allows learning from partially-observed data where some
modalities can be entirely missing -- something that most existing approaches
either cannot handle, or do so to a limited extent. We demonstrate that MEME
outperforms baselines on standard metrics across both partial and complete
observation schemes on the MNIST-SVHN (image-image) and CUB (image-text)
datasets. We also contrast the quality of the representations learnt by mutual
supervision against standard approaches and observe interesting trends in its
ability to capture relatedness between data.</span>

although there are some correlation analysis of features based on covariance,
there is no relevant research on exploring structural feature correlation on
graphs with graph neural network based models. In this paper, we introduce
graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional
space to explore some preliminary results on structural feature correlation,
which is based on graph neural network. The results show that there exists high
correlation between some of the structural features. A redundant feature
combination with initial node features, which is filtered by graph neural
network has improved its classification accuracy in some graph datasets. We
compare the difference between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings
between features and show that the simplest is the best. We generalize on the

                                        <span>We consider a class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) problem. While
some recently proposed algorithms utilized variants of knowledge distillation
(KD) technique to tackle the problem, they only partially addressed the key
additional challenges in CISS that causes the catastrophic forgetting; i.e.,
the semantic drift of the background class and multi-label prediction issue. To
better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M
(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining
several techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we
make three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background
class to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone
network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling
to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny
exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and
stability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better
performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough and
extensive ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem

                                        <span>Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental research task in digital text
forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the
same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that
focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first
category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features,
where one has full control over which features are considered and what they
actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV
methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control
mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a
potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear
the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions,
which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To
tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise,
which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV
methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the
writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into
the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better
results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases,
with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%.</span>

explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image,
while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to
high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of
latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the
refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of
compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic
transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows
flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of
the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model&#x27;s strength and
robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from
simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor
scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality

                                        <span>Through solving pretext tasks, self-supervised learning (SSL) leverages
unlabeled data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional
input features in the downstream task. A common pretext task consists in
pretraining a SSL model on pseudo-labels derived from the original signal. This
technique is particularly relevant for speech data where various meaningful
signal processing features may serve as pseudo-labels. However, the process of
selecting pseudo-labels, for speech or other types of data, remains mostly
unexplored and currently relies on observing the results on the final
downstream task. Nevertheless, this methodology is not sustainable at scale due
to substantial computational (hence carbon) costs. Thus, this paper introduces
a practical and theoretical framework to select relevant pseudo-labels with
respect to a given downstream task. More precisely, we propose a functional
estimator of the pseudo-label utility grounded in the conditional independence
theory, which does not require any training. The experiments conducted on
speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition validate our estimator,
showing a significant correlation between the performance observed on the
downstream task and the utility estimates obtained with our approach,
facilitating the prospection of relevant pseudo-labels for self-supervised
speech representation learning.</span>

their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from
high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their
exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of
modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex
cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to
deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack
of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their
general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted
features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding
the vector space before the NNs&#x27; output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten
the deep feature vectors&#x27; properties under classification tasks. Main attention
is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse
effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived
from our model&#x27;s formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition
scenarios, proving its prominence by improving the obtained results.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning and pre-training strategies have developed over the
last few years especially for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Recently
application of such methods can also be noticed for Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) . In this paper, we have used a graph based self-supervised learning
strategy with different loss functions (Barlow Twins[Zbontar et al., 2021],
HSIC[Tsai et al., 2021], VICReg[Bardes et al., 2021]) which have shown
promising results when applied with CNNs previously. We have also proposed a
hybrid loss function combining the advantages of VICReg and HSIC and called it
as VICRegHSIC. The performance of these aforementioned methods have been
compared when applied to different datasets such as MUTAG, PROTEINS and
IMDB-Binary. Moreover, the impact of different batch sizes, projector
dimensions and data augmentation strategies have also been explored</span>

Hyperboxes, constructed from individual hyperbox-based classifiers trained on
the random subsets of sample and feature spaces of the training set. We also
show a generalization error bound of the proposed classifier based on the

analyzed using a carefully selected illustrative example and compared
empirically with other popular single and ensemble classifiers via 20 datasets

proposed method outperformed other fuzzy min-max neural networks, popular

                                        <span>Search-based test generation is guided by feedback from one or more fitness
functions -- scoring functions that judge solution optimality. Choosing
informative fitness functions is crucial to meeting the goals of a tester.
Unfortunately, many goals - such as forcing the class-under-test to throw
exceptions, increasing test suite diversity, and attaining Strong Mutation
Coverage - do not have effective fitness function formulations. We propose that
meeting such goals requires treating fitness function identification as a
secondary optimization step. An adaptive algorithm that can vary the selection
of fitness functions could adjust its selection throughout the generation
process to maximize goal attainment, based on the current population of test
suites. To test this hypothesis, we have implemented two reinforcement learning
algorithms in the EvoSuite unit test generation framework, and used these
algorithms to dynamically set the fitness functions used during generation for
the three goals identified above.

We have evaluated our framework, EvoSuiteFIT, on a set of Java case examples.
EvoSuiteFIT techniques attain significant improvements for two of the three
goals, and show limited improvements on the third when the number of
generations of evolution is fixed. Additionally, for two of the three goals,
EvoSuiteFIT detects faults missed by the other techniques. The ability to
adjust fitness functions allows strategic choices that efficiently produce more
effective test suites, and examining these choices offers insight into how to
attain our testing goals. We find that adaptive fitness function selection is a
powerful technique to apply when an effective fitness function does not already
exist for achieving a testing goal.</span>

important problem in fashion e-commerce: color variants identification, i.e.,
identifying fashion products that match exactly in their design (or style), but
only to differ in their color. At first we attempt to tackle the problem by
obtaining manual annotations (depicting whether two products are color
variants), and train a supervised triplet loss based neural network model to
learn representations of fashion products. However, for large scale real-world
industrial datasets such as addressed in our paper, it is infeasible to obtain
annotations for the entire dataset, while capturing all the difficult corner
cases. Interestingly, we observed that color variants are essentially
manifestations of color jitter based augmentations. Thus, we instead explore
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to solve this problem. We observed that existing
state-of-the-art SSL methods perform poor, for our problem. To address this, we
propose a novel SSL based color variants model that simultaneously focuses on
different parts of an apparel. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows
that our method outperforms existing SSL methods, and at times, the supervised
model.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range
of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as &quot;black-box&quot; and lack of
interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an
intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most
existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while
neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we
focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by
cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable
CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to
only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse
Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few)
class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter&#x27;s activation to pass only
when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and
highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger
interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our
model displays benefits in applications like object localization and
adversarial sample detection. Code link: https://github.com/hyliang96/CSGCNN.</span>

optimizing the physical layer of wireless communications by defining different
class of problems and the possible solutions to handle them. In Section 9.2, we
present all the basic theory needed to address a RL problem, i.e. Markov
decision process (MDP), Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP),
but also two very important and widely used algorithms for RL, i.e. the
Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. We also introduce the deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) paradigm and the section ends with an introduction to the
multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework. Section 9.3 focuses on some toy examples
to illustrate how the basic concepts of RL are employed in communication
systems. We present applications extracted from literature with simplified
system models using similar notation as in Section 9.2 of this Chapter. In
Section 9.3, we also focus on modeling RL problems, i.e. how action and state
spaces and rewards are chosen. The Chapter is concluded in Section 9.4 with a
prospective thought on RL trends and it ends with a review of a broader state
of the art in Section 9.5.</span>

finite sample. We prove that the metric space defined by the sample endowed
with a computable metric known as sample Fermat distance converges a.s. in the
sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. The limiting object is the manifold itself endowed
with the population Fermat distance, an intrinsic metric that accounts for both
the geometry of the manifold and the density that produces the sample. This
result is applied to obtain intrinsic persistence diagrams, which are less
sensitive to the particular embedding of the manifold in the Euclidean space.
We show that this approach is robust to outliers and deduce a method for
pattern recognition in signals, with applications in real data.</span>

state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms include no considerations
for exploration beyond maximizing the entropy of the policy. In this work we
address this seeming missed opportunity. We observe that the most common
formulation of directed exploration in deep RL, known as bonus-based
exploration (BBE), suffers from bias and slow coverage in the few-sample
regime. This causes BBE to be actively detrimental to policy learning in many
control tasks. We show that by decoupling the task policy from the exploration
policy, directed exploration can be highly effective for sample-efficient
continuous control. Our method, Decoupled Exploration and Exploitation Policies
(DEEP), can be combined with any off-policy RL algorithm without modification.
When used in conjunction with soft actor-critic, DEEP incurs no performance
penalty in densely-rewarding environments. On sparse environments, DEEP gives a
several-fold improvement in data efficiency due to better exploration.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, it is growing interest to make Machine Learning (ML) systems more
understandable and trusting to general users. Thus, generating explanations for
ML system behaviours that are understandable to human beings is a central
scientific and technological issue addressed by the rapidly growing research
area of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recently, it is becoming
more and more evident that new directions to create better explanations should
take into account what a good explanation is to a human user, and consequently,
develop XAI solutions able to provide user-centred explanations. This paper
suggests taking advantage of developing an XAI general approach that allows
producing explanations for an ML system behaviour in terms of different and
user-selected input features, i.e., explanations composed of input properties
that the human user can select according to his background knowledge and goals.
To this end, we propose an XAI general approach which is able: 1) to construct
explanations in terms of input features that represent more salient and
understandable input properties for a user, which we call here Middle-Level
input Features (MLFs), 2) to be applied to different types of MLFs. We
experimentally tested our approach on two different datasets and using three
different types of MLFs. The results seem encouraging.</span>

several domains, relying on minimal architectural priors from the designer. In
Human Action Recognition (HAR), attention mechanisms have been primarily
adopted on top of standard convolutional or recurrent layers, improving the
overall generalization capability. In this work, we introduce Action
Transformer (AcT), a simple, fully self-attentional architecture that
consistently outperforms more elaborated networks that mix convolutional,
recurrent, and attentive layers. In order to limit computational and energy
requests, building on previous human action recognition research, the proposed
approach exploits 2D pose representations over small temporal windows,
providing a low latency solution for accurate and effective real-time
performance. Moreover, we open-source MPOSE2021, a new large-scale dataset, as
an attempt to build a formal training and evaluation benchmark for real-time
short-time human action recognition. Extensive experimentation on MPOSE2021
with our proposed methodology and several previous architectural solutions
proves the effectiveness of the AcT model and poses the base for future work on
HAR.</span>

                                        <span>Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) allows to analyze binary data by deriving
concepts and ordering them in lattices. One of the main goals of FCA is to
enable humans to comprehend the information that is encapsulated in the data;
however, the large size of concept lattices is a limiting factor for the
feasibility of understanding the underlying structural properties. The size of
such a lattice depends on the number of subcontexts in the corresponding formal
context that are isomorphic to a contranominal scale of high dimension. In this
work, we propose the algorithm ContraFinder that enables the computation of all
contranominal scales of a given formal context. Leveraging this algorithm, we
introduce delta-adjusting, a novel approach in order to decrease the number of
contranominal scales in a formal context by the selection of an appropriate
attribute subset. We demonstrate that delta-adjusting a context reduces the
size of the hereby emerging sub-semilattice and that the implication set is
restricted to meaningful implications. This is evaluated with respect to its
associated knowledge by means of a classification task. Hence, our proposed
technique strongly improves understandability while preserving important
conceptual structures.</span>

vehicle coordination can be modeled as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) tasks. QMIX, a widely popular MARL algorithm, has been used as a
baseline for the benchmark environments, e.g., Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC), Difficulty-Enhanced Predator-Prey (DEPP). Recent variants of QMIX
target relaxing the monotonicity constraint of QMIX, allowing for performance
improvement in SMAC. In this paper, we investigate the code-level optimizations
of these variants and the monotonicity constraint. (1) We find that such
improvements of the variants are significantly affected by various code-level
optimizations. (2) The experiment results show that QMIX with normalized
optimizations outperforms other works in SMAC; (3) beyond the common wisdom
from these works, the monotonicity constraint can improve sample efficiency in
SMAC and DEPP. We also discuss why monotonicity constraints work well in purely
cooperative tasks with a theoretical analysis. We open-source the code at

deterministic CR inequality is derived from Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence.
We show that this framework could be generalized to other CR type inequalities
through four examples: $\alpha$-version of CR inequality, generalized CR
inequality, Bayesian CR inequality, and Bayesian $\alpha$-CR inequality. These
are obtained from, respectively, $I_\alpha$-divergence (or relative

linear contextual bandits, where a decision maker can only adapt decisions at a
batch level. In particular, the decision maker, only observing rewards at the
end of each batch, dynamically decides how many individuals to include in the
next batch (at the current batch&#x27;s end) and what personalized action-selection
scheme to adopt within the batch. Such batch constraints are ubiquitous in a
variety of practical contexts, including personalized product offerings in
marketing and medical treatment selection in clinical trials. We characterize
the fundamental learning limit in this problem via a novel lower bound analysis
and provide a simple, exploration-free algorithm that uses the LASSO estimator,
which achieves the minimax optimal performance characterized by the lower bound
(up to log factors). To our best knowledge, our work provides the first inroad
into a rigorous understanding of dynamic batch learning with high-dimensional
covariates. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on both synthetic
data and the Warfarin medical dosing data. The empirical results show that with
three batches (hence only two opportunities to adapt), our algorithm already
performs comparably (in terms of statistical performance) to the
state-of-the-art fully online high-dimensional linear contextual bandits
algorithm. As an added bonus, since our algorithm operates in batches, it is
orders of magnitudes faster than fully online learning algorithms. As such, our
algorithm provides a desirable candidate for practical data-driven personalized
decision making problems, where limited adaptivity is often a hard constraint.</span>

each holding a $d$-dimensional function $f_i$, aim to jointly minimise the sum
of the functions $\sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^N f_i (x)$. This problem arises naturally in
large-scale distributed optimisation, where a standard solution is to apply
variants of (stochastic) gradient descent. We focus on the communication
complexity of this problem: our main result provides the first fully
unconditional bounds on total number of bits which need to be sent and received
by the $N$ machines to solve this problem under point-to-point communication,
within a given error-tolerance. Specifically, we show that $\Omega( Nd \log d /
N\varepsilon)$ total bits need to be communicated between the machines to find
an additive $\epsilon$-approximation to the minimum of $\sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^N f_i
(x)$. The result holds for both deterministic and randomised algorithms, and,
importantly, requires no assumptions on the algorithm structure. The lower
bound is tight under certain restrictions on parameter values, and is matched
within constant factors for quadratic objectives by a new variant of quantised
gradient descent, which we describe and analyse. Our results bring over tools
from communication complexity to distributed optimisation, which has potential
for further applications.</span>

                                        <span>Despite impressive results, deep learning-based technologies also raise
severe privacy and environmental concerns induced by the training procedure
often conducted in datacenters. In response, alternatives to centralized
training such as Federated Learning (FL) have emerged. Perhaps unexpectedly,
FL, in particular, is starting to be deployed at a global scale by companies
that must adhere to new legal demands and policies originating from governments
and civil society for privacy protection. However, the potential environmental
impact related to FL remains unclear and unexplored. This paper offers the
first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of FL. First, we propose a
rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the
investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. Then,
we compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our
findings show that FL, despite being slower to converge in some cases, may
result in a comparatively greener impact than a centralized equivalent setup.
We performed extensive experiments across different types of datasets,
settings, and various deep learning models with FL. Finally, we highlight and
connect the reported results to the future challenges and trends in FL to
reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware
capabilities, and stronger industry transparency.</span>

used for disaster response and crisis management if processed accurately and

using considerable resources during such a crisis is not feasible. Therefore,
we have to develop a low resource and continually learning system that
incorporates text classification models which are robust against noisy and

graphs. Besides of existed neighbor sampling techniques, scalable methods
decoupling graph convolutions and other learnable transformations into
preprocessing and post classifier allow normal minibatch training. By replacing
redundant concatenation operation with attention mechanism in SIGN, we propose
Scalable and Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (SAGN). SAGN can adaptively gather
neighborhood information among different hops. To further improve scalable
models on semi-supervised learning tasks, we propose Self-Label-Enhance (SLE)
framework combining self-training approach and label propagation in depth. We
add base model with a scalable node label module. Then we iteratively train
models and enhance train set in several stages. To generate input of node label
module, we directly apply label propagation based on one-hot encoded label
vectors without inner random masking. We find out that empirically the label
leakage has been effectively alleviated after graph convolutions. The hard
pseudo labels in enhanced train set participate in label propagation with true
labels. Experiments on both inductive and transductive datasets demonstrate
that, compared with other sampling-based and sampling-free methods, SAGN
achieves better or comparable results and SLE can further improve performance.</span>

underlying physical systems to generate higher accuracy results with fewer
data. Such approaches can help drastically reduce the computation time and
generate a good estimate of computationally intensive processes in power
systems, such as dynamic security assessment or optimal power flow. Combined
with the extraction of worst-case guarantees for the neural network
performance, such neural networks can be applied in safety-critical
applications in power systems and build a high level of trust among power
system operators. This paper takes the first step and applies, for the first
time to our knowledge, Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Worst-Case
Guarantees for the DC Optimal Power Flow problem. We look for guarantees
related to (i) maximum constraint violations, (ii) maximum distance between
predicted and optimal decision variables, and (iii) maximum sub-optimality in
the entire input domain. In a range of PGLib-OPF networks, we demonstrate how

proposed in this paper. Different feature fusion techniques are suggested to
facilitate the flow of information and improve the training of deep neural
networks. Some of these techniques as well as the proposed network can be
considered a type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Network, where a layer can
receive inputs from other layers and have outputs to other layers. In the
proposed general framework of Lattice Fusion Network (LFNet), feature maps of
each convolutional layer are passed to other layers based on a lattice graph
structure, where nodes are convolutional layers. To evaluate the performance of
the proposed architecture, different designs based on the general framework of
LFNet are implemented for the task of image denoising. This task is used as an
example where training deep convolutional networks is needed. Results are
compared with state of the art methods. The proposed network is able to achieve
better results with far fewer learnable parameters, which shows the

learning on graphs, but its training is notoriously difficult to scale both in
terms of graph size and the number of model parameters. Although some work has
explored training on large-scale graphs (e.g., GraphSAGE, ClusterGCN, etc.), we
pioneer efficient training of large-scale GCN models (i.e., ultra-wide,
overparameterized models) with the proposal of a novel, distributed training
framework. Our proposed training methodology, called GIST, disjointly
partitions the parameters of a GCN model into several, smaller sub-GCNs that
are trained independently and in parallel. In addition to being compatible with
any GCN architecture, GIST improves model performance, scales to training on
arbitrarily large graphs, significantly decreases wall-clock training time, and
enables the training of markedly overparameterized GCN models. Remarkably, with
GIST, we train an astonishgly-wide 32,768-dimensional GraphSAGE model, which
exceeds the capacity of a single GPU by a factor of 8X, to SOTA performance on

                                        <span>We present CSWin Transformer, an efficient and effective Transformer-based
backbone for general-purpose vision tasks. A challenging issue in Transformer
design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local
self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address
this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for
computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel
that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the
input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a detailed mathematical
analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for
different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling
capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce
Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional
information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports
arbitrary input resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for
downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure,
CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks.
Specifically, it achieves 85.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra
training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection
task, and 51.7 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing
previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and
+2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting. By further pretraining on
the larger dataset ImageNet-21K, we achieve 87.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K
and state-of-the-art segmentation performance on ADE20K with 55.2 mIoU. The

                                        <span>Clinical decision-making in oncology involves multimodal data such as
radiology scans, molecular profiling, histopathology slides, and clinical
factors. Despite the importance of these modalities individually, no deep
learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis.
Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse
multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to
combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities
(such as H&amp;E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a
comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality
are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the
information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal
orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by
incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS
in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly
outperforming (p&#x3D;0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median

                                        <span>A significant body of research in the data sciences considers unfair
discrimination against social categories such as race or gender that could
occur or be amplified as a result of algorithmic decisions. Simultaneously,
real-world disparities continue to exist, even before algorithmic decisions are
made. In this work, we draw on insights from the social sciences and humanistic
studies brought into the realm of causal modeling and constrained optimization,
and develop a novel algorithmic framework for tackling pre-existing real-world
disparities. The purpose of our framework, which we call the &quot;impact
remediation framework,&quot; is to measure real-world disparities and discover the
optimal intervention policies that could help improve equity or access to
opportunity for those who are underserved with respect to an outcome of
interest. We develop a disaggregated approach to tackling pre-existing
disparities that relaxes the typical set of assumptions required for the use of
social categories in structural causal models. Our approach flexibly
incorporates counterfactuals and is compatible with various ontological
assumptions about the nature of social categories. We demonstrate impact
remediation with a real-world case study and compare our disaggregated approach
to an existing state-of-the-art approach, comparing its structure and resulting
policy recommendations. In contrast to most work on optimal policy learning, we
explore disparity reduction itself as an objective, explicitly focusing the
power of algorithms on reducing inequality.</span>

                                        <span>Modern day engineering problems are ubiquitously characterized by
sophisticated computer codes that map parameters or inputs to an underlying
physical process. In other situations, experimental setups are used to model
the physical process in a laboratory, ensuring high precision while being
costly in materials and logistics. In both scenarios, only limited amount of
data can be generated by querying the expensive information source at a finite
number of inputs or designs. This problem is compounded further in the presence
of a high-dimensional input space. State-of-the-art parameter space dimension
reduction methods, such as active subspace, aim to identify a subspace of the
original input space that is sufficient to explain the output response. These
methods are restricted by their reliance on gradient evaluations or copious
data, making them inadequate to expensive problems without direct access to
gradients. The proposed methodology is gradient-free and fully Bayesian, as it
quantifies uncertainty in both the low-dimensional subspace and the surrogate
model parameters. This enables a full quantification of epistemic uncertainty
and robustness to limited data availability. It is validated on multiple
datasets from engineering and science and compared to two other
state-of-the-art methods based on four aspects: a) recovery of the active
subspace, b) deterministic prediction accuracy, c) probabilistic prediction
accuracy, and d) training time. The comparison shows that the proposed method
improves the active subspace recovery and predictive accuracy, in both the
deterministic and probabilistic sense, when only few model observations are
available for training, at the cost of increased training time.</span>

train dynamic and measurement models by learning from observed data. However,
most existing differentiable particle filters are within the bootstrap particle
filtering framework and fail to incorporate the information from latest
observations to construct better proposals. In this paper, we utilize
conditional normalizing flows to construct proposal distributions for
differentiable particle filters, enriching the distribution families that the
proposal distributions can represent. In addition, normalizing flows are
incorporated in the construction of the dynamic model, resulting in a more
expressive dynamic model. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
conditional normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters in a visual

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose approximate Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms to solve
convex optimization problems over graph-structured support sets where the
\textit{linear minimization oracle} (LMO) cannot be efficiently obtained in
general. We first demonstrate that two popular approximation assumptions
(\textit{additive} and \textit{multiplicative gap errors)}, are not valid for
our problem, in that no cheap gap-approximate LMO oracle exists in general.
Instead, a new \textit{approximate dual maximization oracle} (DMO) is proposed,
which approximates the inner product rather than the gap. When the objective is
$L$-smooth, we prove that the standard FW method using a $\delta$-approximate
DMO converges as $\mathcal{O}(L / \delta t + (1-\delta)(\delta^{-1} +
\delta^{-2}))$ in general, and as $\mathcal{O}(L/(\delta^2(t+2)))$ over a
$\delta$-relaxation of the constraint set. Additionally, when the objective is
$\mu$-strongly convex and the solution is unique, a variant of FW converges to
$\mathcal{O}(L^2\log(t)/(\mu \delta^6 t^2))$ with the same per-iteration
complexity. Our empirical results suggest that even these improved bounds are
pessimistic, with significant improvement in recovering real-world images with
graph-structured sparsity.</span>

                                        <span>Neural network training and validation rely on the availability of large
high-quality datasets. However, in many cases only incomplete datasets are
available, particularly in health care applications, where each patient
typically undergoes different clinical procedures or can drop out of a study.
Since the data to train the neural networks need to be complete, most studies
discard the incomplete datapoints, which reduces the size of the training data,
or impute the missing features, which can lead to artefacts. Alas, both
approaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we
introduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use
highly incomplete datasets. First, the dataset is split into subsets of samples
containing all values for a certain cluster of features. Then, these subsets
are used to train individual neural networks. Finally, this ensemble of neural
networks is combined into a single neural network whose training is fine-tuned
using all complete datapoints. Using two highly incomplete real-world medical
datasets, we show that GapNet improves the identification of patients with
underlying Alzheimer&#x27;s disease pathology and of patients at risk of
hospitalization due to Covid-19. By distilling the information available in
incomplete datasets without having to reduce their size or to impute missing
values, GapNet will permit to extract valuable information from a wide range of
datasets, benefiting diverse fields from medicine to engineering.</span>

can better be modeled as compositions of objects and their relations as opposed
to distributed representations. This inductive bias can be injected into neural
networks to potentially improve systematic generalization and learning
efficiency of downstream tasks in scenes with multiple objects. In this paper,
we train state-of-the-art unsupervised models on five common multi-object
datasets and evaluate segmentation accuracy and downstream object property
prediction. In addition, we study systematic generalization and robustness by
investigating the settings where either single objects are out-of-distribution
-- e.g., having unseen colors, textures, and shapes -- or global properties of
the scene are altered -- e.g., by occlusions, cropping, or increasing the
number of objects. From our experimental study, we find object-centric
representations to be generally useful for downstream tasks and robust to
shifts in the data distribution, especially if shifts affect single objects.</span>

non-repetitive time-varying parameters, which is also called non-repetitive
TVSs, is realized in this paper using iterative learning control (ILC). A
machine learning (ML) based nominal model update mechanism, which utilizes the
linear regression technique to update the nominal model at each ILC trial only
using the current trial information, is proposed for non-repetitive TVSs in
order to enhance the ILC performance. Given that the ML mechanism forces the
model uncertainties to remain within the ILC robust tolerance, an ILC update
law is proposed to deal with non-repetitive TVSs. How to tune parameters inside
ML and ILC algorithms to achieve the desired aggregate performance is also
provided. The robustness and reliability of the proposed method are verified by
simulations. Comparison with current state-of-the-art demonstrates its superior
control performance in terms of controlling precision. This paper broadens ILC
applications from time-invariant systems to non-repetitive TVSs, adopts ML
regression technique to estimate non-repetitive time-varying parameters between
two ILC trials and proposes a detailed parameter tuning mechanism to achieve
desired performance, which are the main contributions.</span>

                                        <span>Edge computing provides a promising paradigm to support the implementation of
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by offloading tasks to nearby edge nodes.
Meanwhile, the increasing network size makes it impractical for centralized
data processing due to limited bandwidth, and consequently a decentralized
learning scheme is preferable. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely
investigated and shown to be a promising solution for decision-making and
optimal control processes. For RL in a decentralized setup, edge nodes (agents)
connected through a communication network aim to work collaboratively to find a
policy to optimize the global reward as the sum of local rewards. However,
communication costs, scalability and adaptation in complex environments with
heterogeneous agents may significantly limit the performance of decentralized
RL. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has a structure that
allows for decentralized implementation, and has shown faster convergence than
gradient descent based methods. Therefore, we propose an adaptive stochastic
incremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm and apply the asI-ADMM to decentralized
RL with edge-computing-empowered IIoT networks. We provide convergence
properties for proposed algorithms by designing a Lyapunov function and prove
that the asI-ADMM has $O(\frac{1}{k}) +O(\frac{1}{M})$ convergence rate where
$k$ and $ M$ are the number of iterations and batch samples, respectively.
Then, we test our algorithm with two supervised learning problems. For
performance evaluation, we simulate two applications in decentralized RL
settings with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents. The experiment results show
that our proposed algorithms outperform the state of the art in terms of
communication costs and scalability, and can well adapt to complex IoT
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated a capacity for
perceptually impressive synthesis, but can they also be great likelihood-based
models? We answer this in the affirmative, and introduce a family of
diffusion-based generative models that obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on
standard image density estimation benchmarks. Unlike other diffusion-based
models, our method allows for efficient optimization of the noise schedule
jointly with the rest of the model. We show that the variational lower bound
(VLB) simplifies to a remarkably short expression in terms of the
signal-to-noise ratio of the diffused data, thereby improving our theoretical
understanding of this model class. Using this insight, we prove an equivalence
between several models proposed in the literature. In addition, we show that
the continuous-time VLB is invariant to the noise schedule, except for the
signal-to-noise ratio at its endpoints. This enables us to learn a noise
schedule that minimizes the variance of the resulting VLB estimator, leading to
faster optimization. Combining these advances with architectural improvements,
we obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on image density estimation benchmarks,
outperforming autoregressive models that have dominated these benchmarks for
many years, with often significantly faster optimization. In addition, we show
how to turn the model into a bits-back compression scheme, and demonstrate
lossless compression rates close to the theoretical optimum.</span>

classifiers with an exponentially-tailed loss (e.g., the exponential or

a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/t^2)$. This contrasts with a rate of

Nesterov acceleration to this dual, which manages to result in a simple and

                                        <span>Processing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly
task, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Therefore, Ai has
become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a
supportive tool for doctors. AI tools highly depend on data for training the
models. However, there are several constraints to access to large amounts of
medical data to train machine learning algorithms in the medical domain, e.g.,
due to privacy concerns and the costly, time-consuming medical data annotation
process. To address this, in this paper we present a novel synthetic data
generation pipeline called SinGAN-Seg to produce synthetic medical data with
the corresponding annotated ground truth masks. We show that these synthetic
data generation pipelines can be used as an alternative to bypass privacy
concerns and as an alternative way to produce artificial segmentation datasets
with corresponding ground truth masks to avoid the tedious medical data
annotation process. As a proof of concept, we used an open polyp segmentation
dataset. By training UNet++ using both the real polyp segmentation dataset and
the corresponding synthetic dataset generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we
show that the synthetic data can achieve a very close performance to the real
data when the real segmentation datasets are large enough. In addition, we show
that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improving the
performance of segmentation algorithms when the training dataset is very small.
Since our SinGAN-Seg pipeline is applicable for any medical dataset, this
pipeline can be used with any other segmentation datasets.</span>

analysis of the Stochastic ExtraGradient (SEG) method with constant step size,
and presenting variations of the method that yield favorable convergence. We
first note that the last iterate of the basic SEG method only contracts to a
fixed neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium, independent of the step size. This
contrasts sharply with the standard setting of minimization where standard
stochastic algorithms converge to a neighborhood that vanishes in proportion to
the square-root (constant) step size. Under the same setting, however, we prove
that when augmented with iteration averaging, SEG provably converges to the
Nash equilibrium, and such a rate is provably accelerated by incorporating a
scheduled restarting procedure. In the interpolation setting, we achieve an
optimal convergence rate up to tight constants. We present numerical
experiments that validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the SEG method when equipped with iteration averaging and
restarting.</span>

multi-agent reinforcement learning. Existing algorithms suffer from the problem
of uneven learning degree with the increase of the number of agents. In this
paper, a new structure for a multi-agent actor critic is proposed, and the
self-attention mechanism is applied in the critic network and the value
decomposition method used to solve the uneven problem. The proposed algorithm
makes full use of the samples in the replay memory buffer to learn the behavior
of a class of agents. First, a new update method is proposed for policy
networks that promotes learning efficiency. Second, the utilization of samples
is improved, at the same time reflecting the ability of perspective-taking
among groups. Finally, the &quot;deceptive signal&quot; in training is eliminated and the
learning degree among agents is more uniform than in the existing methods.
Multiple experiments were conducted in two typical scenarios of a multi-agent
particle environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can
perform better than the state-of-the-art ones, and that it exhibits higher
learning efficiency with an increasing number of agents.</span>

unify diverse architectures such as Euclidean convolutional neural networks,
graph neural networks, and group neural networks under the umbrella of
algebraic signal processing. An AlgNN is a stacked layered information
processing structure where each layer is conformed by an algebra, a vector
space and a homomorphism between the algebra and the space of endomorphisms of
the vector space. Signals are modeled as elements of the vector space and are
processed by convolutional filters that are defined as the images of the
elements of the algebra under the action of the homomorphism. We analyze
stability of algebraic filters and AlgNNs to deformations of the homomorphism
and derive conditions on filters that lead to Lipschitz stable operators. We
conclude that stable algebraic filters have frequency responses -- defined as
eigenvalue domain representations -- whose derivative is inversely proportional
to the frequency -- defined as eigenvalue magnitudes. It follows that for a
given level of discriminability, AlgNNs are more stable than algebraic filters,
thereby explaining their better empirical performance. This same phenomenon has
been proven for Euclidean convolutional neural networks and graph neural
networks. Our analysis shows that this is a deep algebraic property shared by a

                                        <span>Autonomous Driving (AD) related features provide new forms of mobility that
are also beneficial for other kind of intelligent and autonomous systems like
robots, smart transportation, and smart industries. For these applications, the
decisions need to be made fast and in real-time. Moreover, in the quest for
electric mobility, this task must follow low power policy, without affecting
much the autonomy of the mean of transport or the robot. These two challenges
can be tackled using the emerging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). When deployed
on a specialized neuromorphic hardware, SNNs can achieve high performance with
low latency and low power consumption. In this paper, we use an SNN connected
to an event-based camera for facing one of the key problems for AD, i.e., the
classification between cars and other objects. To consume less power than
traditional frame-based cameras, we use a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The
experiments are made following an offline supervised learning rule, followed by
mapping the learnt SNN model on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip. Our
best experiment achieves an accuracy on offline implementation of 86%, that
drops to 83% when it is ported onto the Loihi Chip. The Neuromorphic Hardware
implementation has maximum 0.72 ms of latency for every sample, and consumes
only 310 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
implementation of an event-based car classifier on a Neuromorphic Chip.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning models are often deployed in different settings than they
were trained and validated on, posing a challenge to practitioners who wish to
predict how well the deployed model will perform on a target distribution. If
an unlabeled sample from the target distribution is available, along with a
labeled sample from a possibly different source distribution, standard
approaches such as importance weighting can be applied to estimate performance
on the target. However, importance weighting struggles when the source and
target distributions have non-overlapping support or are high-dimensional.
Taking inspiration from fields such as epidemiology and polling, we develop
Mandoline, a new evaluation framework that mitigates these issues. Our key
insight is that practitioners may have prior knowledge about the ways in which
the distribution shifts, which we can use to better guide the importance
weighting procedure. Specifically, users write simple &quot;slicing functions&quot; -
noisy, potentially correlated binary functions intended to capture possible
axes of distribution shift - to compute reweighted performance estimates. We
further describe a density ratio estimation framework for the slices and show
how its estimation error scales with slice quality and dataset size. Empirical
validation on NLP and vision tasks shows that \name can estimate performance on
the target distribution up to $3\times$ more accurately compared to standard
baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Learning with neural networks relies on the complexity of the representable
functions, but more importantly, the particular assignment of typical
parameters to functions of different complexity. Taking the number of
activation regions as a complexity measure, recent works have shown that the
practical complexity of deep ReLU networks is often far from the theoretical
maximum. In this work we show that this phenomenon also occurs in networks with
maxout (multi-argument) activation functions and when considering the decision
boundaries in classification tasks. We also show that the parameter space has a
multitude of full-dimensional regions with widely different complexity, and
obtain nontrivial lower bounds on the expected complexity. Finally, we
investigate different parameter initialization procedures and show that they
can increase the speed of convergence in training.</span>

property of convolutional networks, showing that small shifts in the input can
affect the output predictions substantially. In this paper, we ask whether lack
of shift invariance is a problem in sound event classification, and whether
there are benefits in addressing it. Specifically, we evaluate two pooling
methods to improve shift invariance in CNNs, based on low-pass filtering and
adaptive sampling of incoming feature maps. These methods are implemented via
small architectural modifications inserted into the pooling layers of CNNs. We
evaluate the effect of these architectural changes on the FSD50K dataset using
models of different capacity and in presence of strong regularization. We show
that these modifications consistently improve sound event classification in all
cases considered, without adding any (or adding very few) trainable parameters,
which makes them an appealing alternative to conventional pooling layers. The
outcome is a new state-of-the-art mAP of 0.541 on the FSD50K classification
benchmark.</span>

                                        <span>Training the large deep neural networks that dominate NLP requires large
datasets. Many of these are collected automatically or via crowdsourcing, and
may exhibit systematic biases or annotation artifacts. By the latter, we mean
correlations between inputs and outputs that are spurious, insofar as they do
not represent a generally held causal relationship between features and
classes; models that exploit such correlations may appear to perform a given
task well, but fail on out of sample data. In this paper we propose methods to
facilitate identification of training data artifacts, using new hybrid
approaches that combine saliency maps (which highlight important input
features) with instance attribution methods (which retrieve training samples
influential to a given prediction). We show that this proposed training-feature
attribution approach can be used to uncover artifacts in training data, and use
it to identify previously unreported artifacts in a few standard NLP datasets.
We execute a small user study to evaluate whether these methods are useful to
NLP researchers in practice, with promising results. We make code for all
methods and experiments in this paper available.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance
with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning
interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of
self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which
makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required.
In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually
simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term
spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our
architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision transformers with
three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise
multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters,
and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity
trade-offs of our models on both ImageNet and downstream tasks. Our results
demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to
transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and
robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/GFNet</span>

                                        <span>Self-attention (SA), which encodes vector sequences according to their
pairwise similarity, is widely used in speech recognition due to its strong
context modeling ability. However, when applied to long sequence data, its
accuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average
operator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which
results in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this
issue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention
(RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of
self-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the
local window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different
test data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window
length is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further
generalize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the
performance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based
speech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin
speech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate
(CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the
SA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is
only slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to
tune the window length manually.</span>

problem domain and instance as input, resulting in a knowledge acquisition
bottleneck. Meanwhile, although deep learning has achieved significant success
in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which
is incompatible with symbolic systems such as planners. We propose Latplan, an
unsupervised architecture combining deep learning and classical planning. Given
only an unlabeled set of image pairs showing a subset of transitions allowed in
the environment (training inputs), Latplan learns a complete propositional PDDL
action model of the environment. Later, when a pair of images representing the
initial and the goal states (planning inputs) is given, Latplan finds a plan to
the goal state in a symbolic latent space and returns a visualized plan
execution. We evaluate Latplan using image-based versions of 6 planning
domains: 8-puzzle, 15-Puzzle, Blocksworld, Sokoban and Two variations of

that uses neural networks to estimate the probability distribution of voxel
occupancy. First, to take into account the PC sparsity, our method adaptively
partitions a point cloud into multiple voxel block sizes. This partitioning is
signalled via an octree. Second, we employ a deep auto-regressive generative
model to estimate the occupancy probability of each voxel given the previously
encoded ones. We then employ the estimated probabilities to code efficiently a
block using a context-based arithmetic coder. Our context has variable size and
can expand beyond the current block to learn more accurate probabilities. We
also consider using data augmentation techniques to increase the generalization
capability of the learned probability models, in particular in the presence of
noise and lower-density point clouds. Experimental evaluation, performed on a
variety of point clouds from four different datasets and with diverse
characteristics, demonstrates that our method reduces significantly (by up to
30%) the rate for lossless coding compared to the state-of-the-art MPEG codec.</span>

                                        <span>Efficient video action recognition remains a challenging problem. One large
model after another takes the place of the state-of-the-art on the Kinetics
dataset, but real-world efficiency evaluations are often lacking. In this work,
we fill this gap and investigate the use of transformers for efficient action
recognition. We propose a novel, lightweight action recognition architecture,
VideoLightFormer. In a factorized fashion, we carefully extend the 2D
convolutional Temporal Segment Network with transformers, while maintaining
spatial and temporal video structure throughout the entire model. Existing
methods often resort to one of the two extremes, where they either apply huge
transformers to video features, or minimal transformers on highly pooled video
features. Our method differs from them by keeping the transformer models small,
but leveraging full spatiotemporal feature structure. We evaluate
VideoLightFormer in a high-efficiency setting on the temporally-demanding
EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Something-Something-V2 (SSV2) datasets and find that it
achieves a better mix of efficiency and accuracy than existing state-of-the-art

is generally challenging. Existing approaches have utilized goal relabeling on
collected experiences to alleviate issues raised from sparse rewards. However,
these methods are still limited in efficiency and cannot make full use of
experiences. In this paper, we propose Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay
(MHER), which exploits experiences more efficiently by leveraging environmental
dynamics to generate virtual achieved goals. Replacing original goals with
virtual goals generated from interaction with a trained dynamics model leads to
a novel relabeling method, \emph{model-based relabeling} (MBR). Based on MBR,
MHER performs both reinforcement learning and supervised learning for efficient
policy improvement. Theoretically, we also prove the supervised part in MHER,
i.e., goal-conditioned supervised learning with MBR data, optimizes a lower
bound on the multi-goal RL objective. Experimental results in several
point-based tasks and simulated robotics environments show that MHER achieves
significantly higher sample efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

models and have been shown to improve the prediction performance, it has been
reported to be vulnerable to perturbations to the mechanism. To overcome the
vulnerability to perturbations in the mechanism, we are inspired by adversarial
training (AT), which is a powerful regularization technique for enhancing the
robustness of the models. In this paper, we propose a general training
technique for natural language processing tasks, including AT for attention
(Attention AT) and more interpretable AT for attention (Attention iAT). The
proposed techniques improved the prediction performance and the model
interpretability by exploiting the mechanisms with AT. In particular, Attention
iAT boosts those advantages by introducing adversarial perturbation, which
enhances the difference in the attention of the sentences. Evaluation
experiments with ten open datasets revealed that AT for attention mechanisms,
especially Attention iAT, demonstrated (1) the best performance in nine out of
ten tasks and (2) more interpretable attention (i.e., the resulting attention
correlated more strongly with gradient-based word importance) for all tasks.
Additionally, the proposed techniques are (3) much less dependent on
perturbation size in AT. Our code is available at

such as seeking clarifications about the question, taking advantage of clues,
abstaining in order to avoid incorrect answers, etc. This difference in task
formulation hinders the adoption of NLP systems in real-world settings. In this
work, we take a step towards bridging this gap and present a multi-stage task
that simulates a typical human-human questioner-responder interaction such as
an interview. Specifically, the system is provided with question
simplifications, knowledge statements, examples, etc. at various stages to
improve its prediction when it is not sufficiently confident. We instantiate

1.91% in Stage 2, 54.88% in Stage 3, and 72.02% in Stage 4 over the standard

                                        <span>Automatic speaker verification (ASV), one of the most important technology
for biometric identification, has been widely adopted in security-critic
applications, including transaction authentication and access control. However,
previous works have shown ASV is seriously vulnerable to recently emerged
adversarial attacks, yet effective countermeasures against them are limited. In
this paper, we adopt neural vocoders to spot adversarial samples for ASV. We
use neural vocoder to re-synthesize audio and find that the difference between
the ASV scores for the original and re-synthesized audio is a good indicator to
distinguish genuine and adversarial samples. As the very beginning work in this
direction of detecting adversarial samples for ASV, there is no reliable
baseline for comparison. So we first implement Griffin-Lim for detection and
set it as our baseline. The proposed method accomplishes effective detection
performance and outperforms all the baselines in all the settings. We also show
the neural vocoder adopted in the detection framework is dataset independent.
Our codes will be made open-source for future works to do comparison.</span>

                                        <span>Distributed learning has become a hot research topic, due to its wide
application in cluster-based large-scale learning, federated learning, edge
computing and so on. Most distributed learning methods assume no error and
attack on the workers. However, many unexpected cases, such as communication
error and even malicious attack, may happen in real applications. Hence,
Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed learning with attack or
error, has recently attracted much attention. Most existing BL methods are
synchronous, which will result in slow convergence when there exist
heterogeneous workers. Furthermore, in some applications like federated
learning and edge computing, synchronization cannot even be performed most of
the time due to the online workers (clients or edge servers). Hence,
asynchronous BL (ABL) is more general and practical than synchronous BL (SBL).
To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two ABL methods. One of them
cannot resist malicious attack. The other needs to store some training
instances on the server, which has the privacy leak problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, called buffered asynchronous stochastic gradient
descent (BASGD), for BL. BASGD is an asynchronous method. Furthermore, BASGD
has no need to store any training instances on the server, and hence can
preserve privacy in ABL. BASGD is theoretically proved to have the ability of
resisting against error and malicious attack. Moreover, BASGD has a similar
theoretical convergence rate to that of vanilla asynchronous SGD (ASGD), with
an extra constant variance. Empirical results show that BASGD can significantly
outperform vanilla ASGD and other ABL baselines, when there exists error or
attack on workers.</span>

applications and have proven to successfully classify objects in image data
with high accuracy. The current work uses archival data from the Faint Images
of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) to classify radio galaxies into
four classes: Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI), Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FRII),
Bent-Tailed (BENT), and Compact (COMPT). The model presented in this work is
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed architecture
comprises three parallel blocks of convolutional layers combined and processed
for final classification by two feed-forward layers. Our model classified
selected classes of radio galaxy sources on an independent testing subset with
an average of 96\% for precision, recall, and F1 score. The best selected
augmentation techniques were rotations, horizontal or vertical flips, and
increase of brightness. Shifts, zoom and decrease of brightness worsened the
performance of the model. The current results show that model developed in this

                                        <span>Incomplete instances with various missing attributes in many real-world
applications have brought challenges to the classification tasks. Missing
values imputation methods are often employed to replace the missing values with
substitute values. However, this process often separates the imputation and
classification, which may lead to inferior performance since label information
are often ignored during imputation. Moreover, traditional methods may rely on
improper assumptions to initialize the missing values, whereas the
unreliability of such initialization might lead to inferior performance. To
address these problems, a novel semi-supervised conditional normalizing flow
(SSCFlow) is proposed in this paper. SSCFlow explicitly utilizes the label
information to facilitate the imputation and classification simultaneously by
estimating the conditional distribution of incomplete instances with a novel
semi-supervised normalizing flow. Moreover, SSCFlow treats the initialized
missing values as corrupted initial imputation and iteratively reconstructs
their latent representations with an overcomplete denoising autoencoder to
approximate their true conditional distribution. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.</span>

relationships across multiple datasets. It generalizes canonical correlation
analysis that is designed for two datasets. We study sparse GCA when there are
potentially multiple generalized correlation tuples in data and the loading
matrix has a small number of nonzero rows. It includes sparse CCA and sparse
PCA of correlation matrices as special cases. We first formulate sparse GCA as
generalized eigenvalue problems at both population and sample levels via a
careful choice of normalization constraints. Based on a Lagrangian form of the
sample optimization problem, we propose a thresholded gradient descent
algorithm for estimating GCA loading vectors and matrices in high dimensions.
We derive tight estimation error bounds for estimators generated by the

a user knows and wants to know. This paper proposes a principled framework for
interactive visual exploration of relations in data, through views most
informative given the user&#x27;s current knowledge and objectives. The user can
input pre-existing knowledge of relations in the data and also formulate
specific exploration interests, which are then taken into account in the
exploration. The idea is to steer the exploration process towards the interests
of the user, instead of showing uninteresting or already known relations. The
user&#x27;s knowledge is modelled by a distribution over data sets parametrised by
subsets of rows and columns of data, called tile constraints. We provide a
computationally efficient implementation of this concept based on constrained
randomisation. Furthermore, we describe a novel dimensionality reduction method
for finding the views most informative to the user, which at the limit of no
background knowledge and with generic objectives reduces to PCA. We show that
the method is suitable for interactive use and is robust to noise, outperforms
standard projection pursuit visualisation methods, and gives understandable and
useful results in analysis of real-world data. We provide an open-source

                                        <span>There has been huge interest in studying human brain connectomes inferred
from different imaging modalities and exploring their relationship with human
traits, such as cognition. Brain connectomes are usually represented as
networks, with nodes corresponding to different regions of interest (ROIs) and
edges to connection strengths between ROIs. Due to the high-dimensionality and
non-Euclidean nature of networks, it is challenging to depict their population
distribution and relate them to human traits. Current approaches focus on
summarizing the network using either pre-specified topological features or
principal components analysis (PCA). In this paper, building on recent advances
in deep learning, we develop a nonlinear latent factor model to characterize
the population distribution of brain graphs and infer the relationships between
brain structural connectomes and human traits. We refer to our method as Graph
AuTo-Encoding (GATE). We applied GATE to two large-scale brain imaging
datasets, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) for adults, to understand the structural brain
connectome and its relationship with cognition. Numerical results demonstrate
huge advantages of GATE over competitors in terms of prediction accuracy,
statistical inference and computing efficiency. We found that structural
connectomes have a stronger association with a wide range of human cognitive
traits than was apparent using previous approaches.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the question of sequential prediction under the log-loss in terms
of cumulative regret. Namely, given a hypothesis class of distributions,
learner sequentially predicts the (distribution of the) next letter in sequence
and its performance is compared to the baseline of the best constant predictor
from the hypothesis class. The well-specified case corresponds to an additional
assumption that the data-generating distribution belongs to the hypothesis
class as well. Here we present results in the more general misspecified case.
Due to special properties of the log-loss, the same problem arises in the
context of competitive-optimality in density estimation, and model selection.
For the $d$-dimensional Gaussian location hypothesis class, we show that
cumulative regrets in the well-specified and misspecified cases asymptotically
coincide. In other words, we provide an $o(1)$ characterization of the
distribution-free (or PAC) regret in this case -- the first such result as far
as we know. We recall that the worst-case (or individual-sequence) regret in
this case is larger by an additive constant ${d\over 2} + o(1)$. Surprisingly,
neither the traditional Bayesian estimators, nor the Shtarkov&#x27;s normalized
maximum likelihood achieve the PAC regret and our estimator requires special
&quot;robustification&quot; against heavy-tailed data. In addition, we show two general
results for misspecified regret: the existence and uniqueness of the optimal
estimator, and the bound sandwiching the misspecified regret between
well-specified regrets with (asymptotically) close hypotheses classes.</span>

                                        <span>The incremental poses computed through odometry can be integrated over time
to calculate the pose of a device with respect to an initial location. The
resulting global pose may be used to formulate a second, consistency based,
loss term in a deep odometry setting. In such cases where multiple losses are
imposed on a network, the uncertainty over each output can be derived to weigh
the different loss terms in a maximum likelihood setting. However, when
imposing a constraint on the integrated transformation, due to how only
odometry is estimated at each iteration of the algorithm, there is no
information about the uncertainty associated with the global pose to weigh the
global loss term. In this paper, we associate uncertainties with the output
poses of a deep odometry network and propagate the uncertainties through each
iteration. Our goal is to use the estimated covariance matrix at each
incremental step to weigh the loss at the corresponding step while weighting
the global loss term using the compounded uncertainty. This formulation
provides an adaptive method to weigh the incremental and integrated loss terms
against each other, noting the increase in uncertainty as new estimates arrive.
We provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of pose estimates and show
that our method surpasses the accuracy of the state-of-the-art Visual Odometry
approaches. Then, uncertainty estimates are evaluated and comparisons against
fixed baselines are provided. Finally, the uncertainty values are used in a
realistic example to show the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification for
localization.</span>

                                        <span>Over the last few decades, various methods have been proposed for estimating
prediction intervals in regression settings, including Bayesian methods,
ensemble methods, direct interval estimation methods and conformal prediction
methods. An important issue is the calibration of these methods: the generated
prediction intervals should have a predefined coverage level, without being
overly conservative. In this work, we review the above four classes of methods
from a conceptual and experimental point of view. Results on benchmark data
sets from various domains highlight large fluctuations in performance from one
data set to another. These observations can be attributed to the violation of
certain assumptions that are inherent to some classes of methods. We illustrate
how conformal prediction can be used as a general calibration procedure for
methods that deliver poor results without a calibration step.</span>

propose a graph convolutional neural network that utilizes the discretized

network models, the proposed method has a number of advantages: (a) it is deep
in that it does not require featurization but can benefit from it, (b) it has a
simple implementation with standard convolutional filters and layers, (c) it
works natively on unstructured and structured grid data without interpolation
(unlike pixel-based convolutional neural networks), and (d) it preserves
rotational invariance like other graph-based convolutional neural networks. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed network and compare it to

be used for many digital library tasks, such as analyzing citation networks and
predicting research trends. Automatic metadata extraction is important to build
scalable digital library search engines. Most existing methods are designed for
born-digital documents, so they often fail to extract metadata from scanned
documents such as for ETDs. Traditional sequence tagging methods mainly rely on
text-based features. In this paper, we propose a conditional random field (CRF)
model that combines text-based and visual features. To verify the robustness of
our model, we extended an existing corpus and created a new ground truth corpus
consisting of 500 ETD cover pages with human validated metadata. Our
experiments show that CRF with visual features outperformed both a heuristic
and a CRF model with only text-based features. The proposed model achieved
81.3%-96% F1 measure on seven metadata fields. The data and source code are

                                        <span>Explaining the surprising generalization performance of deep neural networks
is an active and important line of research in theoretical machine learning.
Influential work by Arora et al. (ICML&#x27;18) showed that, noise stability
properties of deep nets occurring in practice can be used to provably compress
model representations. They then argued that the small representations of
compressed networks imply good generalization performance albeit only of the
compressed nets. Extending their compression framework to yield generalization
bounds for the original uncompressed networks remains elusive.

Our main contribution is the establishment of a compression-based framework
for proving generalization bounds. The framework is simple and powerful enough
to extend the generalization bounds by Arora et al. to also hold for the
original network. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we also show
that it allows us to give simple proofs of the strongest known generalization
bounds for other popular machine learning models, namely Support Vector
Machines and Boosting.</span>

                                        <span>We study computational hardness of feature and conjunction search through the
lens of circuit complexity. Let $x &#x3D; (x_1, ... , x_n)$ (resp., $y &#x3D; (y_1, ... ,
y_n)$) be Boolean variables each of which takes the value one if and only if a
neuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply
formulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\rm
FTR}_n(x) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i$ and ${\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i
\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).

We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed &#x3D; o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.</span>

machine learning applications such as processing of surveys and in different
medical applications. Recently, Gaussian copula models have been suggested as a
means of performing imputation of missing values using a probabilistic
framework. While the present Gaussian copula models have shown to yield state
of the art performance, they have two limitations: they are based on an
approximation that is fast but may be imprecise and they do not support
unordered multinomial variables. We address the first limitation using direct
and arbitrarily precise approximations both for model estimation and imputation
by using randomized quasi-Monte Carlo procedures. The method we provide has
lower errors for the estimated model parameters and the imputed values,
compared to previously proposed methods. We also extend the previous Gaussian
copula models to include unordered multinomial variables in addition to the
present support of ordinal, binary, and continuous variables.</span>

                                        <span>Disparate treatment occurs when a machine learning model yields different
decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional
space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent
expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by
solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds
for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a
group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this
effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</span>

establish baseline comparison metrics and to select an image classification
algorithm worthy of embedding into mission-critical satellite imaging systems.
The Overhead-MNIST dataset is a collection of satellite images similar in style

Extreme Gradient Boosting models produced the highest accuracies, Areas Under

                                        <span>Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on
various computer vision tasks. The ability of capturing short- and long-range
visual dependencies through self-attention is arguably the main source for the
success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead,
especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection). In
this paper, we present focal self-attention, a new mechanism that incorporates
both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions. Using this new
mechanism, each token attends the closest surrounding tokens at fine
granularity but the tokens far away at coarse granularity, and thus can capture
both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively.
With focal self-attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer
models, called Focal Transformer, which achieves superior performance over the
state-of-the-art vision Transformers on a range of public image classification
and object detection benchmarks. In particular, our Focal Transformer models
with a moderate size of 51.1M and a larger size of 89.8M achieve 83.5 and 83.8
Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224x224 resolution.
Using Focal Transformers as the backbones, we obtain consistent and substantial
improvements over the current state-of-the-art Swin Transformers for 6
different object detection methods trained with standard 1x and 3x schedules.
Our largest Focal Transformer yields 58.7/58.9 box mAPs and 50.9/51.3 mask mAPs
on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and 55.4 mIoU on ADE20K for semantic segmentation,
creating new SoTA on three of the most challenging computer vision tasks.</span>

label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few
explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch&#x27;s Postulates, the
foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we
propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical
diagnosis. By determining and isolating the neuron activation patterns on which
diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector relies to make decisions, we demonstrate the
direct relation between the isolated neuron activation and lesions for a
pathological explanation. To be specific, we first define novel pathological
descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial
and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded
in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically
plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even
arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated
lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly
related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both
qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods.
Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our
second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data
augmentation.</span>

recommender systems. In this paper, we study a novel problem of multi-facet
bandits involving a group of bandits, each characterizing the users&#x27; needs from
one unique aspect. In each round, for the given user, we need to select one arm
from each bandit, such that the combination of all arms maximizes the final
reward. This problem can find immediate applications in E-commerce, healthcare,
etc. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm, named MuFasa, which
utilizes an assembled neural network to jointly learn the underlying reward
functions of multiple bandits. It estimates an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
linked with the expected reward to balance between exploitation and
exploration. Under mild assumptions, we provide the regret analysis of MuFasa.
It can achieve the near-optimal $\widetilde{ \mathcal{O}}((K+1)\sqrt{T})$
regret bound where $K$ is the number of bandits and $T$ is the number of played
rounds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to show that MuFasa
outperforms strong baselines on real-world data sets.</span>

labeled examples. Many existing works take the meta-learning approach, sampling
few-shot tasks in turn and optimizing the few-shot learner&#x27;s performance on
classifying the query examples. In this paper, we point out two potential
weaknesses of this approach. First, the sampled query examples may not provide
sufficient supervision for the few-shot learner. Second, the effectiveness of
meta-learning diminishes sharply with increasing shots (i.e., the number of
training examples per class). To resolve these issues, we propose a novel
objective to directly train the few-shot learner to perform like a strong
classifier. Concretely, we associate each sampled few-shot task with a strong
classifier, which is learned with ample labeled examples. The strong classifier
has a better generalization ability and we use it to supervise the few-shot
learner. We present an efficient way to construct the strong classifier, making
our proposed objective an easily plug-and-play term to existing meta-learning
based FSL methods. We validate our approach in combinations with many
representative meta-learning methods. On several benchmark datasets including
miniImageNet and tiredImageNet, our approach leads to a notable improvement
across a variety of tasks. More importantly, with our approach, meta-learning
based FSL methods can consistently outperform non-meta-learning based ones,
even in a many-shot setting, greatly strengthening their applicability.</span>

&quot;prevalence&quot;) of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral,
Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts; this is especially important when
these texts are tweets, since most sentiment classification endeavours carried
out on Twitter data actually have quantification (and not the classification of
individual tweets) as their ultimate goal. It is well-known that solving
quantification via &quot;classify and count&quot; (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled
items via a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned
to a given class) is suboptimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate
quantification methods exist. In 2016, Gao and Sebastiani carried out a
systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment
quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimental protocol
followed in that work is flawed, and that its results are thus unreliable. We
now re-evaluate those quantification methods on the very same datasets, this
time following a now consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol,
that involves 5775 as many experiments as run in the original study. Our
experimentation yields results dramatically different from those obtained by
Gao and Sebastiani, and thus provide a different, much more solid understanding
of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.</span>

                                        <span>One of the key issues for imitation learning lies in making policy learned
from limited samples to generalize well in the whole state-action space. This
problem is much more severe in high-dimensional state environments, such as
game playing with raw pixel inputs. Under this situation, even state-of-the-art
adversary-based imitation learning algorithms fail. Through empirical studies,
we find that the main cause lies in the failure of training a powerful
discriminator to generate meaningful rewards in high-dimensional environments.
Although it seems that dimensionality reduction can help, a straightforward
application of off-the-shelf methods cannot achieve good performance. In this
work, we show in theory that the balance between dimensionality reduction and
discriminative training is essential for effective learning. To achieve this
target, we propose HashReward, which utilizes the idea of supervised hashing to
realize such an ideal balance. Experimental results show that HashReward could
outperform state-of-the-art methods for a large gap under the challenging
high-dimensional environments.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently emerged as a vehicle for applying
deep network architectures to graph and relational data. However, given the
increasing size of industrial datasets, in many practical situations the
message passing computations required for sharing information across GNN layers
are no longer scalable. Although various sampling methods have been introduced
to approximate full-graph training within a tractable budget, there remain
unresolved complications such as high variances and limited theoretical
guarantees. To address these issues, we build upon existing work and treat GNN
neighbor sampling as a multi-armed bandit problem but with a newly-designed
reward function that introduces some degree of bias designed to reduce variance
and avoid unstable, possibly-unbounded pay outs. And unlike prior bandit-GNN
use cases, the resulting policy leads to near-optimal regret while accounting
for the GNN training dynamics introduced by SGD. From a practical standpoint,
this translates into lower variance estimates and competitive or superior test
accuracy across several benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>The ability to transfer a policy from one environment to another is a
promising avenue for efficient robot learning in realistic settings where task
supervision is not available. This can allow us to take advantage of
environments well suited for training, such as simulators or laboratories, to
learn a policy for a real robot in a home or office. To succeed, such policy
transfer must overcome both the visual domain gap (e.g. different illumination
or background) and the dynamics domain gap (e.g. different robot calibration or
modelling error) between source and target environments. However, prior policy
transfer approaches either cannot handle a large domain gap or can only address
one type of domain gap at a time. In this paper, we propose a novel policy
transfer method with iterative &quot;environment grounding&quot;, IDAPT, that alternates
between (1) directly minimizing both visual and dynamics domain gaps by
grounding the source environment in the target environment domains, and (2)
training a policy on the grounded source environment. This iterative training
progressively aligns the domains between the two environments and adapts the
policy to the target environment. Once trained, the policy can be directly
executed on the target environment. The empirical results on locomotion and
robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach can effectively
transfer a policy across visual and dynamics domain gaps with minimal
supervision and interaction with the target environment. Videos and code are

                                        <span>An effective approach to exploration in reinforcement learning is to rely on
an agent&#x27;s uncertainty over the optimal policy, which can yield near-optimal
exploration strategies in tabular settings. However, in non-tabular settings
that involve function approximators, obtaining accurate uncertainty estimates
is almost as challenging a problem. In this paper, we highlight that value
estimates are easily biased and temporally inconsistent. In light of this, we
propose a novel method for estimating uncertainty over the value function that
relies on inducing a distribution over temporal difference errors. This
exploration signal controls for state-action transitions so as to isolate
uncertainty in value that is due to uncertainty over the agent&#x27;s parameters.
Because our measure of uncertainty conditions on state-action transitions, we
cannot act on this measure directly. Instead, we incorporate it as an intrinsic
reward and treat exploration as a separate learning problem, induced by the
agent&#x27;s temporal difference uncertainties. We introduce a distinct exploration
policy that learns to collect data with high estimated uncertainty, which gives
rise to a curriculum that smoothly changes throughout learning and vanishes in
the limit of perfect value estimates. We evaluate our method on hard
exploration tasks, including Deep Sea and Atari 2600 environments and find that
our proposed form of exploration facilitates both diverse and deep exploration.</span>

                                        <span>We study a decentralized channel allocation problem in an ad-hoc Internet of
Things network underlaying on the spectrum licensed to a primary cellular
network. In the considered network, the impoverished channel sensing/probing
capability and computational resource on the IoT devices make them difficult to
acquire the detailed Channel State Information (CSI) for the shared multiple
channels. In practice, the unknown patterns of the primary users&#x27; transmission
activities and the time-varying CSI (e.g., due to small-scale fading or device
mobility) also cause stochastic changes in the channel quality. Decentralized
IoT links are thus expected to learn channel conditions online based on partial
observations, while acquiring no information about the channels that they are
not operating on. They also have to reach an efficient, collision-free solution
of channel allocation with limited coordination. Our study maps this problem
into a contextual multi-player, multi-armed bandit game, and proposes a purely
decentralized, three-stage policy learning algorithm through trial-and-error.
Theoretical analyses shows that the proposed scheme guarantees the IoT links to
jointly converge to the social optimal channel allocation with a sub-linear
(i.e., polylogarithmic) regret with respect to the operational time.
Simulations demonstrate that it strikes a good balance between efficiency and
network scalability when compared with the other state-of-the-art decentralized
bandit algorithms.</span>

tasks to prepare for and learn faster in new, unseen, but related tasks. The
training tasks are usually hand-crafted to be representative of the expected
distribution of test tasks and hence all used in training. We show that given a
set of training tasks, learning can be both faster and more effective (leading
to better performance in the test tasks), if the training tasks are
appropriately selected. We propose a task selection algorithm,
Information-Theoretic Task Selection (ITTS), based on information theory, which
optimizes the set of tasks used for training in meta-RL, irrespectively of how
they are generated. The algorithm establishes which training tasks are both
sufficiently relevant for the test tasks, and different enough from one
another. We reproduce different meta-RL experiments from the literature and

                                        <span>While theoretically appealing, the application of the Wasserstein distance to
large-scale machine learning problems has been hampered by its prohibitive
computational cost. The sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants improve
the computational efficiency through the random projection, yet they suffer
from low accuracy if the number of projections is not sufficiently large,
because the majority of projections result in trivially small values. In this
work, we propose a new family of distance metrics, called augmented sliced
Wasserstein distances (ASWDs), constructed by first mapping samples to
higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks. It is
derived from a key observation that (random) linear projections of samples
residing on these hypersurfaces would translate to much more flexible nonlinear
projections in the original sample space, so they can capture complex
structures of the data distribution. We show that the hypersurfaces can be
optimized by gradient ascent efficiently. We provide the condition under which
the ASWD is a valid metric and show that this can be obtained by an injective
neural network architecture. Numerical results demonstrate that the ASWD
significantly outperforms other Wasserstein variants for both synthetic and
real-world problems.</span>

probability distributions from finite samples. Our main results establish the
convergence rates of GANs under a collection of integral probability metrics
defined through H\&quot;older classes, including the Wasserstein distance as a
special case. We also show that GANs are able to adaptively learn data
distributions with low-dimensional structures or have H\&quot;older densities, when
the network architectures are chosen properly. In particular, for distributions
concentrated around a low-dimensional set, we show that the learning rates of
GANs do not depend on the high ambient dimension, but on the lower intrinsic
dimension. Our analysis is based on a new oracle inequality decomposing the
estimation error into the generator and discriminator approximation error and
the statistical error, which may be of independent interest.</span>

                                        <span>Deep predictive models often make use of spurious correlations between the
label and the covariates that differ between training and test distributions.
In many classification tasks, spurious correlations are induced by a changing
relationship between the label and some nuisance variables correlated with the
covariates. For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the
background, which is the nuisance, can predict the type of animal, but this
nuisance label relationship does not always hold. This nuisance-label
relationship does not always hold. We formalize a family of distributions that
only differ in the nuisance-label relationship and and introduce a distribution
where this relationship is broken called the nuisance-randomized distribution.
We introduce a set of predictive models built from the nuisance-randomized
distribution with representations, that when conditioned on, do not correlate
the label and the nuisance. For models in this set, we lower bound the
performance for any member of the family with the mutual information between
the representation and the label under the nuisance-randomized distribution. To
build predictive models that maximize the performance lower bound, we develop
Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NURD). We evaluate NURD on a synthetic
example, colored-MNIST, and classifying chest X-rays. When using non-lung
patches as the nuisance in classifying chest X-rays, NURD produces models that
predict pneumonia under strong spurious correlations.</span>

current state-of-the-art methods that, given an input, detect whether an input

attack (e.g., PGD, Carlini-Wagner or clean). To achieve this, we extract
statistical profiles, which we term as anomaly feature vectors, from a set of
latent features. Preliminary findings suggest that AFVs can help distinguish
among several types of adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD versus Carlini-Wagner)
with close to 93% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results open the door
to using AFV-based methods for exploring not only adversarial attack detection

assumption that a collection of time series are generated in two steps: i) a
vector autoregressive process in a latent space, and ii) a nonlinear,
component-wise, monotonically increasing observation mapping. The latter
mappings are assumed invertible, and are modelled as shallow neural networks,
so that their inverse can be numerically evaluated, and their parameters can be
learned using a technique inspired in deep learning. Due to the function
inversion, the back-propagation step is not straightforward, and this paper
explains the steps needed to calculate the gradients applying implicit
differentiation. Whereas the model explainability is the same as that for
linear VAR processes, preliminary numerical tests show that the prediction
error becomes smaller.</span>

precision medicine; as such, we address the need for statistical methods that
provide actionable inference for a single unit at any point in time. We aim to
learn an optimal, unknown choice of the controlled components of the design in
order to optimize the expected outcome; with that, we adapt the randomization
mechanism for future time-point experiments based on the data collected on the
individual over time. Our results demonstrate that one can learn the optimal
rule based on a single sample, and thereby adjust the design at any point t
with valid inference for the mean target parameter. This work provides several
contributions to the field of statistical precision medicine. First, we define
a general class of averages of conditional causal parameters defined by the
current context for the single unit time-series data. We define a nonparametric
model for the probability distribution of the time-series under few
assumptions, and aim to fully utilize the sequential randomization in the
estimation procedure via the double robust structure of the efficient influence
curve of the proposed target parameter. We present multiple
exploration-exploitation strategies for assigning treatment, and methods for
estimating the optimal rule. Lastly, we present the study of the data-adaptive
inference on the mean under the optimal treatment rule, where the target
parameter adapts over time in response to the observed context of the
individual. Our target parameter is pathwise differentiable with an efficient
influence function that is doubly robust - which makes it easier to estimate
than previously proposed variations. We characterize the limit distribution of
our estimator under a Donsker condition expressed in terms of a notion of
bracketing entropy adapted to martingale settings.</span>

                                        <span>The limit order book (LOB) depicts the fine-grained demand and supply
relationship for financial assets and is widely used in market microstructure
studies. Nevertheless, the availability and high cost of LOB data restrict its
wider application. The LOB recreation model (LOBRM) was recently proposed to
bridge this gap by synthesizing the LOB from trades and quotes (TAQ) data.
However, in the original LOBRM study, there were two limitations: (1)
experiments were conducted on a relatively small dataset containing only one
day of LOB data; and (2) the training and testing were performed in a
non-chronological fashion, which essentially re-frames the task as
interpolation and potentially introduces lookahead bias. In this study, we
extend the research on LOBRM and further validate its use in real-world
application scenarios. We first advance the workflow of LOBRM by (1) adding a
time-weighted z-score standardization for the LOB and (2) substituting the
ordinary differential equation kernel with an exponential decay kernel to lower
computation complexity. Experiments are conducted on the extended LOBSTER
dataset in a chronological fashion, as it would be used in a real-world
application. We find that (1) LOBRM with decay kernel is superior to
traditional non-linear models, and module ensembling is effective; (2)
prediction accuracy is negatively related to the volatility of order volumes
resting in the LOB; (3) the proposed sparse encoding method for TAQ exhibits
good generalization ability and can facilitate manifold tasks; and (4) the
influence of stochastic drift on prediction accuracy can be alleviated by
increasing historical samples.</span>

                                        <span>Optimization in the latent space of variational autoencoders is a promising
approach to generate high-dimensional discrete objects that maximize an
expensive black-box property (e.g., drug-likeness in molecular generation,
function approximation with arithmetic expressions). However, existing methods
lack robustness as they may decide to explore areas of the latent space for
which no data was available during training and where the decoder can be
unreliable, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid objects. We
propose to leverage the epistemic uncertainty of the decoder to guide the
optimization process. This is not trivial though, as a naive estimation of
uncertainty in the high-dimensional and structured settings we consider would
result in high estimator variance. To solve this problem, we introduce an
importance sampling-based estimator that provides more robust estimates of
epistemic uncertainty. Our uncertainty-guided optimization approach does not
require modifications of the model architecture nor the training process. It
produces samples with a better trade-off between black-box objective and
validity of the generated samples, sometimes improving both simultaneously. We
illustrate these advantages across several experimental settings in digit
generation, arithmetic expression approximation and molecule generation for
drug design.</span>

                                        <span>In Byzantine robust distributed or federated learning, a central server wants
to train a machine learning model over data distributed across multiple
workers. However, a fraction of these workers may deviate from the prescribed
algorithm and send arbitrary messages. While this problem has received
significant attention recently, most current defenses assume that the workers
have identical data. For realistic cases when the data across workers are
heterogeneous (non-iid), we design new attacks which circumvent current
defenses, leading to significant loss of performance. We then propose a simple
resampling scheme that adapts existing robust algorithms to heterogeneous
datasets at a negligible computational cost. We also theoretically and
experimentally validate our approach, showing that combining resampling with
existing robust algorithms is effective against challenging attacks. Our work
is the first to establish guaranteed convergence for the non-iid Byzantine
robust problem under realistic assumptions.</span>

approached as a sequence tagging problem by classifying each recognized input
token into one of the IOB (Inside, Outside, and Beginning) categories. However,
such problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it cannot easily
handle complex spatial relationships and (2) it is not suitable for highly
structured information, which are nevertheless frequently observed in
real-world document images. To tackle these issues, we first formulate the IE
task as spatial dependency parsing problem that focuses on the relationship
among text tokens in the documents. Under this setup, we then propose SPADE
(SPAtial DEpendency parser) that models highly complex spatial relationships
and an arbitrary number of information layers in the documents in an end-to-end
manner. We evaluate it on various kinds of documents such as receipts, name
cards, forms, and invoices, and show that it achieves a similar or better
performance compared to strong baselines including BERT-based IOB taggger.</span>

that generate the observed data will often react to the decisions of the
learner. For example, a data source may have some incentive for the algorithm
to provide a particular label (e.g. approve a bank loan), and manipulate their
features accordingly. Work in strategic classification and decision-dependent
distributions seeks to characterize the closed-loop behavior of deploying
learning algorithms by explicitly considering the effect of the classifier on
the underlying data distribution. More recently, works in performative
prediction seek to classify the closed-loop behavior by considering general
properties of the mapping from classifier to data distribution, rather than an
explicit form. Building on this notion, we analyze repeated risk minimization
as the perturbed trajectories of the gradient flows of performative risk
minimization. We consider the case where there may be multiple local minimizers
of performative risk, motivated by real world situations where the initial
conditions may have significant impact on the long-term behavior of the system.
As a motivating example, we consider a company whose current employee
demographics affect the applicant pool they interview: the initial demographics
of the company can affect the long-term hiring policies of the company. We
provide sufficient conditions to characterize the region of attraction for the
various equilibria in this settings. Additionally, we introduce the notion of
performative alignment, which provides a geometric condition on the convergence
of repeated risk minimization to performative risk minimizers.</span>

learned by imitating policies for the corresponding fully observed Markov
decision processes. Unfortunately, existing approaches for this kind of
imitation learning have a serious flaw: the expert does not know what the
trainee cannot see, and so may encourage actions that are sub-optimal, even
unsafe, under partial information. We derive an objective to instead train the
expert to maximize the expected reward of the imitating agent policy, and use
it to construct an efficient algorithm, adaptive asymmetric DAgger (A2D), that
jointly trains the expert and the agent. We show that A2D produces an expert

recommend marketing content for multiple pages in sequence. Different from
general sequential decision making process, the use cases have a simpler flow
where customers per seeing recommended content on each page can only return
feedback as moving forward in the process or dropping from it until a
termination state. We refer to this type of problems as sequential decision
making in linear--flow. We propose to formulate the problem as an MDP with
Bandits where Bandits are employed to model the transition probability matrix.
At recommendation time, we use Thompson sampling (TS) to sample the transition
probabilities and allocate the best series of actions with analytical solution
through exact dynamic programming. The way that we formulate the problem allows
us to leverage TS&#x27;s efficiency in balancing exploration and exploitation and
Bandit&#x27;s convenience in modeling actions&#x27; incompatibility. In the simulation
study, we observe the proposed MDP with Bandits algorithm outperforms
Q-learning with $\epsilon$-greedy and decreasing $\epsilon$, independent

they must learn new motion skills and adapt them to unseen situations on the
fly. This demands learning models that capture relevant motion patterns, while
offering enough flexibility to adapt the encoded skills to new requirements,
such as dynamic obstacle avoidance. We introduce a Riemannian manifold
perspective on this problem, and propose to learn a Riemannian manifold from
human demonstrations on which geodesics are natural motion skills. We realize
this with a variational autoencoder (VAE) over the space of position and
orientations of the robot end-effector. Geodesic motion skills let a robot plan
movements from and to arbitrary points on the data manifold. They also provide
a straightforward method to avoid obstacles by redefining the ambient metric in
an online fashion. Moreover, geodesics naturally exploit the manifold resulting
from multiple--mode tasks to design motions that were not explicitly
demonstrated previously. We test our learning framework using a 7-DoF robotic
manipulator, where the robot satisfactorily learns and reproduces realistic
skills featuring elaborated motion patterns, avoids previously unseen
obstacles, and generates novel movements in multiple-mode settings.</span>

are the classical stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGDA) and the recently
introduced stochastic consensus optimization (SCO) (Mescheder et al., 2017).
SGDA is known to converge to a stationary point for specific classes of games,
but current convergence analyses require a bounded variance assumption. SCO is
used successfully for solving large-scale adversarial problems, but its
convergence guarantees are limited to its deterministic variant. In this work,
we introduce the expected co-coercivity condition, explain its benefits, and
provide the first last-iterate convergence guarantees of SGDA and SCO under
this condition for solving a class of stochastic variational inequality
problems that are potentially non-monotone. We prove linear convergence of both
methods to a neighborhood of the solution when they use constant step-size, and
we propose insightful stepsize-switching rules to guarantee convergence to the
exact solution. In addition, our convergence guarantees hold under the
arbitrary sampling paradigm, and as such, we give insights into the complexity
of minibatching.</span>

first an artificial dataset with a known bias is created and used to train
intentionally biased CNNs. The networks&#x27; decisions are then inspected using
attribution maps. Finally, meaningful metrics are used to measure the

                                        <span>In recent years, researchers have achieved great success in applying Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to Real-time Strategy (RTS) games,
creating strong autonomous agents that could defeat professional players in
StarCraft~II. However, existing approaches to tackle full games have high
computational costs, usually requiring the use of thousands of GPUs and CPUs
for weeks. This paper has two main contributions to address this issue: 1) We
introduce Gym-$\mu$RTS (pronounced &quot;gym-micro-RTS&quot;) as a fast-to-run RL
environment for full-game RTS research and 2) we present a collection of
techniques to scale DRL to play full-game $\mu$RTS as well as ablation studies
to demonstrate their empirical importance. Our best-trained bot can defeat
every $\mu$RTS bot we tested from the past $\mu$RTS competitions when working
in a single-map setting, resulting in a state-of-the-art DRL agent while only
taking about 60 hours of training using a single machine (one GPU, three vCPU,
16GB RAM).</span>

                                        <span>Real-world problems often involve the optimization of several objectives
under multiple constraints. An example is the hyper-parameter tuning problem of
machine learning algorithms. In particular, the minimization of the estimation
of the generalization error of a deep neural network and at the same time the
minimization of its prediction time. We may also consider as a constraint that
the deep neural network must be implemented in a chip with an area below some
size. Here, both the objectives and the constraint are black boxes, i.e.,
functions whose analytical expressions are unknown and are expensive to
evaluate. Bayesian optimization (BO) methodologies have given state-of-the-art
results for the optimization of black-boxes. Nevertheless, most BO methods are
sequential and evaluate the objectives and the constraints at just one input
location, iteratively. Sometimes, however, we may have resources to evaluate
several configurations in parallel. Notwithstanding, no parallel BO method has
been proposed to deal with the optimization of multiple objectives under
several constraints. If the expensive evaluations can be carried out in
parallel (as when a cluster of computers is available), sequential evaluations
result in a waste of resources. This article introduces PPESMOC, Parallel
Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with
Constraints, an information-based batch method for the simultaneous
optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the
presence of several constraints. Iteratively, PPESMOC selects a batch of input
locations at which to evaluate the black-boxes so as to maximally reduce the
entropy of the Pareto set of the optimization problem. We present empirical
evidence in the form of synthetic, benchmark and real-world experiments that
illustrate the effectiveness of PPESMOC.</span>

neuron has a theoretical guarantee in certified $\ell_\infty$ robustness.
However, due to the inherent difficulties in the training of the network, the
certified accuracy of previous work is limited. In this paper, we propose two
approaches to deal with these difficuties. Aiming at the characteristics of the
training process based on $\ell_\infty$-norm neural network, we introduce the
EMA method to improve the training process. Considering the randomness of the
training algorithm, we propose an ensemble method based on trained base models
that have the $1$-Lipschitz property and gain significant improvement in the
small parameter network. Moreover, we give the theoretical analysis of the
ensemble method based on the $1$-Lipschitz property on the certified
robustness, which ensures the effectiveness and stability of the algorithm. Our

                                        <span>In recent times, the trend in very large scale integration (VLSI) industry is
multi-dimensional, for example, reduction of energy consumption, occupancy of
less space, precise result, less power dissipation, faster response. To meet
these needs, the hardware architecture should be reliable and robust to these
problems. Recently, neural network and deep learning has been started to impact
the present research paradigm significantly which consists of parameters in the
order of millions, nonlinear function for activation, convolutional operation
for feature extraction, regression for classification, generative adversarial
networks. These operations involve huge calculation and memory overhead.
Presently available DSP processors are incapable of performing these operations
and they mostly face the problems, for example, memory overhead, performance
drop and compromised accuracy. Moreover, if a huge silicon area is powered to
accelerate the operation using parallel computation, the ICs will be having
significant chance of burning out due to the considerable generation of heat.
Hence, novel dark silicon constraint is developed to reduce the heat
dissipation without sacrificing the accuracy. Similarly, different algorithms
have been adapted to design a DSP processor compatible for fast performance in
neural network, activation function, convolutional neural network and
generative adversarial network. In this review, we illustrate the recent
developments in hardware for accelerating the efficient implementation of deep
learning networks with enhanced performance. The techniques investigated in
this review are expected to direct future research challenges of hardware
optimization for high-performance computations.</span>

problems, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of machine learning
and deep learning for the analysis of digital pathology and biopsy image
patches. However, traditional learning over patch-wise features using
convolutional neural networks limits the model when attempting to capture
global contextual information. The phenotypical and topological distribution of
constituent histological entities play a critical role in tissue diagnosis. As
such, graph data representations and deep learning have attracted significant
attention for encoding tissue representations, and capturing intra- and inter-
entity level interactions. In this review, we provide a conceptual grounding of
graph-based deep learning and discuss its current success for tumor
localization and classification, tumor invasion and staging, image retrieval,

                                        <span>Program synthesis from input-output examples has been a long-standing
challenge, and recent works have demonstrated some success in designing deep
neural networks for program synthesis. However, existing efforts in
input-output neural program synthesis have been focusing on domain-specific
languages, thus the applicability of previous approaches to synthesize code in
full-fledged popular programming languages, such as C, remains a question. The
main challenges lie in two folds. On the one hand, the program search space
grows exponentially when the syntax and semantics of the programming language
become more complex, which poses higher requirements on the synthesis
algorithm. On the other hand, increasing the complexity of the programming
language also imposes more difficulties on data collection, since building a
large-scale training set for input-output program synthesis require random
program generators to sample programs and input-output examples. In this work,
we take the first step to synthesize C programs from input-output examples. In
particular, we propose LaSynth, which learns the latent representation to
approximate the execution of partially generated programs, even if their
semantics are not well-defined. We demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing
elementary C code from input-output examples, and leveraging learned execution
significantly improves the prediction performance over existing approaches.
Meanwhile, compared to the randomly generated ground-truth programs, LaSynth
synthesizes more concise programs that resemble human-written code. We show
that training on these synthesized programs further improves the prediction
performance for both Karel and C program synthesis, indicating the promise of
leveraging the learned program synthesizer to improve the dataset quality for
input-output program synthesis.</span>

for prediction and certification that correctly accounts for multiple testing,
necessary for ensuring statistical guarantees. The key to our approach is
reliance on established multiple-testing correction mechanisms as well as the
ability to abstain from classifying single pixels or points while still
robustly segmenting the overall input. Our experimental evaluation on synthetic

prominent approaches for network pruning or sparsification. The method prunes
the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero.
However, recent work of Gale et al. reveals that although this method yields
high compression rates on smaller datasets, it performs inconsistently on
large-scale learning tasks, such as ResNet50 on ImageNet. We analyze this
phenomenon through the lens of variational inference and find that it is likely
due to the independent modeling of binary gates, the mean-field approximation,
which is known in Bayesian statistics for its poor performance due to the crude
approximation. To mitigate this deficiency, we propose a dependency modeling of
binary gates, which can be modeled effectively as a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). We term our algorithm Dep-$L_0$ as it prunes networks via a
dependency-enabled $L_0$ regularization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10,
CIFAR100 and ImageNet with VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet56 show that our Dep-$L_0$
outperforms the original $L_0$-HC algorithm of Louizos et al. by a significant
margin, especially on ImageNet. Compared with the state-of-the-arts network
sparsification algorithms, our dependency modeling makes the $L_0$-based
sparsification once again very competitive on large-scale learning tasks. Our

                                        <span>In quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, the very first step is to
embed the data in quantum space known as Hilbert space. Developing quantum
kernel function (QKF), which defines the distances among the samples in the
Hilbert space, belongs to the fundamental topics for machine learning. In this
work, we propose the rescaled logarithmic fidelity (RLF) and a non-parametric
active learning in the quantum space, which we name as RLF-NAL. The rescaling
takes advantage of the non-linearity of the kernel to tune the mutual distances
of samples in the Hilbert space, and meanwhile avoids the exponentially-small
fidelities between quantum many-qubit states. We compare RLF-NAL with several
well-known non-parametric algorithms including naive Bayes classifiers,
$k$-nearest neighbors, and spectral clustering. Our method exhibits excellent
accuracy particularly for the unsupervised case with no labeled samples and the
few-shot cases with small numbers of labeled samples. With the visualizations
by t-SNE, our results imply that the machine learning in the Hilbert space
complies with the principles of maximal coding rate reduction, where the
low-dimensional data exhibit within-class compressibility, between-class
discrimination, and overall diversity. Our proposals can be applied to other
quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, including the methods using the
parametric models such as tensor networks, quantum circuits, and quantum neural
networks.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian processes remain popular as a flexible and expressive model class,
but the computational cost of kernel hyperparameter optimization stands as a
major limiting factor to their scaling and broader adoption. Recent work has
made great strides combining stochastic estimation with iterative numerical
techniques, essentially boiling down GP inference to the cost of (many)
matrix-vector multiplies. Preconditioning -- a highly effective step for any
iterative method involving matrix-vector multiplication -- can be used to
accelerate convergence and thus reduce bias in hyperparameter optimization.
Here, we prove that preconditioning has an additional benefit that has been
previously unexplored. It not only reduces the bias of the $\log$-marginal
likelihood estimator and its derivatives, but it also simultaneously can reduce
variance at essentially negligible cost. We leverage this result to derive
sample-efficient algorithms for GP hyperparameter optimization requiring as few
as $\mathcal{O}(\log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ instead of
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples to achieve error $\varepsilon$. Our
theoretical results enable provably efficient and scalable optimization of
kernel hyperparameters, which we validate empirically on a set of large-scale
benchmark problems. There, variance reduction via preconditioning results in an
order of magnitude speedup in hyperparameter optimization of exact GPs.</span>

constrained semi-definite programming (SDP) problems at scale using accelerated
non-convex programming. Our algorithm non-trivially combines acceleration
motions from convex optimization with coordinate power iteration and matrix
factorization techniques. The algorithm is extremely simple to implement, and
adds only a single extra hyperparameter -- momentum. We prove that our method

merits of our method on three major application domains: MaxCut, MaxSAT, and
MIMO signal detection. In all cases, our methodology provides significant
speedups over non-convex and convex SDP solvers -- 5X faster than
state-of-the-art non-convex solvers, and 9 to 10^3 X faster than convex SDP

correlated features. The average feature ranking of the correlated group is
suppressed, which reduces interpretability and complicates feature selection.
In this paper we present ControlBurn, a feature selection algorithm that uses a
weighted LASSO-based feature selection method to prune unnecessary features
from tree ensembles, just as low-intensity fire reduces overgrown vegetation.
Like the linear LASSO, ControlBurn assigns all the feature importance of a
correlated group of features to a single feature. Moreover, the algorithm is
efficient and only requires a single training iteration to run, unlike
iterative wrapper-based feature selection methods. We show that ControlBurn
performs substantially better than feature selection methods with comparable
computational costs on datasets with correlated features.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from
a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally
attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between
the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher
model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to
mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits
the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper,
we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework
(IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and
exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer
the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model,
while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different
from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is
generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual
learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn
more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general
technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance.
Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the
performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning. The code and
models of IE-KD will be make publicly available at

a small summary, {\em e.g.,} coreset, that can efficiently represent the
original input. However, real-world datasets usually contain outliers and most
existing coreset construction methods are not resilient against outliers (in
particular, the outliers can be located arbitrarily in the space by an

for the {\em continuous-and-bounded learning} problem (with outliers) which
includes a broad range of popular optimization objectives in machine learning,
like logistic regression and $ k $-means clustering. Moreover, our robust
coreset can be efficiently maintained in fully-dynamic environment. To the best

high uncertainty caused by long-time delays. As one of the best alternatives to
human-level intelligence, Reinforcement Learning (RL) may offer a solution to
cope with these issues. This paper proposes to integrate RL with the Model
Mediated Teleoperation (MMT) concept. The teleoperator interacts with a
simulated virtual environment, which provides instant feedback. Whereas
feedback from the real environment is delayed, feedback from the model is
instantaneous, leading to high transparency. The MMT is realized in combination
with an intelligent system with two layers. The first layer utilizes Dynamic
Movement Primitives (DMP) which accounts for certain changes in the avatar
environment. And, the second layer addresses the problems caused by uncertainty
in the model using RL methods. Augmented reality was also provided to fuse the
avatar device and virtual environment models for the teleoperator. Implemented
on DLR&#x27;s Exodex Adam hand-arm haptic exoskeleton, the results show RL methods
are able to find different solutions when changes are applied to the object
position after the demonstration. The results also show DMPs to be effective at
adapting to new conditions where there is no uncertainty involved.</span>

                                        <span>Detection of colon polyps has become a trending topic in the intersecting
fields of machine learning and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The focus has mainly
been on per-frame classification. More recently, polyp segmentation has gained
attention in the medical community. Segmentation has the advantage of being
more accurate than per-frame classification or object detection as it can show
the affected area in greater detail. For our contribution to the EndoCV 2021
segmentation challenge, we propose two separate approaches. First, a
segmentation model named TriUNet composed of three separate UNet models.
Second, we combine TriUNet with an ensemble of well-known segmentation models,
namely UNet++, FPN, DeepLabv3, and DeepLabv3+, into a model called
DivergentNets to produce more generalizable medical image segmentation masks.
In addition, we propose a modified Dice loss that calculates loss only for a
single class when performing multiclass segmentation, forcing the model to
focus on what is most important. Overall, the proposed methods achieved the
best average scores for each respective round in the challenge, with TriUNet
being the winning model in Round I and DivergentNets being the winning model in
Round II of the segmentation generalization challenge at EndoCV 2021. The
implementation of our approach is made publicly available on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning endows an agent with a large variety
of skills, but it often struggles to solve tasks that require more temporally
extended reasoning. In this work, we propose to incorporate imagined subgoals
into policy learning to facilitate learning of complex tasks. Imagined subgoals
are predicted by a separate high-level policy, which is trained simultaneously
with the policy and its critic. This high-level policy predicts intermediate
states halfway to the goal using the value function as a reachability metric.
We don&#x27;t require the policy to reach these subgoals explicitly. Instead, we use
them to define a prior policy, and incorporate this prior into a KL-constrained
policy iteration scheme to speed up and regularize learning. Imagined subgoals
are used during policy learning, but not during test time, where we only apply
the learned policy. We evaluate our approach on complex robotic navigation and
manipulation tasks and show that it outperforms existing methods by a large
margin.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training tends to result in models that are less accurate on
natural (unperturbed) examples compared to standard models. This can be
attributed to either an algorithmic shortcoming or a fundamental property of
the training data distribution, which admits different solutions for optimal
standard and adversarial classifiers. In this work, we focus on the latter case
under a binary Gaussian mixture classification problem. Unlike earlier work, we
aim to derive the natural accuracy gap between the optimal Bayes and
adversarial classifiers, and study the effect of different distributional
parameters, namely separation between class centroids, class proportions, and
the covariance matrix, on the derived gap. We show that under certain
conditions, the natural error of the optimal adversarial classifier, as well as
the gap, are locally minimized when classes are balanced, contradicting the
performance of the Bayes classifier where perfect balance induces the worst
accuracy. Moreover, we show that with an $\ell_\infty$ bounded perturbation and
an adversarial budget of $\epsilon$, this gap is $\Theta(\epsilon^2)$ for the
worst-case parameters, which for suitably small $\epsilon$ indicates the
theoretical possibility of achieving robust classifiers with near-perfect
accuracy, which is rarely reflected in practical algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Benefiting from the powerful expressive capability of graphs, graph-based
approaches have achieved impressive performance in various biomedical
applications. Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among
samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings
for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not
easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the
complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these
factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about
the patient&#x27;s condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction.
To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated
with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate
the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity
between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix
manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured
through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized
with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among
samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable
to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group
of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed
and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In
addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide
more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and
inspiration for disease research.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer-based models are popularly used in natural language processing
(NLP). Its core component, self-attention, has aroused widespread interest. To
understand the self-attention mechanism, a direct method is to visualize the
attention map of a pre-trained model. Based on the patterns observed, a series
of efficient Transformers with different sparse attention masks have been
proposed. From a theoretical perspective, universal approximability of
Transformer-based models is also recently proved. However, the above
understanding and analysis of self-attention is based on a pre-trained model.
To rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance
of different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising
result is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important
compared with other attention positions. We provide a proof showing that these
diagonal elements can indeed be removed without deteriorating model
performance. Furthermore, we propose a Differentiable Attention Mask (DAM)
algorithm, which further guides the design of the SparseBERT. Extensive
experiments verify our interesting findings and illustrate the effect of the
proposed algorithm.</span>

handle complex tasks such as image classification, object recognition, natural
language processing etc. Consequently DNN structural vulnerabilities become
part of the security vulnerabilities in those systems. In this paper we study
the root cause of DNN adversarial examples. We examine the DNN response surface
to understand its classification boundary. Our study reveals the structural
problem of DNN classification boundary that leads to the adversarial examples.
Existing attack algorithms can generate from a handful to a few hundred
adversarial examples given one clean image. We show there are infinitely many
adversarial images given one clean sample, all within a small neighborhood of
the clean sample. We then define DNN uncertainty regions and show
transferability of adversarial examples is not universal. We also argue that
generalization error, the large sample theoretical guarantee established for
DNN, cannot adequately capture the phenomenon of adversarial examples. We need
new theory to measure DNN robustness.</span>

                                        <span>Forecasting windmill time series is often the basis of other processes such
as anomaly detection, health monitoring, or maintenance scheduling. The amount
of data generated on windmill farms makes online learning the most viable
strategy to follow. Such settings require retraining the model each time a new
batch of data is available. However, update the model with the new information
is often very expensive to perform using traditional Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). In this paper, we use Long Short-term Cognitive Networks (LSTCNs) to
forecast windmill time series in online settings. These recently introduced
neural systems consist of chained Short-term Cognitive Network blocks, each
processing a temporal data chunk. The learning algorithm of these blocks is
based on a very fast, deterministic learning rule that makes LSTCNs suitable
for online learning tasks. The numerical simulations using a case study with
four windmills showed that our approach reported the lowest forecasting errors
with respect to a simple RNN, a Long Short-term Memory, a Gated Recurrent Unit,
and a Hidden Markov Model. What is perhaps more important is that the LSTCN
approach is significantly faster than these state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning has been a hot research topic in enabling the
collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations
under the privacy restrictions. As researchers try to support more machine
learning models with different privacy-preserving approaches, there is a
requirement in developing systems and infrastructures to ease the development
of various federated learning algorithms. Similar to deep learning systems such
as PyTorch and TensorFlow that boost the development of deep learning,
federated learning systems (FLSs) are equivalently important, and face
challenges from various aspects such as effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy.
In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on federated learning
systems. To achieve smooth flow and guide future research, we introduce the
definition of federated learning systems and analyze the system components.
Moreover, we provide a thorough categorization for federated learning systems
according to six different aspects, including data distribution, machine
learning model, privacy mechanism, communication architecture, scale of
federation and motivation of federation. The categorization can help the design
of federated learning systems as shown in our case studies. By systematically
summarizing the existing federated learning systems, we present the design
factors, case studies, and future research opportunities.</span>

While it is implemented with a simple and efficient algorithm, it can estimate
the number of clusters simultaneously. However, DP-means is specifically
designed for the average distortion measure. Therefore, it is vulnerable to
outliers in data, and can cause large maximum distortion in clusters. In this
work, we extend the objective function of the DP-means to $f$-separable
distortion measures and propose a unified learning algorithm to overcome the
above problems by selecting the function $f$. Further, the influence function
of the estimated cluster center is analyzed to evaluate the robustness against
outliers. We demonstrate the performance of the generalized method by numerical

                                        <span>Recent advance in deep offline reinforcement learning (RL) has made it
possible to train strong robotic agents from offline datasets. However,
depending on the quality of the trained agents and the application being
considered, it is often desirable to fine-tune such agents via further online
interactions. In this paper, we observe that state-action distribution shift
may lead to severe bootstrap error during fine-tuning, which destroys the good
initial policy obtained via offline RL. To address this issue, we first propose
a balanced replay scheme that prioritizes samples encountered online while also
encouraging the use of near-on-policy samples from the offline dataset.
Furthermore, we leverage multiple Q-functions trained pessimistically offline,
thereby preventing overoptimism concerning unfamiliar actions at novel states
during the initial training phase. We show that the proposed method improves
sample-efficiency and final performance of the fine-tuned robotic agents on
various locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our code is available at:

learning tiered latent representations and latent spaces for molecular graphs
that explicitly represent and utilize groups (e.g., functional groups). This
enables the utilization and exploration of tiered molecular latent spaces,
either individually - the node (atom) tier, the group tier, or the graph
(molecule) tier - or jointly, as well as navigation across the tiers. In this
paper, we discuss the use of tiered graph autoencoders together with graph
prediction for molecular graphs. We show features of molecular graphs used, and
groups in molecular graphs identified for some sample molecules. We briefly
review graph prediction and the QM9 dataset for background information, and
discuss the use of tiered graph embeddings for graph prediction, particularly
weighted group pooling. We find that functional groups and ring groups
effectively capture and represent the chemical essence of molecular graphs
(structures). Further, tiered graph autoencoders and graph prediction together
provide effective, efficient and interpretable deep learning for molecular
graphs, with the former providing unsupervised, transferable learning and the
latter providing supervised, task-optimized learning.</span>

learning. In this paper, we propose a decaying momentum (\textsc{Demon}) rule.
We conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of momentum decay methods
for modern neural network optimization, in addition to the most popular
learning rate decay schedules. Across 28 relevant combinations of models,
epochs, datasets, and optimizers, \textsc{Demon} achieves the highest number of
Top-1 and Top-3 finishes at 39\% and 85\% respectively, almost doubling the
second-placed learning rate cosine schedule at 17\% and 60\%, respectively.
\textsc{Demon} also outperforms other widely used schedulers including, but not
limited to, the learning rate step schedule, linear schedule, OneCycle
schedule, and exponential schedule. Compared with the widely used learning rate
step schedule, \textsc{Demon} is observed to be less sensitive to parameter
tuning, which is critical to training neural networks in practice. Results are
demonstrated across a variety of settings and architectures, including image
classification, generative models, and language models. \textsc{Demon} is easy
to implement, requires no additional tuning, and incurs almost no extra
computational overhead compared to the vanilla counterparts. Code is readily
available.</span>

challenging tasks directly from visual observations, generalizing learned
skills to novel environments remains very challenging. Extensive use of data
augmentation is a promising technique for improving generalization in RL, but
it is often found to decrease sample efficiency and can even lead to
divergence. In this paper, we investigate causes of instability when using data
augmentation in common off-policy RL algorithms. We identify two problems, both
rooted in high-variance Q-targets. Based on our findings, we propose a simple
yet effective technique for stabilizing this class of algorithms under
augmentation. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of image-based RL using
both ConvNets and Vision Transformers (ViT) on a family of benchmarks based on
DeepMind Control Suite, as well as in robotic manipulation tasks. Our method
greatly improves stability and sample efficiency of ConvNets under
augmentation, and achieves generalization results competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for image-based RL. We further show that our method
scales to RL with ViT-based architectures, and that data augmentation may be
especially important in this setting.</span>

relation to feature engineering. However, comparable efforts are instead
required to determine effective architectures. In addition, as the sizes of
networks have grown overly large, a considerable amount of resources is also
invested in reducing the sizes. The sparsification of an over-complete model
addresses these problems as it removes redundant components and connections. In
this study, we propose a fully differentiable sparsification method for deep
neural networks which allows parameters to be zero during training via
stochastic gradient descent. Thus, the proposed method can learn the sparsified
structure and weights of a network in an end-to-end manner. The method is
directly applicable to various modern deep neural networks and imposes minimum
modification to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first fully [sub-]differentiable sparsification method that zeroes out
parameters. It provides a foundation for future structure learning and model
compression methods.</span>

computer vision, natural language processing and audio/speech signal
processing, a wide range of features where engineered through decades of
research efforts. As it turns out, learning to predict such features has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task leading to building useful
self-supervised representations that prove to be effective for downstream
tasks. However, methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks,
where each task targets a different group of features for better performance on
the downstream task have not been explored and understood properly. In fact,
the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally heavy experimental
procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of the number of pretext
tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group of pretext tasks among
a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates properly calibrated
weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered pretext tasks
during the self-supervised training process. The experiments conducted on
speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition validate our approach, as
the groups selected and weighted with our method perform better than classic
baselines, thus facilitating the selection and combination of relevant
pseudo-labels for self-supervised representation learning.</span>

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), despite being energy-efficient when
implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial
attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a
misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet
efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event
sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters
for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two
types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the
filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks.
Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware
Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset
and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean
frames. The source code of all the proposed DVS-Attacks and noise filters is
released at https://github.com/albertomarchisio/DVS-Attacks.</span>

rapidly expanding. Still, a theoretical understanding of how neural networks
learn chaos is lacking. Here, we employ a geometric perspective to show that
neural networks can efficiently model chaotic dynamics by becoming structurally
chaotic themselves. We first confirm neural network&#x27;s efficiency in emulating
chaos by showing that a parsimonious neural network trained only on few data
points can reconstruct strange attractors, extrapolate outside training data
boundaries, and accurately predict local divergence rates. We then posit that
the trained network&#x27;s map comprises sequential geometric stretching, rotation,
and compression operations. These geometric operations indicate topological
mixing and chaos, explaining why neural networks are naturally suitable to
emulate chaotic dynamics.</span>

nonstationary way, most of deep learning methods optimize neural networks on
training data, and this leads to severe performance degradation when dataset
shift happens. However, it is less possible to annotate or inspect newly
streamed data by humans, and thus it is desired to measure model drift at
inference time in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a novel
method of model drift estimation by exploiting statistics of batch
normalization layer on unlabeled test data. To remedy possible sampling error
of streamed input data, we adopt low-rank approximation to each
representational layer. We show the effectiveness of our method not only on
dataset shift detection but also on model selection when there are multiple
candidate models among model zoo or training trajectories in an unsupervised
way. We further demonstrate the consistency of our method by comparing model
drift scores between different network architectures.</span>

final alignment than the actual background dataset on which the strategy is

visual information corresponding to the singers&#x27; vocal activities to further
improve the quality of the separated vocal signals. The video frontend model
takes the input of mouth movement and fuses it into the feature embeddings of
an audio-based separation framework. To facilitate the network to learn
audiovisual correlation of singing activities, we add extra vocal signals
irrelevant to the mouth movement to the audio mixture during training. We
create two audiovisual singing performance datasets for training and
evaluation, respectively, one curated from audition recordings on the Internet,
and the other recorded in house. The proposed method outperforms audio-based
methods in terms of separation quality on most test recordings. This advantage
is especially pronounced when there are backing vocals in the accompaniment,
which poses a great challenge for audio-only methods.</span>

                                        <span>We explore methodologies to improve the robustness of generative adversarial
imitation learning (GAIL) algorithms to observation noise. Towards this
objective, we study the effect of local Lipschitzness of the discriminator and
the generator on the robustness of policies learned by GAIL. In many robotics
applications, the learned policies by GAIL typically suffer from a degraded
performance at test time since the observations from the environment might be
corrupted by noise. Hence, robustifying the learned policies against the
observation noise is of critical importance. To this end, we propose a
regularization method to induce local Lipschitzness in the generator and the
discriminator of adversarial imitation learning methods. We show that the
modified objective leads to learning significantly more robust policies.
Moreover, we demonstrate -- both theoretically and experimentally -- that
training a locally Lipschitz discriminator leads to a locally Lipschitz
generator, thereby improving the robustness of the resultant policy. We perform
extensive experiments on simulated robot locomotion environments from the
MuJoCo suite that demonstrate the proposed method learns policies that
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art generative adversarial imitation
learning algorithm when applied to test scenarios with noise-corrupted
observations.</span>

communication constraints for Gaussian sequence model and white noise model are
studied. The minimax rate of convergence for distributed estimation over a
given Besov class, which serves as a benchmark for the cost of adaptation, is
established. We then quantify the exact communication cost for adaptation and
construct an optimally adaptive procedure for distributed estimation over a
range of Besov classes. The results demonstrate significant differences between
nonparametric function estimation in the distributed setting and the
conventional centralized setting. For global estimation, adaptation in general
cannot be achieved for free in the distributed setting. The new technical tools

experiment setup and criteria for identifying the &quot;winning ticket&quot; in
literature. To reconcile such, we revisit the definition of lottery ticket
hypothesis, with comprehensive and more rigorous conditions. Under our new
definition, we show concrete evidence to clarify whether the winning ticket
exists across the major DNN architectures and/or applications. Through
extensive experiments, we perform quantitative analysis on the correlations
between winning tickets and various experimental factors, and empirically study
the patterns of our observations. We find that the key training
hyperparameters, such as learning rate and training epochs, as well as the
architecture characteristics such as capacities and residual connections, are
all highly correlated with whether and when the winning tickets can be
identified. Based on our analysis, we summarize a guideline for parameter
settings in regards of specific architecture characteristics, which we hope to
catalyze the research progress on the topic of lottery ticket hypothesis.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) allows edge devices to collectively learn a model
without directly sharing data within each device, thus preserving privacy and
eliminating the need to store data globally. While there are promising results
under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (iid) local
data, current state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from performance degradation
as the heterogeneity of local data across clients increases. To resolve this
issue, we propose a simple framework, Mean Augmented Federated Learning (MAFL),
where clients send and receive averaged local data, subject to the privacy
requirements of target applications. Under our framework, we propose a new
augmentation algorithm, named FedMix, which is inspired by a phenomenal yet
simple data augmentation method, Mixup, but does not require local raw data to
be directly shared among devices. Our method shows greatly improved performance
in the standard benchmark datasets of FL, under highly non-iid federated
settings, compared to conventional algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation has caught a lot of attention in Federated Learning
(FL) recently. It has the advantage for FL to train on heterogeneous clients
which have different data size and data structure. However, data samples across
all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed
(non-i.i.d), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of
federated learning. As FL randomly asks the clients to join the training
process and each client only learns from local non-i.i.d data, which makes
learning processing even slower. In order to solve this problem, an intuitive
idea is using the global model to guide local training. In this paper, we
propose a novel global knowledge distillation method, named FedGKD, which
learns the knowledge from past global models to tackle down the local bias
training problem. By learning from global knowledge and consistent with current
local models, FedGKD learns a global knowledge model in FL. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on
various CV datasets (CIFAR-10/100) and settings (non-i.i.d data). The
evaluation results show that FedGKD outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods.</span>

                                        <span>In real-world applications, data often come in a growing manner, where the
data volume and the number of classes may increase dynamically. This will bring
a critical challenge for learning: given the increasing data volume or the
number of classes, one has to instantaneously adjust the neural model capacity
to obtain promising performance. Existing methods either ignore the growing
nature of data or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a
given dataset, and thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures
for the changed data. To address this, we present a neural architecture
adaptation method, namely Adaptation eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust
previous architectures on the growing data. Specifically, we introduce an
architecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture for each data
snapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent between
current and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation
condition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding
unnecessary and time-consuming adjustments. Extensive experiments on two growth
scenarios (increasing data volume and number of classes) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Autoencoders are composed of coding and decoding units, hence they hold the
inherent potential of high-performance data compression and signal compressed
sensing. The main disadvantages of current autoencoders comprise the following
several aspects: the research objective is not data reconstruction but feature
representation; the performance evaluation of data recovery is neglected; it is
hard to achieve lossless data reconstruction by pure autoencoders, even by pure
deep learning. This paper aims for image reconstruction of autoencoders,
employs cascade decoders-based autoencoders, perfects the performance of image
reconstruction, approaches gradually lossless image recovery, and provides
solid theory and application basis for autoencoders-based image compression and
compressed sensing. The proposed serial decoders-based autoencoders include the
architectures of multi-level decoders and the related optimization algorithms.
The cascade decoders consist of general decoders, residual decoders,
adversarial decoders and their combinations. It is evaluated by the
experimental results that the proposed autoencoders outperform the classical
autoencoders in the performance of image reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>A generic video summary is an abridged version of a video that conveys the
whole story and features the most important scenes. Yet the importance of
scenes in a video is often subjective, and users should have the option of
customizing the summary by using natural language to specify what is important
to them. Further, existing models for fully automatic generic summarization
have not exploited available language models, which can serve as an effective
prior for saliency. This work introduces CLIP-It, a single framework for
addressing both generic and query-focused video summarization, typically
approached separately in the literature. We propose a language-guided
multimodal transformer that learns to score frames in a video based on their
importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined
query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense
video caption (for generic video summarization). Our model can be extended to
the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. We
outperform baselines and prior work by a significant margin on both standard
video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and a query-focused video
summarization dataset (QFVS). Particularly, we achieve large improvements in
the transfer setting, attesting to our method&#x27;s strong generalization
capabilities.</span>

learning, exciting progress has been made recently. Despite achieving better
compression performance, existing end-to-end compression algorithms are still
designed towards better signal quality in terms of rate-distortion
optimization. In this paper, we show that the design and optimization of
network architecture could be further improved for compression towards machine
vision. We propose an inverted bottleneck structure for end-to-end compression
towards machine vision, which specifically accounts for efficient
representation of the semantic information. Moreover, we quest the capability
of optimization by incorporating the analytics accuracy into the optimization
process, and the optimality is further explored with generalized rate-accuracy
optimization in an iterative manner. We use object detection as a showcase for
end-to-end compression towards machine vision, and extensive experiments show
that the proposed scheme achieves significant BD-rate savings in terms of
analysis performance. Moreover, the promise of the scheme is also demonstrated
with strong generalization capability towards other machine vision tasks, due
to the enabling of signal-level reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>Clinical decision-making in oncology involves multimodal data such as
radiology scans, molecular profiling, histopathology slides, and clinical
factors. Despite the importance of these modalities individually, no deep
learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis.
Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse
multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to
combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities
(such as H&amp;E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a
comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality
are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the
information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal
orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by
incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS
in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly
outperforming (p&#x3D;0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median
C-index of 0.718 +/- 0.064. The prognostic model significantly stratifies
glioma patients by OS within clinical subsets, adding further granularity to
prognostic clinical grading and molecular subtyping.</span>

                                        <span>Recent pretraining models in Chinese neglect two important aspects specific
to the Chinese language: glyph and pinyin, which carry significant syntax and
semantic information for language understanding. In this work, we propose
ChineseBERT, which incorporates both the {\it glyph} and {\it pinyin}
information of Chinese characters into language model pretraining. The glyph
embedding is obtained based on different fonts of a Chinese character, being
able to capture character semantics from the visual features, and the pinyin
embedding characterizes the pronunciation of Chinese characters, which handles
the highly prevalent heteronym phenomenon in Chinese (the same character has
different pronunciations with different meanings). Pretrained on large-scale
unlabeled Chinese corpus, the proposed ChineseBERT model yields significant
performance boost over baseline models with fewer training steps. The porpsoed
model achieves new SOTA performances on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks,
including machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, text
classification, sentence pair matching, and competitive performances in named
entity recognition. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at
https://github.com/ShannonAI/ChineseBert.</span>

Precedent Prediction (LPP), the task of predicting relevant passages from
precedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. To this
end, the paper showcases a BERT model, trained on 530,000 examples of legal
arguments made by U.S. federal judges, to predict relevant passages from
precedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. In 96% of
unseen test examples the correct target passage is among the top-10 predicted
passages. The same model is able to predict relevant precedent given a short

fundamental research problem in natural language processing. Explaining human
conversations poses a great challenge as it requires contextual understanding,
planning, inference, and several aspects of reasoning including causal,
temporal, and commonsense reasoning. In this work, we introduce CIDER -- a
manually curated dataset that contains dyadic dialogue explanations in the form
of implicit and explicit knowledge triplets inferred using contextual
commonsense inference. Extracting such rich explanations from conversations can
be conducive to improving several downstream applications. The annotated
triplets are categorized by the type of commonsense knowledge present (e.g.,
causal, conditional, temporal). We set up three different tasks conditioned on
the annotated dataset: Dialogue-level Natural Language Inference, Span
Extraction, and Multi-choice Span Selection. Baseline results obtained with
transformer-based models reveal that the tasks are difficult, paving the way
for promising future research. The dataset and the baseline implementations are

                                        <span>German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) forms
which differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, the
present indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports of
football matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective past
tense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core and
are licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occur
in. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script and
specific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. This
allows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, they
shift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genre
that comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decode
them. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning of
these phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution,
grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors are
Aktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with other
TAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of the
comprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have only
been partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored in
German.</span>

                                        <span>Social media platforms provide users the freedom of expression and a medium
to exchange information and express diverse opinions. Unfortunately, this has
also resulted in the growth of abusive content with the purpose of
discriminating people and targeting the most vulnerable communities such as
immigrants, LGBT, Muslims, Jews and women. Because abusive language is
subjective in nature, there might be highly polarizing topics or events
involved in the annotation of abusive contents such as hate speech (HS).
Therefore, we need novel approaches to model conflicting perspectives and
opinions coming from people with different personal and demographic
backgrounds. In this paper, we present an in-depth study to model polarized
opinions coming from different communities under the hypothesis that similar
characteristics (ethnicity, social background, culture etc.) can influence the
perspectives of annotators on a certain phenomenon. We believe that by relying
on this information, we can divide the annotators into groups sharing similar
perspectives. We can create separate gold standards, one for each group, to
train state-of-the-art deep learning models. We can employ an ensemble approach
to combine the perspective-aware classifiers from different groups to an
inclusive model. We also propose a novel resource, a multi-perspective English
language dataset annotated according to different sub-categories relevant for
characterising online abuse: hate speech, aggressiveness, offensiveness and
stereotype. By training state-of-the-art deep learning models on this novel
resource, we show how our approach improves the prediction performance of a
state-of-the-art supervised classifier.</span>

                                        <span>This work originates from the observation that today&#x27;s state of the art
statistical language models are impressive not only for their performance, but
also - and quite crucially - because they are built entirely from correlations
in unstructured text data. The latter observation prompts a fundamental
question that lies at the heart of this paper: What mathematical structure
exists in unstructured text data? We put forth enriched category theory as a
natural answer. We show that sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet, such
as those found in a corpus of text, form a category enriched over
probabilities. We then address a second fundamental question: How can this
information be stored and modeled in a way that preserves the categorical
structure? We answer this by constructing a functor from our enriched category
of text to a particular enriched category of reduced density operators. The
latter leverages the Loewner order on positive semidefinite operators, which
can further be interpreted as a toy example of entailment.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of dialog systems
research. Standard language evaluation metrics are known to be ineffective for
evaluating dialog. As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,
dialog-specific metrics that correlate better with human judgements. Due to the
fast pace of research, many of these metrics have been assessed on different
datasets and there has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between
them. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of recently
proposed dialog evaluation metrics on a number of datasets. In this paper, 17
different automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different datasets.
Furthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify
their respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the
turn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for
different dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types
of response generation models (i.e., generative, retrieval, simple models and
state-of-the-art models), (5) taking into account the similarity of different
metrics and (6) exploring combinations of different metrics. This comprehensive
assessment offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation metrics in
general. It also suggests how to best assess evaluation metrics and indicates
promising directions for future work.</span>

writers in the news domain to develop event-centric narratives. Given an
incomplete narrative that specifies a main event and a context, we aim to
retrieve news articles that discuss relevant events that would enable the

retrieval dataset construction procedure that relies on existing news articles
to simulate incomplete narratives and relevant articles. Experiments on two
datasets derived from this procedure show that state-of-the-art lexical and
semantic rankers are not sufficient for this task. We show that combining those
with a ranker that ranks articles by reverse chronological order outperforms
those rankers alone. We also perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative

                                        <span>We introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency
parsing problems (syntactic and discourse parsing) into a series of conditional
splitting decisions. Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability
distribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports
efficient top-down decoding, which is linear in number of nodes. The
conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference
facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured
inference. Crucially, for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation,
discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows
us to perform discourse parsing without requiring segmentation as a
pre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the

rely on text annotation, such as human generated captions or machine generated
automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the
Audio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a
shared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To
circumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations
from randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train
AVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,
and evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet&#x27;s learned
representations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn
audio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly
processes raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a
multi-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval. Our code,
data, and trained models will be released at avlnet.csail.mit.edu</span>

approach to convert words to vectors. It has been a focal point to understand
how much of the semantics of the the words has been transferred into embedding
vectors. This is important as the embedding is going to be used as the basis
for downstream NLP applications and it will be costly to evaluate the
application end-to-end in order to identify quality of the used embedding
model. Generally the word embeddings are evaluated through a number of tests,
including analogy test. In this paper we propose a test framework for Persian
embedding models. Persian is a low resource language and there is no rich
semantic benchmark to evaluate word embedding models for this language. In this
paper we introduce an evaluation framework including a hand crafted Persian SAT
based analogy dataset, a colliquial test set (specific to Persian) and a
benchmark to study the impact of various parameters on the semantic evaluation
task.</span>

Reinforcement Iterative Sequence Editing (RISE) framework that optimizes the

able to pay attention to tokens that are related to conversational

function in two training methods of auto-regressive models, i.e., teacher
forcing and scheduled sampling. In this paper, we propose mixed cross entropy
loss (mixed CE) as a substitute for CE in both training approaches. In teacher
forcing, the model trained with CE regards the translation problem as a
one-to-one mapping process, while in mixed CE this process can be relaxed to
one-to-many. In scheduled sampling, we show that mixed CE has the potential to
encourage the training and testing behaviours to be similar to each other, more
effectively mitigating the exposure bias problem. We demonstrate the
superiority of mixed CE over CE on several machine translation datasets, WMT&#x27;16
Ro-En, WMT&#x27;16 Ru-En, and WMT&#x27;14 En-De in both teacher forcing and scheduled
sampling setups. Furthermore, in WMT&#x27;14 En-De, we also find mixed CE
consistently outperforms CE on a multi-reference set as well as a challenging
paraphrased reference set. We also found the model trained with mixed CE is
able to provide a better probability distribution defined over the translation

                                        <span>Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This
has motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language,
in order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential
weaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard
attention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by
constant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,
which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.
In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated
attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the
attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated
transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With
some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a
saturated transformer memory vector is $O(\log n)$, which implies saturated
transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard
to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer&#x27;s
effective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\log n)$.</span>

within the same timeframe is useful to a number of different tasks and
practitioners. A major question is how to evaluate the quality of such thematic
clusters. Here we create a corpus of microblog clusters from three different
domains and time windows and define the task of evaluating thematic coherence.
We provide annotation guidelines and human annotations of thematic coherence by
journalist experts. We subsequently investigate the efficacy of different
automated evaluation metrics for the task. We consider a range of metrics
including surface level metrics, ones for topic model coherence and text
generation metrics (TGMs). While surface level metrics perform well,
outperforming topic coherence metrics, they are not as consistent as TGMs. TGMs
are more reliable than all other metrics considered for capturing thematic
coherence in microblog clusters due to being less sensitive to the effect of
time windows.</span>

                                        <span>E-commerce stores collect customer feedback to let sellers learn about
customer concerns and enhance customer order experience. Because customer
feedback often contains redundant information, a concise summary of the
feedback can be generated to help sellers better understand the issues causing
customer dissatisfaction. Previous state-of-the-art abstractive text
summarization models make two major types of factual errors when producing
summaries from customer feedback, which are wrong entity detection (WED) and
incorrect product-defect description (IPD). In this work, we introduce a set of
methods to enhance the factual consistency of abstractive summarization on
customer feedback. We augment the training data with artificially corrupted
summaries, and use them as counterparts of the target summaries. We add a
contrastive loss term into the training objective so that the model learns to
avoid certain factual errors. Evaluation results show that a large portion of
WED and IPD errors are alleviated for BART and T5. Furthermore, our approaches
do not depend on the structure of the summarization model and thus are
generalizable to any abstractive summarization systems.</span>

aims to facilitate research on grounding words to images in their contextual
usage in language. The dataset consists of images selected to unambiguously
illustrate concepts expressed in sentences from movie subtitles. The dataset is
a valuable resource as (i) the images are aligned to text fragments rather than
whole sentences; (ii) multiple images are possible for a text fragment and a
sentence; (iii) the sentences are free-form and real-world like; (iv) the
parallel texts are multilingual. We set up a fill-in-the-blank game for humans
to evaluate the quality of the automatic image selection process of our
dataset. We show the utility of the dataset on two automatic tasks: (i)
fill-in-the blank; (ii) lexical translation. Results of the human evaluation
and automatic models demonstrate that images can be a useful complement to the
textual context. The dataset will benefit research on visual grounding of words
especially in the context of free-form sentences, and can be obtained from

                                        <span>To provide consistent emotional interaction with users, dialog systems should
be capable to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like
humans. However, most existing works focus on rendering specified emotions in
responses or empathetically respond to the emotion of users, yet the individual
difference in emotion expression is overlooked. This may lead to inconsistent
emotional expressions and disinterest users. To tackle this issue, we propose
to equip the dialog system with personality and enable it to automatically
select emotions in responses by simulating the emotion transition of humans in
conversation. In detail, the emotion of the dialog system is transitioned from
its preceding emotion in context. The transition is triggered by the preceding
dialog context and affected by the specified personality trait. To achieve
this, we first model the emotion transition in the dialog system as the
variation between the preceding emotion and the response emotion in the
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Then, we design neural networks
to encode the preceding dialog context and the specified personality traits to
compose the variation. Finally, the emotion for response is selected from the
sum of the preceding emotion and the variation. We construct a dialog dataset
with emotion and personality labels and conduct emotion prediction tasks for
evaluation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the
personality-affected emotion transition.</span>

challenge. Apart from many domain-independent text summarization algorithms
that can be used for this purpose, several algorithms have been developed
specifically for summarizing legal case documents. However, most of the
existing algorithms do not systematically incorporate domain knowledge that
specifies what information should ideally be present in a legal case document
summary. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised summarization
algorithm DELSumm which is designed to systematically incorporate guidelines
from legal experts into an optimization setup. We conduct detailed experiments
over case documents from the Indian Supreme Court. The experiments show that
our proposed unsupervised method outperforms several strong baselines in terms
of ROUGE scores, including both general summarization algorithms and
legal-specific ones. In fact, though our proposed algorithm is unsupervised, it
outperforms several supervised summarization models that are trained over
thousands of document-summary pairs.</span>

is their fragile out-of-domain generalization, which makes these models not
properly applicable to real-world general-purpose question answering problems.
In this paper, we leverage a zero-shot weighted ensemble method for improving
the robustness of out-of-domain generalization in MRC models. In the proposed
method, a weight estimation module is used to estimate out-of-domain weights,
and an ensemble module aggregate several base models&#x27; predictions based on
their weights. The experiments indicate that the proposed method not only
improves the final accuracy, but also is robust against domain changes.</span>

                                        <span>Building machine learning prediction models for a specific NLP task requires
sufficient training data, which can be difficult to obtain for low-resource
languages. Cross-lingual embeddings map word embeddings from a low-resource
language to a high-resource language so that a prediction model trained on data
from the high-resource language can also be used in the low-resource language.
To produce cross-lingual mappings of recent contextual embeddings, anchor
points between the embedding spaces have to be words in the same context. We
address this issue with a new method for creating datasets for cross-lingual
contextual alignments. Based on that, we propose novel cross-lingual mapping
methods for ELMo embeddings. Our linear mapping methods use existing vecmap and
MUSE alignments on contextual ELMo embeddings. Our new nonlinear ELMoGAN
mapping method is based on GANs and does not assume isomorphic embedding
spaces. We evaluate the proposed mapping methods on nine languages, using two
downstream tasks, NER and dependency parsing. The ELMoGAN method performs well
on the NER task, with low cross-lingual loss compared to direct training on
some languages. In the dependency parsing, linear alignment variants are more
successful.</span>

                                        <span>Text-to-Graph extraction aims to automatically extract information graphs
consisting of mentions and types from natural language texts. Existing
approaches, such as table filling and pairwise scoring, have shown impressive
performance on various information extraction tasks, but they are difficult to
scale to datasets with longer input texts because of their second-order
space/time complexities with respect to the input length. In this work, we
propose a Hybrid Span Generator (HySPA) that invertibly maps the information
graph to an alternating sequence of nodes and edge types, and directly
generates such sequences via a hybrid span decoder which can decode both the
spans and the types recurrently in linear time and space complexities.
Extensive experiments on the ACE05 dataset show that our approach also
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on the joint entity and relation
extraction task.</span>

                                        <span>Machine translation systems are vulnerable to domain mismatch, especially
when the task is low-resource. In this setting, out of domain translations are
often of poor quality and prone to hallucinations, due to the translation model
preferring to predict common words it has seen during training, as opposed to
the more uncommon ones from a different domain. We present two simple methods
for improving translation quality in this particular setting: First, we use
lexical shortlisting in order to restrict the neural network predictions by IBM
model computed alignments. Second, we perform $n$-best list reordering by
reranking all translations based on the amount they overlap with each other.
Our methods are computationally simpler and faster than alternative approaches,
and show a moderate success on low-resource settings with explicit out of
domain test sets. However, our methods lose their effectiveness when the domain
mismatch is too great, or in high resource setting.</span>

                                        <span>Experiments with pretrained models such as BERT are often based on a single
checkpoint. While the conclusions drawn apply to the artifact (i.e., the
particular instance of the model), it is not always clear whether they hold for
the more general procedure (which includes the model architecture, training
data, initialization scheme, and loss function). Recent work has shown that
re-running pretraining can lead to substantially different conclusions about
performance, suggesting that alternative evaluations are needed to make
principled statements about procedures. To address this question, we introduce
MultiBERTs: a set of 25 BERT-base checkpoints, trained with similar
hyper-parameters as the original BERT model but differing in random
initialization and data shuffling. The aim is to enable researchers to draw
robust and statistically justified conclusions about pretraining procedures.
The full release includes 25 fully trained checkpoints, as well as statistical
guidelines and a code library implementing our recommended hypothesis testing
methods. Finally, for five of these models we release a set of 28 intermediate
checkpoints in order to support research on learning dynamics.</span>

completely alleviated the need for labeled data, which is cumbersome to collect
for all target languages. Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is emerging as a
practical solution: pre-trained models later fine-tuned on one transfer
language exhibit surprising performance when tested on many target languages.
English is the dominant source language for transfer, as reinforced by popular
zero-shot benchmarks. However, this default choice has not been systematically
vetted. In our study, we compare English against other transfer languages for
fine-tuning, on two pre-trained multilingual models (mBERT and mT5) and
multiple classification and question answering tasks. We find that other
high-resource languages such as German and Russian often transfer more
effectively, especially when the set of target languages is diverse or unknown
a priori. Unexpectedly, this can be true even when the training sets were
automatically translated from English. This finding can have immediate impact
on multilingual zero-shot systems, and should inform future benchmark designs.</span>

                                        <span>To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing
number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled
source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods
assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which
ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple
source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster
R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which
can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power.
Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo
target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to
conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features,
respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second,
we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal
parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in
different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region
proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract
invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>High resolution images are widely used in our daily life, whereas high-speed
video capture is challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at
the high resolution mode. Digging deeper, the main bottleneck lies in the low
throughput of existing imaging systems. Towards this end, snapshot compressive
imaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of
imaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction.
During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a
single measurement. After this, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video
frames from the coded snapshot. Recently developed Plug-and-Play (PnP)
algorithms make it possible for SCI reconstruction in large-scale problems.
However, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI&#x27;s
wide application. In this paper, we build a novel hybrid coded aperture
snapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid
crystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement
a PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high quality
reconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we achieve
a 10-mega pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high
throughput of 4.6G voxels per second. Both simulation and real data experiments
verify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.</span>

automatic facial expression recognition is one of the challenging tasks due to
different uncertainties. However, it has been an active field of research for
many years. Nevertheless, efficiency and performance are yet essential aspects
for building robust systems. We proposed two models, EmoXNet which is an
ensemble learning technique for learning convoluted facial representations, and
EmoXNetLite which is a distillation technique that is useful for transferring
the knowledge from our ensemble model to an efficient deep neural network using
label-smoothen soft labels for able to effectively detect expressions in
real-time. Both of the techniques performed quite well, where the ensemble
model (EmoXNet) helped to achieve 85.07% test accuracy on FER2013 with FER+
annotations and 86.25% test accuracy on RAF-DB. Moreover, the distilled model

                                        <span>Acquiring accurate 3D annotated data for hand pose estimation is a
notoriously difficult problem. This typically requires complex multi-camera
setups and controlled conditions, which in turn creates a domain gap that is
hard to bridge to fully unconstrained settings. Encouraged by the success of
contrastive learning on image classification tasks, we propose a new
self-supervised method for the structured regression task of 3D hand pose
estimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled data for the purpose of
representation learning via a loss formulation that encourages the learned
feature representations to be invariant under any image transformation. For 3D
hand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have invariance to appearance
transformation such as color jitter. However, the task requires equivariance
under affine transformations, such as rotation and translation. To address this
issue, we propose an equivariant contrastive objective and demonstrate its
effectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose estimation. We experimentally
investigate the impact of invariant and equivariant contrastive objectives and
show that learning equivariant features leads to better representations for the
task of 3D hand pose estimation. Furthermore, we show that a standard
ResNet-152, trained on additional unlabeled data, attains an improvement of
$7.6\%$ in PA-EPE on FreiHAND and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance
without any task specific, specialized architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised contrastive learning has demonstrated great potential in
learning visual representations. Despite their success on various downstream
tasks such as image classification and object detection, self-supervised
pre-training for fine-grained scenarios is not fully explored. In this paper,
we first point out that current contrastive methods are prone to memorizing
background/foreground texture and therefore have a limitation in localizing the
foreground object. Analysis suggests that learning to extract discriminative
texture information and localization are equally crucial for self-supervised
pre-training under fine-grained scenarios. Based on our findings, we introduce
Cross-view Saliency Alignment (CVSA), a contrastive learning framework that
first crops and swaps saliency regions of images as a novel view generation and
then guides the model to localize on the foreground object via a cross-view
alignment loss. Extensive experiments on four popular fine-grained
classification benchmarks show that CVSA significantly improves the learned
representation.</span>

automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the
Audio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a
shared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To
circumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations
from randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train
AVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,
and evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet&#x27;s learned
representations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn
audio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly
processes raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a
multi-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval. Our code,

times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and
dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with
compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal
MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices
for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording
the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes
it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods.
To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal
Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised
super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice
acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition
along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate
pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution
network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time
series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data.
Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method
outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image
quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.</span>

learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve
the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning
rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective
adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer
problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic
momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. At the
same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by
using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in
estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated
BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still
achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ without large
batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm
(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our
methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of
adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum
and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence
analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel
optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel
optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.</span>

                                        <span>Hash coding has been widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for
large-scale image retrieval. Given semantic annotations such as class labels
and pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and
generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images
may contain undefined semantic labels, which we call unseen images, zeor-shot
hashing techniques have been studied. However, existing zeor-shot hashing
methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle
multi-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive
zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In
order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge
is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then,
pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for
training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data.
Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that,
the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the
competing methods.</span>

therapeutic efficacy of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite tremendous efforts
made within the research community, single-camera video recordings are mainly
used for such analysis. Because of the potential to create rich descriptions of
mouse social behaviors, the use of multi-view video recordings for rodent
observations is increasingly receiving much attention. However, identifying
social behaviours from various views is still challenging due to the lack of
correspondence across data sources. To address this problem, we here propose a
novel multiview latent-attention and dynamic discriminative model that jointly
learns view-specific and view-shared sub-structures, where the former captures
unique dynamics of each view whilst the latter encodes the interaction between
the views. Furthermore, a novel multi-view latent-attention variational
autoencoder model is introduced in learning the acquired features, enabling us
to learn discriminative features in each view. Experimental results on the
standard CRMI13 and our multi-view Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB)
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the other state of the arts
technologies and effectively deals with the imbalanced data problem.</span>

prompted researchers to develop increasingly precise and accurate data-driven
models for land cover and crop classification (LC&amp;CC). Moreover, with the
introduction of self-attention and introspection mechanisms, deep learning
approaches have shown promising results in processing long temporal sequences
in the multi-spectral domain with a contained computational request.
Nevertheless, most practical applications cannot rely on labeled data, and in
the field, surveys are a time consuming solution that poses strict limitations
to the number of collected samples. Moreover, atmospheric conditions and
specific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap
that does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available
dataset to the area of interest. In this paper, we investigate adversarial
training of deep neural networks to bridge the domain discrepancy between
distinct geographical zones. In particular, we perform a thorough analysis of
domain adaptation applied to challenging multi-spectral, multi-temporal data,
accurately highlighting the advantages of adapting state-of-the-art
self-attention based models for LC&amp;CC to different target zones where labeled
data are not available. Extensive experimentation demonstrated significant
performance and generalization gain in applying domain-adversarial training to
source and target regions with marked dissimilarities between the distribution

healthy and abnormal conditions results in isolated analyses of pathologies,
that can not handle realistic multi-pathology scenarios. In this work, we
explore how to learn more for free, from limited data through solving a WCE
multicentric, multi-pathology classification problem. Learning more implies to
learning more than full supervision would allow with the same data. This is
done by combining self supervision with full supervision, under multi task
learning. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the Human Visual System (HVS)
in designing self supervision tasks and investigate if seemingly ineffectual
signals within the data itself can be exploited to gain performance, if so,
which signals would be better than others. Further, we present our analysis of

natural language feedback). We propose a SynthTriplet GAN framework which
resolves this task by expanding the multimodal query with a synthetically

as an anchor to directly optimize for embedding distances of generated and

illustration with synthetic image with the focus on customization and user

                                        <span>Monocular 3D object detection is an important task in autonomous driving. It
can be easily intractable where there exists ego-car pose change w.r.t. ground
plane. This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and
slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods
on open datasets neglect the camera pose information, which inevitably results
in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The
perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for
industrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera
pose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically,
the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting
vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify
perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works
independent of the extrinsic parameter variations and produces accurate results
in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing
monocular detectors fail to handle. Experiments demonstrate our method yields
the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large
margin on both KITTI 3D and nuScenes datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (multi-source UDA) aims to learn
a model from several labeled source domains while performing well on a
different target domain where only unlabeled data are available at training
time. To align source and target features distributions, several recent works
use source and target explicit statistics matching such as features moments or
class centroids. Yet, these approaches do not guarantee class conditional
distributions alignment across domains. In this work, we propose a new
framework called Contrastive Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (CMSDA) for
multi-source UDA that addresses this limitation. Discriminative features are
learned from interpolated source examples via cross entropy minimization and
from target examples via consistency regularization and hard pseudo-labeling.
Simultaneously, interpolated source examples are leveraged to align source
class conditional distributions through an interpolated version of the
supervised contrastive loss. This alignment leads to more general and
transferable features which further improve the generalization on the target
domain. Extensive experiments have been carried out on three standard
multi-source UDA datasets where our method reports state-of-the-art results.</span>

the widespread RGB images. A systematic study and comparison of more than 25
methods has revealed that most of the data-driven deep learning methods are
superior to prior-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and quality
despite lower speeds. This comprehensive review can serve as a fruitful
reference source for peer researchers, thus further inspiring future
development directions in related domains.</span>

                                        <span>Face anti-spoofing approaches based on domain generalization (DG) have drawn
growing attention due to their robustness for unseen scenarios. Previous
methods treat each sample from multiple domains indiscriminately during the
training process, and endeavor to extract a common feature space to improve the
generalization. However, due to complex and biased data distribution, directly
treating them equally will corrupt the generalization ability. To settle the
issue, we propose a novel Dual Reweighting Domain Generalization (DRDG)
framework which iteratively reweights the relative importance between samples
to further improve the generalization. Concretely, Sample Reweighting Module is
first proposed to identify samples with relatively large domain bias, and
reduce their impact on the overall optimization. Afterwards, Feature
Reweighting Module is introduced to focus on these samples and extract more
domain-irrelevant features via a self-distilling mechanism. Combined with the
domain discriminator, the iteration of the two modules promotes the extraction
of generalized features. Extensive experiments and visualizations are presented
to demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method against the
state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

                                        <span>Robust and accurate nuclei centroid detection is important for the
understanding of biological structures in fluorescence microscopy images.
Existing automated nuclei localization methods face three main challenges: (1)
Most of object detection methods work only on 2D images and are difficult to
extend to 3D volumes; (2) Segmentation-based models can be used on 3D volumes
but it is computational expensive for large microscopy volumes and they have
difficulty distinguishing different instances of objects; (3) Hand annotated
ground truth is limited for 3D microscopy volumes. To address these issues, we
present a scalable approach for nuclei centroid detection of 3D microscopy
volumes. We describe the RCNN-SliceNet to detect 2D nuclei centroids for each
slice of the volume from different directions and 3D agglomerative hierarchical
clustering (AHC) is used to estimate the 3D centroids of nuclei in a volume.
The model was trained with the synthetic microscopy data generated using
Spatially Constrained Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (SpCycleGAN) and
tested on different types of real 3D microscopy data. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately count and detect
the nuclei centroids in a 3D microscopy volume.</span>

given its impact on human interactions. Thus, people normally pay attention to
both what their interlocutors are saying and also to their visual appearances,
including faces, to try to find any signs that indicate whether the person is
telling the truth or not. While automatic lie detection may help us to
understand this lying characteristics, current systems are still fairly
limited, partly due to lack of adequate datasets to evaluate their performance
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we have collected an annotated dataset of
facial images, comprising both 2D and 3D information of several participants
during a card game that encourages players to lie. Using our collected dataset,
We evaluated several types of machine learning-based lie detectors in terms of
their generalization, person-specific and cross-domain experiments. Our results
show that models based on deep learning achieve the best accuracy, reaching up
to 57\% for the generalization task and 63\% when dealing with a single
participant. Finally, we also highlight the limitation of the deep learning
based lie detector when dealing with cross-domain lie detection tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Robot manipulation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a
challenging problem due to the variety of shapes, materials, arrangements and
lighting conditions. Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust
perception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across
various lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we
propose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.
The underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural
network using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation
masks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as
output. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo
sub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection,
unknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and
significantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor.
By inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can
be used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and
hard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments.
In unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D
network and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects.
However, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent)
objects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust
manipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown
environments.</span>

recently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by
their high representation ability for extracting informative features from
input images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep
architectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the
depth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between
shortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present
an augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable
parameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational
costs, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant
projection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
brings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers
without obviously increasing their parameters and FLOPs.</span>

High-Resolution (HR) Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). The image cropping
operations, commonly used for training neural networks, limit the perception of
long-range context information in large RSIs. To break this limitation, we
propose a Wider-Context Network (WiCNet) for the semantic segmentation of HR
RSIs. In the WiCNet, apart from a conventional feature extraction network to
aggregate the local information, an extra context branch is designed to
explicitly model the context information in a larger image area. The
information between the two branches is communicated through a Context
Transformer, which is a novel design derived from the Vision Transformer to
model the long-range context correlations. Ablation studies and comparative
experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Additionally, we present a new Beijing Land-Use (BLU)
dataset. This is a large-scale HR satellite dataset provided with high-quality
and fine-grained reference labels, which we hope will boost future studies in
this field.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, Word-level Sign Language Recognition (WSLR) research has
gained popularity in the computer vision community, and thus various approaches
have been proposed. Among these approaches, the method using I3D network
achieves the highest recognition accuracy on large public datasets for WSLR.
However, the method with I3D only utilizes appearance information of the upper
body of the signers to recognize sign language words. On the other hand, in
WSLR, the information of local regions, such as the hand shape and facial
expression, and the positional relationship among the body and both hands are
important. Thus in this work, we utilized local region images of both hands and
face, along with skeletal information to capture local information and the
positions of both hands relative to the body, respectively. In other words, we
propose a novel multi-stream WSLR framework, in which a stream with local
region images and a stream with skeletal information are introduced by
extending I3D network to improve the recognition accuracy of WSLR. From the
experimental results on WLASL dataset, it is evident that the proposed method
has achieved about 15% improvement in the Top-1 accuracy than the existing
conventional methods.</span>

competitive results for visual tasks, but fail to consider high-level local
pattern information in input images. In this paper, we present a generic
Dual-stream Network (DS-Net) to fully explore the representation capacity of
local and global pattern features for image classification. Our DS-Net can
simultaneously calculate fine-grained and integrated features and efficiently
fuse them. Specifically, we propose an Intra-scale Propagation module to
process two different resolutions in each block and an Inter-Scale Alignment
module to perform information interaction across features at dual scales.
Besides, we also design a Dual-stream FPN (DS-FPN) to further enhance
contextual information for downstream dense predictions. Without bells and
whistles, the propsed DS-Net outperforms Deit-Small by 2.4% in terms of top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1k and achieves state-of-the-art performance over other
Vision Transformers and ResNets. For object detection and instance
segmentation, DS-Net-Small respectively outperforms ResNet-50 by 6.4% and 5.5 %
in terms of mAP on MSCOCO 2017, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art
scheme, which significantly demonstrates its potential to be a general backbone
in vision tasks. The code will be released soon.</span>

                                        <span>Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to
predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source
task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been
widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major
challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the
cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this
problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of
transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.
In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score
that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in
OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the
joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal
transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and
label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative
conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,
respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability
metrics on average.</span>

                                        <span>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can decrease the amount of required labeled
image data and thus the cost for deep learning. Most SSL methods only consider
a clear distinction between classes but in many real-world datasets, this clear
distinction is not given due to intra- or interobserver variability. This
variability can lead to different annotations per image. Thus many images have
ambiguous annotations and their label needs to be considered &quot;fuzzy&quot;. This
fuzziness of labels must be addressed as it will limit the performance of
Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and deep learning in general. We propose
Semi-Supervised Classification &amp; Clustering (S2C2) which can extend many deep
SSL algorithms. S2C2 can estimate the fuzziness of a label and applies SSL as a
classification to certainly labeled data while creating distinct clusters for
images with similar but fuzzy labels. We show that S2C2 results in median 7.4%
better F1-score for classifications and 5.4% lower inner distance of clusters
across multiple SSL algorithms and datasets while being more interpretable due
to the fuzziness estimation of our method. Overall, a combination of
Semi-Supervised Learning with our method S2C2 leads to better handling of the
fuzziness of labels and thus real-world datasets.</span>

within a Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) solution using a brightfield microscope.
However, this method takes a long time, is based on the experience of the
clinician, and has a low accuracy. With the increase of neural network
applications in the field of clinical microscopy it is now possible to automate
such manual processes increasing both efficiency and accuracy. This study
presents a deep neural network structure that enables the rapid solutions for
these problems and can perform automatic fungi detection in grayscale images
without colorants. Microscopic images of 81 fungi and 235 ceratine were
collected. Then, smaller patches were extracted containing 2062 fungi and 2142
ceratine. In order to detect fungus and ceratine, two models were created one
of which was a custom neural network and the other was based on the VGG16
architecture. The developed custom model had 99.84% accuracy, and an area under
the curve (AUC) value of 1.00, while the VGG16 model had 98.89% accuracy and an
AUC value of 0.99. However, average accuracy and AUC value of clinicians is
72.8% and 0.87 respectively. This deep learning model allows the development of
an automated system that can detect fungi within microscopic images.</span>

                                        <span>Temporal language grounding (TLG) is a fundamental and challenging problem
for vision and language understanding. Existing methods mainly focus on fully
supervised setting with temporal boundary labels for training, which, however,
suffers expensive cost of annotation. In this work, we are dedicated to weakly
supervised TLG, where multiple description sentences are given to an untrimmed
video without temporal boundary labels. In this task, it is critical to learn a
strong cross-modal semantic alignment between sentence semantics and visual
content. To this end, we introduce a novel weakly supervised temporal adjacent
network (WSTAN) for temporal language grounding. Specifically, WSTAN learns
cross-modal semantic alignment by exploiting temporal adjacent network in a
multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm, with a whole description paragraph
as input. Moreover, we integrate a complementary branch into the framework,
which explicitly refines the predictions with pseudo supervision from the MIL
stage. An additional self-discriminating loss is devised on both the MIL branch
and the complementary branch, aiming to enhance semantic discrimination by
self-supervising. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used
benchmark datasets, \emph{i.e.}, ActivityNet-Captions, Charades-STA, and
DiDeMo, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</span>

classes are generated daily, which raise an urgent demand for video
classification methods that can continuously update new classes while
maintaining the knowledge of old videos with limited storage and computing
resources. In this paper, we summarize this task as \textit{Class-Incremental
Video Classification (CIVC)} and propose a novel framework to address it. As a
subarea of incremental learning tasks, the challenge of \textit{catastrophic
forgetting} is unavoidable in CIVC. To better alleviate it, we utilize some
characteristics of videos. First, we decompose the spatio-temporal knowledge
before distillation rather than treating it as a whole in the knowledge
transfer process; trajectory is also used to refine the decomposition. Second,
we propose a dual granularity exemplar selection method to select and store
representative video instances of old classes and key-frames inside videos
under a tight storage budget. We benchmark our method and previous SOTA
class-incremental learning methods on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics

                                        <span>In this work, we present a lightweight, tightly-coupled deep depth network
and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system, which can provide accurate state
estimates and dense depth maps of the immediate surroundings. Leveraging the
proposed lightweight Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for depth
inference and encoding, we provide the network with previously marginalized
sparse features from VIO to increase the accuracy of initial depth prediction
and generalization capability. The compact encoded depth maps are then updated
jointly with navigation states in a sliding window estimator in order to
provide the dense local scene geometry. We additionally propose a novel method
to obtain the CVAE&#x27;s Jacobian which is shown to be more than an order of
magnitude faster than previous works, and we additionally leverage
First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation. As opposed to previous
works relying on completely dense residuals, we propose to only provide sparse
measurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation
that our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve
the estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose
estimation accuracy, and we show that it can run in real-time with
single-thread execution while utilizing GPU acceleration only for the network
and code Jacobian.</span>

                                        <span>Resolution in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is typically bounded
by the receptive field size through filter sizes, and subsampling layers or
strided convolutions on feature maps. The optimal resolution may vary
significantly depending on the dataset. Modern CNNs hard-code their resolution
hyper-parameters in the network architecture which makes tuning such
hyper-parameters cumbersome. We propose to do away with hard-coded resolution
hyper-parameters and aim to learn the appropriate resolution from data. We use
scale-space theory to obtain a self-similar parametrization of filters and make
use of the N-Jet: a truncated Taylor series to approximate a filter by a
learned combination of Gaussian derivative filters. The parameter sigma of the
Gaussian basis controls both the amount of detail the filter encodes and the
spatial extent of the filter. Since sigma is a continuous parameter, we can
optimize it with respect to the loss. The proposed N-Jet layer achieves
comparable performance when used in state-of-the art architectures, while
learning the correct resolution in each layer automatically. We evaluate our
N-Jet layer on both classification and segmentation, and we show that learning
sigma is especially beneficial for inputs at multiple sizes.</span>

                                        <span>Real-time video deblurring still remains a challenging task due to the
complexity of spatially and temporally varying blur itself and the requirement
of low computational cost. To improve the network efficiency, we adopt residual
dense blocks into RNN cells, so as to efficiently extract the spatial features
of the current frame. Furthermore, a global spatio-temporal attention module is
proposed to fuse the effective hierarchical features from past and future
frames to help better deblur the current frame. Another issue needs to be
addressed urgently is the lack of a real-world benchmark dataset. Thus, we
contribute a novel dataset (BSD) to the community, by collecting paired
blurry/sharp video clips using a co-axis beam splitter acquisition system.
Experimental results show that the proposed method (ESTRNN) can achieve better
deblurring performance both quantitatively and qualitatively with less
computational cost against state-of-the-art video deblurring methods. In
addition, cross-validation experiments between datasets illustrate the high
generality of BSD over the synthetic datasets. The code and dataset are
released at https://github.com/zzh-tech/ESTRNN.</span>

                                        <span>Many man-made objects are characterised by a shape that is symmetric along
one or more planar directions. Estimating the location and orientation of such
symmetry planes can aid many tasks such as estimating the overall orientation
of an object of interest or performing shape completion, where a partial scan
of an object is reflected across the estimated symmetry plane in order to
obtain a more detailed shape. Many methods processing 3D data rely on expensive
3D convolutions. In this paper we present an alternative novel encoding that
instead slices the data along the height dimension and passes it sequentially
to a 2D convolutional recurrent regression scheme. The method also comprises a
differentiable least squares step, allowing for end-to-end accurate and fast
processing of both full and partial scans of symmetric objects. We use this
approach to efficiently handle 3D inputs to design a method to estimate planar
reflective symmetries. We show that our approach has an accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art techniques on the task of planar reflective symmetry
estimation on full synthetic objects. Additionally, we show that it can be
deployed on partial scans of objects in a real-world pipeline to improve the
outputs of a 3D object detector.</span>

graphs. We generalize a previously known distance measure on graphs (Graph
Diffusion Distance), thereby allowing it to be tuned to minimize an arbitrary
loss function. Because all steps involved in calculating this modified GDD are
differentiable, we demonstrate that it is possible for a small neural network
model to learn edge weights which minimize loss. GDD alone does not effectively
discriminate between graphs constructed from shoot apical meristem images of
wild-type vs. mutant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} specimens. However, training
edge weights and kernel parameters with contrastive loss produces a learned
distance metric with large margins between these graph categories. We
demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple
k-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also
demonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis:
once trained, we use our model to compute the distance between the biological
graphs and a set of graphs output by a cell division simulator. This allows us
to identify simulation parameter regimes which are similar to each class of
graph in our original dataset.</span>

to another domain without the need for new annotation of the target data. Our
method uses AlignedReID++ as the baseline, trained using a Triplet loss with

intersection into the forecast of cyclist trajectories. We extract features
from image and optical flow (OF) sequences using 3D convolutional neural
networks (3D-ConvNet) and combine them with features extracted from the

additional information, we are able to improve positional accuracy by about 7.5
% for our test dataset and by up to 22 % for specific motion types compared to
a method solely based on past trajectories. Furthermore, we compare the use of
image sequences to the use of OF sequences as additional information, showing
that OF alone leads to significant improvements in positional accuracy. By
training and testing our methods using a real-world dataset recorded at a

our view, solving this problem requires learning of contextual semantic priors,
a challenging endeavour given the spatial and semantic variability of indoor
environments. Current methods learn to implicitly encode these priors through
goal-oriented navigation policy functions operating on spatial representations
that are limited to the agent&#x27;s observable areas. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that actively learns to generate semantic maps outside the
field of view of the agent and leverages the uncertainty over the semantic
classes in the unobserved areas to decide on long term goals. We demonstrate
that through this spatial prediction strategy, we are able to learn semantic
priors in scenes that can be leveraged in unknown environments. Additionally,
we show how different objectives can be defined by balancing exploration with
exploitation during searching for semantic targets. Our method is validated in
the visually realistic environments offered by the Matterport3D dataset and
show state of the art results on the object goal navigation task.</span>

                                        <span>Adaptive gradient methods have shown excellent performance for solving many
machine learning problems. Although multiple adaptive methods were recently
studied, they mainly focus on either empirical or theoretical aspects and also
only work for specific problems by using specific adaptive learning rates. It
is desired to design a universal framework for practical algorithms of adaptive
gradients with theoretical guarantee to solve general problems. To fill this
gap, we propose a faster and universal framework of adaptive gradients (i.e.,
SUPER-ADAM) by introducing a universal adaptive matrix that includes most
existing adaptive gradient forms. Moreover, our framework can flexibly
integrates the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, our
novel framework provides the convergence analysis support for adaptive gradient
methods under the nonconvex setting. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our
new algorithm can achieve the best known complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of
nonconvex optimization, which matches the lower bound for stochastic smooth
nonconvex optimization. In numerical experiments, we employ various deep
learning tasks to validate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
existing adaptive algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Existing computer vision research in categorization struggles with
fine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class
variances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by
locating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the
complete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its
strong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image
classification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without
requiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention
mechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the
model&#x27;s capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting
with four popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars,
Stanford Dogs, and FGVC7 Plant Pathology. We also prove our model&#x27;s
interpretability via qualitative results.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, different researchers have found that the gallery composition of a
face database can induce performance differentials to facial identification
systems in which a probe image is compared against up to all stored reference
images to reach a biometric decision. This negative effect is referred to as
&quot;watchlist imbalance effect&quot;. In this work, we present a method to
theoretically estimate said effect for a biometric identification system given
its verification performance across demographic groups and the composition of
the used gallery. Further, we report results for identification experiments on
differently composed demographic subsets, i.e. females and males, of the public
academic MORPH database using the open-source ArcFace face recognition system.
It is shown that the database composition has a huge impact on performance
differentials in biometric identification systems, even if performance
differentials are less pronounced in the verification scenario. This study
represents the first detailed analysis of the watchlist imbalance effect which
is expected to be of high interest for future research in the field of facial
recognition.</span>

taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identify
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple
and plug-and-play open set recognition modules that can be attached to
pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for
failure recognition in object recognition tasks. We conduct a thorough
evaluation of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art open set
algorithms, finding that GeMOS either outperforms or is statistically
indistinguishable from more complex and costly models.</span>

Hessian for a Riemannian manifold that is a quotient of a manifold embedded in
an inner product space with a non-constant metric function. Together with a
classical formula for projection, this allows us to evaluate Riemannian
gradient and Hessian for several families of metrics on classical manifolds,
including a family of metrics on Stiefel manifolds connecting both the constant
and canonical ambient metrics with closed-form geodesics. Using these formulas,
we derive Riemannian optimization frameworks on quotients of Stiefel manifolds,
including flag manifolds, and a new family of complete quotient metrics on the
manifold of positive-semidefinite matrices of fixed rank, considered as a
quotient of a product of Stiefel and positive-definite matrix manifold with
affine-invariant metrics. The method is procedural, and in many instances, the
Riemannian gradient and Hessian formulas could be derived by symbolic calculus.
The method extends the list of potential metrics that could be used in manifold
optimization and machine learning.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer attention architectures, similar to those developed for natural
language processing, have recently proved efficient also in vision, either in
conjunction with or as a replacement for convolutional layers. Typically,
visual attention is inserted in the network architecture as a (series of)
feedforward self-attention module(s), with mutual key-query agreement as the
main selection and routing operation. However efficient, this strategy is only
vaguely compatible with the way that attention is implemented in biological
brains: as a separate and unified network of attentional selection regions,
receiving inputs from and exerting modulatory influence on the entire hierarchy
of visual regions. Here, we report experiments with a simple such attention
system that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks,
with relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer
of the network produces a key-query vector pair; all queries are then pooled
into a global attention query. On the next iteration, the match between each
key and the global attention query modulates the network&#x27;s activations --
emphasizing or silencing the locations that agree or disagree (respectively)
with the global attention system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this
brain-inspired Global Attention Agreement network (GAttANet) for various
convolutional backbones (from a simple 5-layer toy model to a standard ResNet50
architecture) and datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Imagenet-1k). Each time, our
global attention system improves accuracy over the corresponding baseline.</span>

noisy output using a U-Net model trained on denoising at various noise levels.
SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different

on a standard 8X face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ, comparing with SOTA
GAN methods. SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic

                                        <span>This work is an update of a previous paper on the same topic published a few
years ago. With the dramatic progress in generative modeling, a suite of new
quantitative and qualitative techniques to evaluate models has emerged.
Although some measures such as Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance,
Precision-Recall, and Perceptual Path Length are relatively more popular, GAN
evaluation is not a settled issue and there is still room for improvement.
Here, I describe new dimensions that are becoming important in assessing models
(e.g. bias and fairness) and discuss the connection between GAN evaluation and
deepfakes. These are important areas of concern in the machine learning
community today and progress in GAN evaluation can help mitigate them.</span>

pursue better compression efficiency beyond the latest Versatile Video Coding
(VVC), where we encode intra frames at original high resolution (HR), compress
inter frames at a lower resolution (LR), and then super-resolve decoded LR
inter frames with the help from preceding HR intra and neighboring LR inter
frames. For a LR inter frame, a motion alignment and aggregation network (MAN)
is devised to produce temporally aggregated motion representation (AMR) for the
guarantee of temporal smoothness; Another texture compensation network (TCN)
inputs decoded HR intra frame, re-sampled HR intra frame, and this LR inter
frame to generate multiscale affinity map (MAM) and multiscale texture
representation (MTR) for better augmenting spatial details; Finally,
similarity-driven fusion synthesizes AMR, MTR, MAM to upscale LR inter frame
for the removal of compression and resolution re-sampling noises. We enhance
the VVC using proposed CRS, showing averaged 8.76% and 11.93% Bj{\o}ntegaard
Delta Rate (BD-Rate) gains against the latest VVC anchor in Random Access (RA)
and Low-delay P (LDP) settings respectively. In addition, experimental
comparisons to the state-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) based VVC enhancement
methods, and ablation studies are conducted to further report superior
efficiency and generalization of proposed algorithm. All materials will be made

                                        <span>In applications such as object tracking, time-series data inevitably carry
missing observations. Following the success of deep learning-based models for
various sequence learning tasks, these models increasingly replace classic
approaches in object tracking applications for inferring the object motions
state. While traditional tracking approaches can deal with missing
observations, most of their deep counterparts are, by default, not suited for
this.

Towards this end, this paper introduces a transformer-based approach for
handling missing observations in variable input length trajectory data. The
model is formed indirectly by successively increasing the complexity of the
demanded inference tasks. Starting from reproducing noise-free trajectories,
the model then learns to infer trajectories from noisy inputs. By providing
missing tokens, binary-encoded missing events, the model learns to in-attend to
missing data and infers a complete trajectory conditioned on the remaining
inputs. In the case of a sequence of successive missing events, the model then
acts as a pure prediction model. The model&#x27;s abilities are demonstrated on
synthetic data and real-world data reflecting prototypical object tracking
scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural network (CNN) have proven its success for semantic
segmentation, which is a core task of emerging industrial applications such as
autonomous driving. However, most progress in semantic segmentation of urban
scenes is reported on standard scenarios, i.e., daytime scenes with favorable
illumination conditions. In practical applications, the outdoor weather and
illumination are changeable, e.g., cloudy and nighttime, which results in a
significant drop of semantic segmentation accuracy of CNN only trained with
daytime data. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network
(namely Mutual-GAN) to alleviate the accuracy decline when daytime-trained
neural network is applied to videos captured under adverse weather conditions.
The proposed Mutual-GAN adopts mutual information constraint to preserve
image-objects during cross-weather adaptation, which is an unsolved problem for
most unsupervised image-to-image translation approaches (e.g., CycleGAN). The
proposed Mutual-GAN is evaluated on two publicly available driving video
datasets (i.e., CamVid and SYNTHIA). The experimental results demonstrate that
our Mutual-GAN can yield visually plausible translated images and significantly
improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of daytime-trained deep learning
network while processing videos under challenging weathers.</span>

outlining different tissue types in digitized histological specimen. This
semantic segmentation provides a basis for many follow-up analyses and can
potentially guide subsequent medical decisions. Due to their large size,
whole-slide-images typically have to be divided into smaller patches which are
then analyzed individually using machine learning-based approaches. Thereby,
local dependencies of image regions get lost and since a whole-slide-image
comprises many thousands of such patches this process is inherently slow. We
propose to subdivide the image into coherent regions prior to classification by
grouping visually similar adjacent image pixels into larger segments, i.e.
superpixels. Afterwards, only a random subset of patches per superpixel is
classified and patch labels are combined into a single superpixel label. The
algorithm has been developed and validated on a dataset of 159 hand-annotated
whole-slide-images of colon resections and its performance has been compared to
a standard patch-based approach. The algorithm shows an average speed-up of 41%
on the test data and the overall accuracy is increased from 93.8% to 95.7%. We
additionally propose a metric for identifying superpixels with an uncertain
classification so they can be excluded from further analysis. Finally, we
evaluate two potential medical applications, namely tumor area estimation
including tumor invasive margin generation and tumor composition analysis.</span>

                                        <span>ML-enabled software systems have been incorporated in many public
demonstrations for automated driving (AD) systems. Such solutions have also
been considered as a crucial approach to aim at SAE Level 5 systems, where the
passengers in such vehicles do not have to interact with the system at all
anymore. Already in 2016, Nvidia demonstrated a complete end-to-end approach
for training the complete software stack covering perception, planning and
decision making, and the actual vehicle control. While such approaches show the
great potential of such ML-enabled systems, there have also been demonstrations
where already changes to single pixels in a video frame can potentially lead to
completely different decisions with dangerous consequences. In this paper, a
structured analysis has been conducted to explore video degradation effects on
the performance of an ML-enabled pedestrian detector. Firstly, a baseline of
applying YOLO to 1,026 frames with pedestrian annotations in the KITTI Vision
Benchmark Suite has been established. Next, video degradation candidates for
each of these frames were generated using the leading video codecs libx264,
libx265, Nvidia HEVC, and AV1: 52 frames for the various compression presets
for color and gray-scale frames resulting in 104 degradation candidates per
original KITTI frame and 426,816 images in total. YOLO was applied to each
image to compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric to compare the
performance with the original baseline. While aggressively lossy compression
settings result in significant performance drops as expected, it was also
observed that some configurations actually result in slightly better IoU
results compared to the baseline. The findings show that carefully chosen lossy
video configurations preserve a decent performance of particular ML-enabled
systems while allowing for substantial savings when storing or transmitting
data.</span>

capability that robots need when functioning in unstructured environments.
While previous methods have exhibited promising results, they still tend to
provide incorrect results in highly cluttered scenes. We postulate that a
network architecture that encodes relations between objects at a high-level can
be beneficial. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel framework that refines
the output of such methods by utilizing a graph-based representation of
instance masks. We train deep networks capable of sampling smart perturbations
to the segmentations, and a graph neural network, which can encode relations
between objects, to evaluate the perturbed segmentations. Our proposed method
is orthogonal to previous works and achieves state-of-the-art performance when
combined with them. We demonstrate an application that uses uncertainty
estimates generated by our method to guide a manipulator, leading to efficient
understanding of cluttered scenes. Code, models, and video can be found at

                                        <span>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) learns one-class classifiers exclusively
with normal (i.e., healthy) images to detect any abnormal (i.e., unhealthy)
samples that do not conform to the expected normal patterns. UAD has two main
advantages over its fully supervised counterpart. Firstly, it is able to
directly leverage large datasets available from health screening programs that
contain mostly normal image samples, avoiding the costly manual labelling of
abnormal samples and the subsequent issues involved in training with extremely
class-imbalanced data. Further, UAD approaches can potentially detect and
localise any type of lesions that deviate from the normal patterns. One
significant challenge faced by UAD methods is how to learn effective
low-dimensional image representations to detect and localise subtle
abnormalities, generally consisting of small lesions. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised representation learning method,
called Constrained Contrastive Distribution learning for anomaly detection
(CCD), which learns fine-grained feature representations by simultaneously
predicting the distribution of augmented data and image contexts using
contrastive learning with pretext constraints. The learned representations can
be leveraged to train more anomaly-sensitive detection models. Extensive
experiment results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
UAD approaches on three different colonoscopy and fundus screening datasets.

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning solves pretext prediction tasks that do not require
annotations to learn feature representations. For vision tasks, pretext tasks
such as predicting rotation, solving jigsaw are solely created from the input
data. Yet, predicting this known information helps in learning representations
useful for downstream tasks. However, recent works have shown that wider and
deeper models benefit more from self-supervised learning than smaller models.
To address the issue of self-supervised pre-training of smaller models, we
propose Distill-on-the-Go (DoGo), a self-supervised learning paradigm using
single-stage online knowledge distillation to improve the representation
quality of the smaller models. We employ deep mutual learning strategy in which
two models collaboratively learn from each other to improve one another.
Specifically, each model is trained using self-supervised learning along with
distillation that aligns each model&#x27;s softmax probabilities of similarity
scores with that of the peer model. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets, learning objectives, and architectures to
demonstrate the potential of our proposed method. Our results show significant
performance gain in the presence of noisy and limited labels and generalization
to out-of-distribution data.</span>

rotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. This is
often attributed to biases in the training dataset, and the lack of 2D
shift-invariance due to not respecting the sampling theorem. In this paper, we
challenge this hypothesis by training and testing on unbiased datasets, and
showing that networks are brittle to both small 3D perspective changes and
lighting variations which cannot be explained by dataset bias or lack of
shift-invariance. To find these in-distribution errors, we introduce an
evolution strategies (ES) based approach, which we call CMA-Search. Despite
training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera
and light variations, in over 71% cases CMA-Search can find camera parameters
in the vicinity of a correctly classified image which lead to in-distribution
misclassifications with &lt; 3.6% change in parameters. With lighting changes,
CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 33% cases with &lt; 11.6% change in
parameters. Finally, we extend this method to find misclassifications in the

                                        <span>With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and
their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are &quot;data hungry&quot; and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our model eliminates the requirement
for class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling
strategy and the use of convolutions. We show that compared to CNNs, our
compact transformers have fewer parameters and MACs, while obtaining similar
accuracies. Our method is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as
little as 0.28M parameters and achieve reasonable results. It can reach an
accuracy of 95.29 % when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is comparable
with modern CNN based approaches, and a significant improvement over previous
Transformer based models. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those equipped with basic computing
resources and/or dealing with important small datasets. Our method works on
larger datasets, such as ImageNet (80.28% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT),
and NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available

                                        <span>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably the most popular
meta-learning algorithm nowadays, given its flexibility to incorporate various
model architectures and to be applied to different problems. Nevertheless, its
performance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms
dedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how
to train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that a large
number of gradient steps are needed for the inner loop update, which
contradicts the common usage of MAML for few-shot classification. Second, we
find that MAML is sensitive to the permutation of class assignments in
meta-testing: for a few-shot task of $N$ classes, there are exponentially many
ways to assign the learned initialization of the $N$-way classifier to the $N$
classes, leading to an unavoidably huge variance. Third, we investigate several
ways for permutation invariance and find that learning a shared classifier
initialization for all the classes performs the best. On benchmark datasets
such as MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name
UNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms, while keeping the simplicity of MAML without adding any extra
sub-networks.</span>

of action recognition task. In this paper, we propose a new two-stream action
recognition network, termed as MENet, consisting of a Motion Enhancement (ME)
module and a Video-level Aggregation (VLA) module to achieve long-short
temporal modeling. Specifically, motion representations have been proved
effective in capturing short-term and high-frequency action. However, current
motion representations are calculated from adjacent frames, which may have poor
interpretation and bring useless information (noisy or blank). Thus, for
short-term motions, we design an efficient ME module to enhance the short-term
motions by mingling the motion saliency among neighboring segments. As for
long-term aggregations, VLA is adopted at the top of the appearance branch to
integrate the long-term dependencies across all segments. The two components of
MENet are complementary in temporal modeling. Extensive experiments are
conducted on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks, which verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed MENet.</span>

localization of the eyes from a periocular Near-Infra-Red iris image under
alcohol consumption. The purpose of the system is to measure the fitness for
duty. Fitness systems allow us to determine whether a person is physically or
psychologically able to perform their tasks. Our framework is based on an
object detector trained from scratch to detect both eyes from a single image.
Then, two efficient networks were used for semantic segmentation; a Criss-Cross
attention network and DenseNet10, with only 122,514 and 210,732 parameters,
respectively. These networks can find the pupil, iris, and sclera. In the end,
the binary output eye mask is used for pupil and iris diameter estimation with
high precision. Five state-of-the-art algorithms were used for this purpose. A
mixed proposal reached the best results. A second contribution is establishing
an alcohol behavior curve to detect the alcohol presence utilizing a stream of
images captured from an iris instance. Also, a manually labeled database with

or predict embedding vectors first then cluster pixels into individual
instances. In this paper, we view the task of instance segmentation from a
completely new perspective by introducing the notion of &quot;instance categories&quot;,
which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the
instance&#x27;s location. With this notion, we propose segmenting objects by
locations (SOLO), a simple, direct, and fast framework for instance
segmentation with strong performance. We derive a few SOLO variants (e.g.,
Vanilla SOLO, Decoupled SOLO, Dynamic SOLO) following the basic principle. Our
method directly maps a raw input image to the desired object categories and
instance masks, eliminating the need for the grouping post-processing or the
bounding box detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for
instance segmentation in terms of both speed and accuracy, while being
considerably simpler than the existing methods. Besides instance segmentation,
our method yields state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask
byproduct) and panoptic segmentation. We further demonstrate the flexibility
and high-quality segmentation of SOLO by extending it to perform one-stage
instance-level image matting. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet</span>

                                        <span>Cell detection in histopathology images is of great value in clinical
practice. \textit{Convolutional neural networks} (CNNs) have been applied to
cell detection to improve the detection accuracy, where cell annotations are
required for network training. However, due to the variety and large number of
cells, complete annotations that include every cell of interest in the training
images can be challenging. Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved,
where positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their
reliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest,
that are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a
lack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply
treat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during
network training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this
work, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the
training of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem.
Specifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take
into account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative
samples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples
of which the labels are unknown. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments
were performed on a publicly available dataset for mitosis detection in breast
cancer cells, and the experimental results show that our method improves the
performance of cell detection given incomplete annotations for training.</span>

However, most of the existing research related to shape completion has been
focused on completing shapes by learning a one-to-one mapping which limits the

a key role in tumor evolution, and yet remains an understudied topic in
computational pathology. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is among the
first to hybrid local and global graph methods to profile orchestration and
interaction of cellular components. To address the challenge in hematolymphoid
cancers where the cell classes in TME are unclear, we first implemented cell
level unsupervised learning and identified two new cell subtypes. Local cell
graphs or supercells were built for each image by considering the individual
cell&#x27;s geospatial location and classes. Then, we applied supercell level
clustering and identified two new cell communities. In the end, we built global
graphs to abstract spatial interaction patterns and extract features for
disease diagnosis. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on H\&amp;E slides of 60
hematolymphoid neoplasm patients and further compared it with three cell level
graph-based algorithms, including the global cell graph, cluster cell graph,
and FLocK. The proposed algorithm achieves a mean diagnosis accuracy of 0.703
with the repeated 5-fold cross-validation scheme. In conclusion, our algorithm
shows superior performance over the existing methods and can be potentially
applied to other cancer types.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-modal imaging is a key healthcare technology in the diagnosis and
management of disease, but it is often underutilized due to costs associated
with multiple separate scans. This limitation yields the need for synthesis of
unacquired modalities from the subset of available modalities. In recent years,
generative adversarial network (GAN) models with superior depiction of
structural details have been established as state-of-the-art in numerous
medical image synthesis tasks. However, GANs are characteristically based on
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones that perform local processing with
compact filters. This inductive bias, in turn, compromises learning of
long-range spatial dependencies. While attention maps incorporated in GANs can
multiplicatively modulate CNN features to emphasize critical image regions,
their capture of global context is mostly implicit. Here, we propose a novel
generative adversarial approach for medical image synthesis, ResViT, to combine
local precision of convolution operators with contextual sensitivity of vision
transformers. Based on an encoder-decoder architecture, ResViT employs a
central bottleneck comprising novel aggregated residual transformer (ART)
blocks that synergistically combine convolutional and transformer modules.
Comprehensive demonstrations are performed for synthesizing missing sequences
in multi-contrast MRI and CT images from MRI. Our results indicate the
superiority of ResViT against competing methods in terms of qualitative
observations and quantitative metrics.</span>

powerful feature learning ability of convolution layers. Specifically, the
standard convolution traverses the input images/features using a sliding window
scheme to extract features. However, not all the windows contribute equally to
the prediction results of CNNs. In practice, the convolutional operation on
some of the windows (e.g., smooth windows that contain very similar pixels) can
be very redundant and may introduce noises into the computation. Such
redundancy may not only deteriorate the performance but also incur the
unnecessary computational cost. Thus, it is important to reduce the
computational redundancy of convolution to improve the performance. To this
end, we propose a Content-aware Convolution (CAC) that automatically detects
the smooth windows and applies a 1x1 convolutional kernel to replace the
original large kernel. In this sense, we are able to effectively avoid the
redundant computation on similar pixels. By replacing the standard convolution
in CNNs with our CAC, the resultant models yield significantly better
performance and lower computational cost than the baseline models with the
standard convolution. More critically, we are able to dynamically allocate
suitable computation resources according to the data smoothness of different
images, making it possible for content-aware computation. Extensive experiments
on various computer vision tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over
existing methods.</span>

sequence, is a central component in multi-object tracking (MOT). To train
association modules, e.g., parametric networks, real video data are usually
used. However, annotating person tracks in consecutive video frames is
expensive, and such real data, due to its inflexibility, offer us limited
opportunities to evaluate the system performance w.r.t changing tracking
scenarios. In this paper, we study whether 3D synthetic data can replace
real-world videos for association training. Specifically, we introduce a
large-scale synthetic data engine named MOTX, where the motion characteristics
of cameras and objects are manually configured to be similar to those in
real-world datasets. We show that compared with real data, association
knowledge obtained from synthetic data can achieve very similar performance on
real-world test sets without domain adaption techniques. Our intriguing
observation is credited to two factors. First and foremost, 3D engines can well
simulate motion factors such as camera movement, camera view and object
movement, so that the simulated videos can provide association modules with
effective motion features. Second, experimental results show that the
appearance domain gap hardly harms the learning of association knowledge. In
addition, the strong customization ability of MOTX allows us to quantitatively
assess the impact of motion factors on MOT, which brings new insights to the
community.</span>

Recently, with the rapid advancement of emotional intelligence and the
explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated
to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this survey, we will
comprehensively review the development of AICA in the recent two decades,
especially focusing on the state-of-the-art methods with respect to three main
challenges -- the affective gap, perception subjectivity, and label noise and
absence. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models
that have been widely employed in AICA and description of available datasets
for performing evaluation with quantitative comparison of label noise and
dataset bias. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on
(1) emotion feature extraction, including both handcrafted and deep features,
(2) learning methods on dominant emotion recognition, personalized emotion
prediction, emotion distribution learning, and learning from noisy data or few
labels, and (3) AICA based applications. Finally, we discuss some challenges

                                        <span>Even though deep neural networks succeed on many different tasks including
semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To
counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is
known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the
Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks.
Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such
single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training.
Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of
single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we
address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic
segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the
robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not
increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training
considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of
meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with
multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic
segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Images obtained in real-world low-light conditions are not only low in
brightness, but they also suffer from many other types of degradation, such as
color bias, unknown noise, detail loss and halo artifacts. In this paper, we
propose a very fast deep learning framework called Bringing the Lightness
(denoted as BLNet) that consists of two U-Nets with a series of well-designed
loss functions to tackle all of the above degradations. Based on Retinex
Theory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into
reflectance and illumination and remove noise in the reflectance during the
decomposition phase. We propose a Noise and Color Bias Control module (NCBC
Module) that contains a convolutional neural network and two loss functions
(noise loss and color loss). This module is only used to calculate the loss
functions during the training phase, so our method is very fast during the test
phase. This module can smooth the reflectance to achieve the purpose of noise
removal while preserving details and edge information and controlling color
bias. We propose a network that can be trained to learn the mapping between
low-light and normal-light illumination and enhance the brightness of images
taken in low-light illumination. We train and evaluate the performance of our
proposed model over the real-world Low-Light (LOL) dataset), and we also test
our model over several other frequently used datasets (LIME, DICM and MEF
datasets). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach
achieves a promising effect with good rubustness and generalization and
outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and
quantitatively. Our method achieves high speed because we use loss functions
instead of introducing additional denoisers for noise removal and color
correction. The code and model are available at

                                        <span>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for
object detection in overhead (e.g., satellite) imagery. One ongoing challenge
however is the acquisition of training data, due to high costs of obtaining
satellite imagery and annotating objects in it. In this work we present a
simple approach - termed Synthetic object IMPLantation (SIMPL) - to easily and
rapidly generate large quantities of synthetic overhead training data for
custom target objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using SIMPL
synthetic imagery for training DNNs in zero-shot scenarios where no real
imagery is available; and few-shot learning scenarios, where limited real-world
imagery is available. We also conduct experiments to study the sensitivity of
SIMPL&#x27;s effectiveness to some key design parameters, providing users for
insights when designing synthetic imagery for custom objects. We release a
software implementation of our SIMPL approach so that others can build upon it,
or use it for their own custom problems.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers provide promising accuracy and have become popular and used in
various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision.
However, due to their massive number of model parameters, memory and
computation requirements, they are not suitable for resource-constrained
low-power devices. Even with high-performance and specialized devices, the
memory bandwidth can become a performance-limiting bottleneck. In this paper,
we present a performance analysis of state-of-the-art vision transformers on
several devices. We propose to reduce the overall memory footprint and memory
transfers by clustering the model parameters. We show that by using only 64
clusters to represent model parameters, it is possible to reduce the data
transfer from the main memory by more than 4x, achieve up to 22% speedup and
39% energy savings on mobile devices with less than 0.1% accuracy loss.</span>

the mesh as basic processing units and represent a 3D mesh as a graph where

we introduce a 1-ring face neighbourhood structure to derive novel
multi-dimensional spatial and structure features to represent the graph nodes.
Based on this new graph representation, we then design a densely connected
graph convolutional block which aggregates local and regional features as the
key construction component to build effective and efficient practical GCN
models for 3D object classification and segmentation. We will present
experimental results to show that our new technique outperforms state of the

on out-of-distribution data, accuracies on in- versus out-of-distribution data
are widely observed to follow a single linear trend when evaluated across a
testbed of models. Models that are more accurate on the out-of-distribution
data relative to this baseline exhibit &quot;effective robustness&quot; and are
exceedingly rare. Identifying such models, and understanding their properties,
is key to improving out-of-distribution performance. We conduct a thorough
empirical investigation of effective robustness during fine-tuning and
surprisingly find that models pre-trained on larger datasets exhibit effective
robustness during training that vanishes at convergence. We study how
properties of the data influence effective robustness, and we show that it
increases with the larger size, more diversity, and higher example difficulty
of the dataset. We also find that models that display effective robustness are
able to correctly classify 10% of the examples that no other current testbed
model gets correct. Finally, we discuss several strategies for scaling
effective robustness to the high-accuracy regime to improve the
out-of-distribution accuracy of state-of-the-art models.</span>

e.g., Credential Authentication Technology (CAT), used by Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), which is a non-trivial security concern. To
overcome the risks incurred due to morphed presentations, we propose a
wavelet-based morph detection methodology which adopts an end-to-end trainable
soft attention mechanism . Our attention-based deep neural network (DNN)
focuses on the salient Regions of Interest (ROI) which have the most spatial
support for morph detector decision function, i.e, morph class binary softmax
output. A retrospective of morph synthesizing procedure aids us to speculate
the ROI as regions around facial landmarks , particularly for the case of
landmark-based morphing techniques. Moreover, our attention-based DNN is
adapted to the wavelet space, where inputs of the network are coarse-to-fine
spectral representations, 48 stacked wavelet sub-bands to be exact. We evaluate
performance of the proposed framework using three datasets, VISAPP17, LMA, and
MorGAN. In addition, as attention maps can be a robust indicator whether a
probe image under investigation is genuine or counterfeit, we analyze the
estimated attention maps for both a bona fide image and its corresponding
morphed image. Finally, we present an ablation study on the efficacy of
utilizing attention mechanism for the sake of morph detection.</span>

diagnosis and can provide invaluable guidance for the treatment of cardiac
diseases. Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been successful for its efficacy in guiding the clinical diagnosis
and treatment reliably. For LGE CMR, many methods have demonstrated success in
accurately segmenting scarring regions. Co-registration with other
non-contrast-agent (non-CA) modalities, balanced steady-state free precession
(bSSFP) and cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for example, can further
enhance the efficacy of automated segmentation of cardiac anatomies. Many
conventional methods have been proposed to provide automated or semi-automated
segmentation of scars. With the development of deep learning in recent years,
we can also see more advanced methods that are more efficient in providing more
accurate segmentations. This paper conducts a state-of-the-art review of
conventional and current state-of-the-art approaches utilising different
modalities for accurate cardiac fibrosis and scar segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>The volume of scientific publications in organizational research becomes
exceedingly overwhelming for human researchers who seek to timely extract and
review knowledge. This paper introduces natural language processing (NLP)
models to accelerate the discovery, extraction, and organization of theoretical
developments (i.e., hypotheses) from social science publications. We illustrate
and evaluate NLP models in the context of a systematic review of stakeholder
value constructs and hypotheses. Specifically, we develop NLP models to
automatically 1) detect sentences in scholarly documents as hypotheses or not
(Hypothesis Detection), 2) deconstruct the hypotheses into nodes (constructs)
and links (causal/associative relationships) (Relationship Deconstruction ),
and 3) classify the features of links in terms causality (versus association)
and direction (positive, negative, versus nonlinear) (Feature Classification).
Our models have reported high performance metrics for all three tasks. While
our models are built in Python, we have made the pre-trained models fully
accessible for non-programmers. We have provided instructions on installing and
using our pre-trained models via an R Shiny app graphic user interface (GUI).
Finally, we suggest the next paths to extend our methodology for
computer-assisted knowledge synthesis.</span>

GAN-based techniques are shown to be promising for spatio-temporal-based
applications such as trajectory prediction, events generation and time-series
data imputation. While several reviews for GANs in computer vision have been
presented, no one has considered addressing the practical applications and
challenges relevant to spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we have conducted a

data. We summarise the application of popular GAN architectures for
spatio-temporal data and the common practices for evaluating the performance of
spatio-temporal applications with GANs. Finally, we point out future research

downstream tasks such as song search and music summarization. Different from
the existing tasks such as music summarization or lyrics summarization relying
on single-modal information, this paper models chorus recognition as a
multi-modal one by utilizing both the lyrics and the tune information of songs.
We propose a multi-modal Chorus Recognition model that considers diverse
features. Besides, we also create and publish the first Chorus Recognition
dataset containing 627 songs for public use. Our empirical study performed on
the dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms several baselines in
chorus recognition. In addition, our approach also helps to improve the
accuracy of its downstream task - song search by more than 10.6%.</span>

create a fair and exciting experience, these games use rating systems to match
players with similar skills. While there has been an increasing amount of
research on improving the performance of these systems, less attention has been
paid to how their performance is evaluated. In this paper, we explore the
utility of several metrics for evaluating three popular rating systems on a
real-world dataset of over 25,000 team battle royale matches. Our results
suggest considerable differences in their evaluation patterns. Some metrics
were highly impacted by the inclusion of new players. Many could not capture
the real differences between certain groups of players. Among all metrics
studied, normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) demonstrated more
reliable performance and more flexibility. It alleviated most of the challenges
faced by the other metrics while adding the freedom to adjust the focus of the
evaluations on different groups of players.</span>

all tokens are treated equally during training. In this work, we introduce a
Reinforcement Iterative Sequence Editing (RISE) framework that optimizes the

able to pay attention to tokens that are related to conversational
characteristics. To train RISE, we devise an Iterative Reinforce Training (IRT)

those rankers alone. We also perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative

(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into
the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model
arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has
demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation has been broadly studied in this decade.
Recently, the next POI recommendation, a natural extension of POI
recommendation, has attracted much attention. It aims at suggesting the next
POI to a user in spatial and temporal context, which is a practical yet
challenging task in various applications. Existing approaches mainly model the
spatial and temporal information, and memorize historical patterns through
user&#x27;s trajectories for recommendation. However, they suffer from the negative
impact of missing and irregular check-in data, which significantly influences
the model performance. In this paper, we propose an attention-based
sequence-to-sequence generative model, namely POI-Augmentation Seq2Seq
(PA-Seq2Seq), to address the sparsity of training set by making check-in
records to be evenly-spaced. Specifically, the encoder summarises each check-in
sequence and the decoder predicts the possible missing check-ins based on the
encoded information. In order to learn time-aware correlation among user
history, we employ local attention mechanism to help the decoder focus on a
specific range of context information when predicting a certain missing
check-in point. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world
check-in datasets, Gowalla and Brightkite, for performance and effectiveness
evaluation.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic summarization of legal case documents is an important and practical
challenge. Apart from many domain-independent text summarization algorithms
that can be used for this purpose, several algorithms have been developed
specifically for summarizing legal case documents. However, most of the
existing algorithms do not systematically incorporate domain knowledge that
specifies what information should ideally be present in a legal case document
summary. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised summarization
algorithm DELSumm which is designed to systematically incorporate guidelines
from legal experts into an optimization setup. We conduct detailed experiments
over case documents from the Indian Supreme Court. The experiments show that
our proposed unsupervised method outperforms several strong baselines in terms
of ROUGE scores, including both general summarization algorithms and
legal-specific ones. In fact, though our proposed algorithm is unsupervised, it
outperforms several supervised summarization models that are trained over
thousands of document-summary pairs.</span>

                                        <span>Robust recommendation aims at capturing true preference of users from noisy
data, for which there are two lines of methods have been proposed. One is based
on noise injection, and the other is to adopt the generative model Variational
Auto-encoder (VAE). However, the existing works still face two challenges.
First, the noise injection based methods often draw the noise from a fixed
noise distribution given in advance, while in real world, the noise
distributions of different users and items may differ from each other due to
personal behaviors and item usage patterns. Second, the VAE based models are
not expressive enough to capture the true preference since VAE often yields an
embedding space of a single modal, while in real world, user-item interactions
usually exhibit multi-modality on user preference distribution. In this paper,
we propose a novel model called Dual Adversarial Variational Embedding (DAVE)
for robust recommendation, which can provide personalized noise reduction for
different users and items, and capture the multi-modality of the embedding
space, by combining the advantages of VAE and adversarial training between the
introduced auxiliary discriminators and the variational inference networks. The
extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the effectiveness of
DAVE on robust recommendation.</span>

point-of-interest (POI) recommendation recommends users unexplored POIs based
on their recent visiting histories. However, existing work mainly models
check-in data as isolated POI sequences, neglecting the crucial collaborative
signals from cross-sequence check-in information. Furthermore, the sparse
POI-POI transitions restrict the ability of a model to learn effective
sequential patterns for recommendation. In this paper, we propose
Sequence-to-Graph (Seq2Graph) augmentation for each POI sequence, allowing
collaborative signals to be propagated from correlated POIs belonging to other
sequences. We then devise a novel Sequence-to-Graph POI Recommender (SGRec),
which jointly learns POI embeddings and infers a user&#x27;s temporal preferences
from the graph-augmented POI sequence. To overcome the sparsity of POI-level
interactions, we further infuse category-awareness into SGRec with a multi-task
learning scheme that captures the denser category-wise transitions. As such,
SGRec makes full use of the collaborative signals for learning expressive POI
representations, and also comprehensively uncovers multi-level sequential
patterns for user preference modelling. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SGRec against state-of-the-art methods
in next POI recommendation.</span>

without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual

Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the

methods. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of gradient compression methods
and compare their scalability with optimized implementations of synchronous

observe that only in 6 cases out of more than 200, gradient compression methods
provide speedup over optimized synchronous data-parallel training in the

the root causes of this phenomenon, and offer a performance model that can be

many complex stochastic sequential optimization problems. These problems need
to be solved for integrating renewable energies and distributed storage into
future electrical grids. In this work, we introduce Gym-ANM, a framework for
designing reinforcement learning (RL) environments that model ANM tasks in
electricity distribution networks. These environments provide new playgrounds
for RL research in the management of electricity networks that do not require
an extensive knowledge of the underlying dynamics of such systems. Along with
this work, we are releasing an implementation of an introductory
toy-environment, ANM6-Easy, designed to emphasize common challenges in ANM. We
also show that state-of-the-art RL algorithms can already achieve good
performance on ANM6-Easy when compared against a model predictive control (MPC)
approach. Finally, we provide guidelines to create new Gym-ANM environments
differing in terms of (a) the distribution network topology and parameters, (b)
the observation space, (c) the modelling of the stochastic processes present in
the system, and (d) a set of hyperparameters influencing the reward signal.

                                        <span>Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This
has motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language,
in order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential
weaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard
attention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by
constant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,
which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.
In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated
attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the
attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated
transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With
some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a
saturated transformer memory vector is $O(\log n)$, which implies saturated
transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard
to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer&#x27;s
effective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\log n)$.</span>

value-based counterparts. However, the same properties also make them slow to
converge and sample inefficient, as the on-policy requirement precludes data
reuse and the incremental updates couple large iteration complexity into the
sample complexity. These characteristics have been observed in experiments as
well as in theory in the recent work of~\citet{agarwal2020pc}, which provides a
policy optimization method PCPG that can robustly find near optimal polices for
approximately linear Markov decision processes but suffers from an extremely
poor sample complexity compared with value-based techniques.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, COPOE, that overcomes the sample
complexity issue of PCPG while retaining its robustness to model
misspecification. Compared with PCPG, COPOE makes several important algorithmic
enhancements, such as enabling data reuse, and uses more refined analysis
techniques, which we expect to be more broadly applicable to designing new
reinforcement learning algorithms. The result is an improvement in sample
complexity from $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{11})$ for PCPG to
$\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ for PCPG, nearly bridging the gap with
value-based techniques.</span>

formalized by Moshkovitz, Dasgupta, Rashtchian, and Frost (ICML 2020). A
$k$-clustering is said to be explainable if it is given by a decision tree
where each internal node splits data points with a threshold cut in a single
dimension (feature), and each of the $k$ leaves corresponds to a cluster. We
give an algorithm that outputs an explainable clustering that loses at most a
factor of $O(\log^2 k)$ compared to an optimal (not necessarily explainable)
clustering for the $k$-medians objective, and a factor of $O(k \log^2 k)$ for
the $k$-means objective. This improves over the previous best upper bounds of
$O(k)$ and $O(k^2)$, respectively, and nearly matches the previous $\Omega(\log
k)$ lower bound for $k$-medians and our new $\Omega(k)$ lower bound for
$k$-means. The algorithm is remarkably simple. In particular, given an initial
not necessarily explainable clustering in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it is oblivious to
the data points and runs in time $O(dk \log^2 k)$, independent of the number of
data points $n$. Our upper and lower bounds also generalize to objectives given
by higher $\ell_p$-norms.</span>

general framework for robot decision making under uncertainty, but POMDP
planning suffers from high computational complexity, when long-term planning is
required. While temporally-extended macro-actions help to cut down the
effective planning horizon and significantly improve computational efficiency,
how do we acquire good macro-actions? This paper proposes Macro-Action
Generator-Critic (MAGIC), which performs offline learning of macro-actions
optimized for online POMDP planning. Specifically, MAGIC learns a macro-action
generator end-to-end, using an online planner&#x27;s performance as the feedback.
During online planning, the generator generates on the fly situation-aware
macro-actions conditioned on the robot&#x27;s belief and the environment context. We
evaluated MAGIC on several long-horizon planning tasks both in simulation and
on a real robot. The experimental results show that the learned macro-actions
offer significant benefits in online planning performance, compared with
primitive actions and handcrafted macro-actions.</span>

stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and of full-batch gradient descent (GD) in
the fundamental stochastic convex optimization model. While for SGD it is
well-known that $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations suffice for obtaining a solution
with $\epsilon$ excess expected risk, we show that with the same number of
steps GD may overfit and emit a solution with $\Omega(1)$ generalization error.
Moreover, we show that in fact $\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations are necessary
for GD to match the generalization performance of SGD, which is also tight due
to recent work by Bassily et al. (2020). We further discuss how regularizing
the empirical risk minimized by GD essentially does not change the above

the learning algorithm in generalization.</span>

                                        <span>Current black-box variational inference (BBVI) methods require the user to
make numerous design choices -- such as the selection of variational objective
and approximating family -- yet there is little principled guidance on how to
do so. We develop a conceptual framework and set of experimental tools to
understand the effects of these choices, which we leverage to propose best
practices for maximizing posterior approximation accuracy. Our approach is
based on studying the pre-asymptotic tail behavior of the density ratios
between the joint distribution and the variational approximation, then
exploiting insights and tools from the importance sampling literature. Our
framework and supporting experiments help to distinguish between the behavior
of BBVI methods for approximating low-dimensional versus
moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors. In the latter case, we show that
mass-covering variational objectives are difficult to optimize and do not
improve accuracy, but flexible variational families can improve accuracy and
the effectiveness of importance sampling -- at the cost of additional
optimization challenges. Therefore, for moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors
we recommend using the (mode-seeking) exclusive KL divergence since it is the
easiest to optimize, and improving the variational family or using model
parameter transformations to make the posterior and optimal variational
approximation more similar. On the other hand, in low-dimensional settings, we
show that heavy-tailed variational families and mass-covering divergences are
effective and can increase the chances that the approximation can be improved
by importance sampling.</span>

optimization rooted in model design, architecture, and system capabilities.
From a system standpoint, communication has become a major bottleneck,
especially on commodity systems with standard TCP interconnects that offer
limited network bandwidth. Communication compression is an important technique
to reduce training time on such systems. One of the most effective methods is
error-compensated compression, which offers robust convergence speed even under
1-bit compression. However, state-of-the-art error compensation techniques only
work with basic optimizers like SGD and momentum SGD, which are linearly
dependent on the gradients. They do not work with non-linear gradient-based
optimizers like Adam, which offer state-of-the-art convergence efficiency and
accuracy for models like BERT. In this paper, we propose 1-bit Adam that
reduces the communication volume by up to $5\times$, offers much better
scalability, and provides the same convergence speed as uncompressed Adam. Our
key finding is that Adam&#x27;s variance (non-linear term) becomes stable (after a
warmup phase) and can be used as a fixed precondition for the rest of the
training (compression phase). Experiments on up to 256 GPUs show that 1-bit
Adam enables up to $3.3\times$ higher throughput for BERT-Large pre-training
and up to $2.9\times$ higher throughput for SQuAD fine-tuning. In addition, we
provide theoretical analysis for our proposed work.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) starts to be widely used to enhance the performance of
multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receivers. However, it is
still unclear if such methods are truly competitive with respect to
conventional methods in realistic scenarios and under practical constraints. In
addition to enabling accurate signal reconstruction on realistic channel
models, MU-MIMO receive algorithms must allow for easy adaptation to a varying
number of users without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing work,
we propose an ML-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver that builds on top of a conventional
linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) architecture. It preserves the
interpretability and scalability of the LMMSE receiver, while improving its
accuracy in two ways. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to
compute an approximation of the second-order statistics of the channel
estimation error which are required for accurate equalization. Second, a
CNN-based demapper jointly processes a large number of orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols and subcarriers, which allows it
to compute better log likelihood ratios (LLRs) by compensating for channel
aging. The resulting architecture can be used in the up- and downlink and is
trained in an end-to-end manner, removing the need for hard-to-get perfect
channel state information (CSI) during the training phase. Simulation results
demonstrate consistent performance improvements over the baseline which are
especially pronounced in high mobility scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Graph Networks (GNs) enable the fusion of prior knowledge and relational
reasoning with flexible function approximations. In this work, a general
GN-based model is proposed which takes full advantage of the relational
modeling capabilities of GNs and extends these to probabilistic modeling with
Variational Bayes (VB). To that end, we combine complementary pre-existing
approaches on VB for graph data and propose an approach that relies on
graph-structured latent and conditioning variables. It is demonstrated that
Neural Processes can also be viewed through the lens of the proposed model. We
show applications on the problem of structured probability density modeling for
simulated and real wind farm monitoring data, as well as on the meta-learning
of simulated Gaussian Process data. We release the source code, along with the
simulated datasets.</span>

single-step cost along a trajectory. The optimized motions are often
&#x27;unnatural&#x27;, representing, for example, behaviors with sudden accelerations
that waste energy and lack predictability. In this work, we present a novel
paradigm of controlling nonlinear systems via the minimization of the Koopman
spectrum cost: a cost over the Koopman operator of the controlled dynamics.
This induces a broader class of dynamical behaviors that evolve over stable
manifolds such as nonlinear oscillators, closed loops, and smooth movements. We
demonstrate that some dynamics realizations that are not possible with a
cumulative cost are feasible in this paradigm. Moreover, we present a provably
efficient online learning algorithm for our problem that enjoys a sub-linear
regret bound under some structural assumptions.</span>

                                        <span>Computing an AUC as a performance measure to compare the quality of different
machine learning models is one of the final steps of many research projects.
Many of these methods are trained on privacy-sensitive data and there are
several different approaches like $\epsilon$-differential privacy, federated
machine learning and methods based on cryptographic approaches if the datasets
cannot be shared or evaluated jointly at one place. In this setting, it can
also be a problem to compute the global performance measure like an AUC, since
the labels might also contain privacy-sensitive information. There have been
approaches based on $\epsilon$-differential privacy to deal with this problem,
but to the best of our knowledge, no exact privacy preserving solution has been
introduced. In this paper, we propose an MPC-based framework, called \fw{},
with private merging of sorted lists and novel methods for comparing two
secret-shared values, selecting between two secret-shared values, converting
the modulus, and performing division to compute the exact AUC as one could
obtain on the pooled original test samples. With \fw{} computation of the exact
area under precision-recall curve and receiver operating characteristic curve
is even possible when ties between prediction confidence values exist. To show
the applicability of \fw{}, we use it to evaluate a model trained to predict
acute myeloid leukemia therapy response and we also assess its scalability via
experiments on synthetic data. The experiments show that we efficiently compute
exactly the same AUC with both evaluation metrics in a privacy preserving
manner as one can obtain on the pooled test samples in the plaintext domain.
Our solution provides security against semi-honest corruption of at most one of
the servers performing the secure computation.</span>

                                        <span>The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is a combinatorial
optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total score collected
from different visited locations. The application of neural network models to
combinatorial optimization has recently shown promising results in dealing with
similar problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A neural network allows
learning solutions using reinforcement learning or supervised learning,
depending on the available data. After the learning stage, it can be
generalized and quickly fine-tuned to further improve performance and
personalization. The advantages are evident since, for real-world applications,
solution quality, personalization, and execution times are all important
factors that should be taken into account.

This study explores the use of Pointer Network models trained using
reinforcement learning to solve the OPTW problem. We propose a modified
architecture that leverages Pointer Networks to better address problems related
with dynamic time-dependent constraints. Among its various applications, the
OPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We train the
Pointer Network with the TTDP problem in mind, by sampling variables that can
change across tourists visiting a particular instance-region: starting
position, starting time, available time, and the scores given to each point of
interest. Once a model-region is trained, it can infer a solution for a
particular tourist using beam search. We based the assessment of our approach
on several existing benchmark OPTW instances. We show that it generalizes
across different tourists that visit each region and that it generally
outperforms the most commonly used heuristic, while computing the solution in
realistic times.</span>

important research objective to understand their behavior in modern
applications involving autoencoders and loop unrolling techniques, among
others. In particular, we focus on networks with nonnegative inputs and
nonnegative network parameters, as often considered in the literature. We show
that such networks can be recognized as monotonic and (weakly) scalable
functions within the framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact
enables us to derive conditions for the existence of a nonempty fixed point set
of the neural networks, and these conditions are weaker than those obtained
recently using arguments in convex analysis, which are typically based on the
assumption of nonexpansivity of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove
that the shape of the fixed point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural
networks is often an interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of
scalable networks. The chief results of this paper are verified in numerical
simulations, where we consider an autoencoder-type network that first
compresses angular power spectra in massive MIMO systems, and, second,
reconstruct the input spectra from the compressed signal.</span>

                                        <span>Variational Inference (VI) is a popular alternative to asymptotically exact
sampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a
reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the
tail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy.
Importance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and
de-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality
of IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally,
the proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely
achievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of
optimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by
constructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward
KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast
convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational
approximation. We empirically demonstrate on real data that our method is
competitive with variational boosting and MCMC.</span>

                                        <span>Current radio frequency (RF) sensors at the Edge lack the computational
resources to support practical, in-situ training for intelligent spectrum
monitoring, and sensor data classification in general. We propose a solution
via Deep Delay Loop Reservoir Computing (DLR), a processing architecture that
supports general machine learning algorithms on compact mobile devices by
leveraging delay-loop reservoir computing in combination with innovative
electrooptical hardware. With both digital and photonic realizations of our
design of the loops, DLR delivers reductions in form factor, hardware
complexity and latency, compared to the State-of-the-Art (SoA). The main impact
of the reservoir is to project the input data into a higher dimensional space
of reservoir state vectors in order to linearly separate the input classes.
Once the classes are well separated, traditionally complex, power-hungry
classification models are no longer needed for the learning process. Yet, even
with simple classifiers based on Ridge regression (RR), the complexity grows at
least quadratically with the input size. Hence, the hardware reduction required
for training on compact devices is in contradiction with the large dimension of
state vectors. DLR employs a RR-based classifier to exceed the SoA accuracy,
while further reducing power consumption by leveraging the architecture of
parallel (split) loops. We present DLR architectures composed of multiple
smaller loops whose state vectors are linearly combined to create a lower
dimensional input into Ridge regression. We demonstrate the advantages of using
DLR for two distinct applications: RF Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) for
IoT authentication, and wireless protocol recognition for IoT situational
awareness.</span>

customer concerns and enhance customer order experience. Because customer
feedback often contains redundant information, a concise summary of the
feedback can be generated to help sellers better understand the issues causing
customer dissatisfaction. Previous state-of-the-art abstractive text
summarization models make two major types of factual errors when producing
summaries from customer feedback, which are wrong entity detection (WED) and
incorrect product-defect description (IPD). In this work, we introduce a set of
methods to enhance the factual consistency of abstractive summarization on
customer feedback. We augment the training data with artificially corrupted
summaries, and use them as counterparts of the target summaries. We add a
contrastive loss term into the training objective so that the model learns to
avoid certain factual errors. Evaluation results show that a large portion of
WED and IPD errors are alleviated for BART and T5. Furthermore, our approaches
do not depend on the structure of the summarization model and thus are
generalizable to any abstractive summarization systems.</span>

                                        <span>This paper studies the decentralized optimization and learning problem where
multiple interconnected agents aim to learn an optimal decision function
defined over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by jointly minimizing a global
objective function, with access to their own locally observed dataset. As a
non-parametric approach, kernel learning faces a major challenge in distributed
implementation: the decision variables of local objective functions are
data-dependent and thus cannot be optimized under the decentralized consensus
framework without any raw data exchange among agents. To circumvent this major
challenge, we leverage the random feature (RF) approximation approach to enable
consensus on the function modeled in the RF space by data-independent
parameters across different agents. We then design an iterative algorithm,
termed DKLA, for fast-convergent implementation via ADMM. Based on DKLA, we
further develop a communication-censored kernel learning (COKE) algorithm that
reduces the communication load of DKLA by preventing an agent from transmitting
at every iteration unless its local updates are deemed informative. Theoretical
results in terms of linear convergence guarantee and generalization performance
analysis of DKLA and COKE are provided. Comprehensive tests on both synthetic
and real datasets are conducted to verify the communication efficiency and
learning effectiveness of COKE.</span>

receiver solution for demodulating OFDM signals that are subject to a high
level of nonlinear distortion. Specifically, a novel deep learning based
convolutional neural network receiver is devised, containing layers in both
time- and frequency domains, allowing to demodulate and decode the transmitted
bits reliably despite the high error vector magnitude (EVM) in the transmit
signal. Extensive set of numerical results is provided, in the context of 5G NR
uplink incorporating also measured terminal power amplifier characteristics.
The obtained results show that the proposed receiver system is able to clearly
outperform classical linear receivers as well as existing ML receiver
approaches, especially when the EVM is high in comparison with modulation
order. The proposed ML receiver can thus facilitate pushing the terminal power
amplifier (PA) systems deeper into saturation, and thereon improve the terminal
power-efficiency, radiated power and network coverage.</span>

                                        <span>The Hessian of a neural network captures parameter interactions through
second-order derivatives of the loss. It is a fundamental object of study,
closely tied to various problems in deep learning, including model design,
optimization, and generalization. Most prior work has been empirical, typically
focusing on low-rank approximations and heuristics that are blind to the
network structure. In contrast, we develop theoretical tools to analyze the
range of the Hessian map, providing us with a precise understanding of its rank
deficiency as well as the structural reasons behind it. This yields exact
formulas and tight upper bounds for the Hessian rank of deep linear networks,
allowing for an elegant interpretation in terms of rank deficiency. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our bounds remain faithful as an estimate of the numerical
Hessian rank, for a larger class of models such as rectified and hyperbolic
tangent networks. Further, we also investigate the implications of model
architecture (e.g.~width, depth, bias) on the rank deficiency. Overall, our
work provides novel insights into the source and extent of redundancy in
overparameterized networks.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we revisit the theoretical properties of Hamiltonian stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) for Bayesian posterior sampling, and we study the
two types of errors that arise from numerical SDE simulation: the
discretization error and the error due to noisy gradient estimates in the
context of data subsampling. We consider overlooked results describing the
ergodic convergence rates of numerical integration schemes, and we produce a
novel analysis for the effect of mini-batches through the lens of differential
operator splitting. In our analysis, the stochastic component of the proposed
Hamiltonian SDE is decoupled from the gradient noise, for which we make no
normality assumptions. This allows us to derive interesting connections among
different sampling schemes, including the original Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) algorithm, and explain their performance. We show that for a careful
selection of numerical integrators, both errors vanish at a rate
$\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$, where $\eta$ is the integrator step size. Our
theoretical results are supported by an empirical study on a variety of
regression and classification tasks for Bayesian neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>Despite a series of recent successes in reinforcement learning (RL), many RL
algorithms remain sensitive to hyperparameters. As such, there has recently
been interest in the field of AutoRL, which seeks to automate design decisions
to create more general algorithms. Recent work suggests that population based
approaches may be effective AutoRL algorithms, by learning hyperparameter
schedules on the fly. In particular, the PB2 algorithm is able to achieve
strong performance in RL tasks by formulating online hyperparameter
optimization as time varying GP-bandit problem, while also providing
theoretical guarantees. However, PB2 is only designed to work for continuous
hyperparameters, which severely limits its utility in practice. In this paper
we introduce a new (provably) efficient hierarchical approach for optimizing
both continuous and categorical variables, using a new time-varying bandit
algorithm specifically designed for the population based training regime. We
evaluate our approach on the challenging Procgen benchmark, where we show that
explicitly modelling dependence between data augmentation and other
hyperparameters improves generalization.</span>

various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision.
However, due to their massive number of model parameters, memory and
computation requirements, they are not suitable for resource-constrained
low-power devices. Even with high-performance and specialized devices, the
memory bandwidth can become a performance-limiting bottleneck. In this paper,
we present a performance analysis of state-of-the-art vision transformers on
several devices. We propose to reduce the overall memory footprint and memory
transfers by clustering the model parameters. We show that by using only 64
clusters to represent model parameters, it is possible to reduce the data
transfer from the main memory by more than 4x, achieve up to 22% speedup and
39% energy savings on mobile devices with less than 0.1% accuracy loss.</span>

framework covers several popular models in recent network analysis literature,

our model enjoys decent generality, its maximum likelihood parameter estimation

a novel algorithm using projected gradient descent on Grassmannians. We also
develop original theoretical guarantees for our algorithm. First, we show its
linear convergence under mild conditions. Second, we establish finite-sample
statistical error rates of latent position estimation, determined by the signal

communication connectivity under unpredictable external disruptions (UEDs).
Firstly, to cope with the one-off UEDs, we propose a graph convolutional neural
network (GCN) and find the recovery topology of the USNET in an on-line manner.
Secondly, to cope with general UEDs, we develop a GCN based trajectory planning
algorithm that can make UAVs rebuild the communication connectivity during the
self-healing process. We also design a meta learning scheme to facilitate the
on-line executions of the GCN. Numerical results show that the proposed
algorithms can rebuild the communication connectivity of the USNET more quickly
than the existing algorithms under both one-off UEDs and general UEDs. The
simulation results also show that the meta learning scheme can not only enhance

fundamental research problem in natural language processing. Explaining human
conversations poses a great challenge as it requires contextual understanding,
planning, inference, and several aspects of reasoning including causal,
temporal, and commonsense reasoning. In this work, we introduce CIDER -- a
manually curated dataset that contains dyadic dialogue explanations in the form
of implicit and explicit knowledge triplets inferred using contextual
commonsense inference. Extracting such rich explanations from conversations can
be conducive to improving several downstream applications. The annotated
triplets are categorized by the type of commonsense knowledge present (e.g.,
causal, conditional, temporal). We set up three different tasks conditioned on
the annotated dataset: Dialogue-level Natural Language Inference, Span
Extraction, and Multi-choice Span Selection. Baseline results obtained with
transformer-based models reveal that the tasks are difficult, paving the way
for promising future research. The dataset and the baseline implementations are

are trained by maximizing an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). To obtain tighter
ELBO and hence better variational approximations, it has been proposed to use
importance sampling to get a lower variance estimate of the evidence. However,
importance sampling is known to perform poorly in high dimensions. While it has
been suggested many times in the literature to use more sophisticated
algorithms such as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and its Sequential
Importance Sampling (SIS) extensions, the potential benefits brought by these
advanced techniques have never been realized for VAE: the AIS estimate cannot
be easily differentiated, while SIS requires the specification of carefully
chosen backward Markov kernels. In this paper, we address both issues and
demonstrate the performance of the resulting Monte Carlo VAEs on a variety of
applications.</span>

                                        <span>The quantification of wave loading on offshore structures and components is a
crucial element in the assessment of their useful remaining life. In many
applications the well-known Morison&#x27;s equation is employed to estimate the
forcing from waves with assumed particle velocities and accelerations. This
paper develops a grey-box modelling approach to improve the predictions of the
force on structural members. A grey-box model intends to exploit the enhanced
predictive capabilities of data-based modelling whilst retaining physical
insight into the behaviour of the system; in the context of the work carried
out here, this can be considered as physics-informed machine learning. There
are a number of possible approaches to establish a grey-box model. This paper
demonstrates two means of combining physics (white box) and data-based (black
box) components; one where the model is a simple summation of the two
components, the second where the white-box prediction is fed into the black box
as an additional input. Here Morison&#x27;s equation is used as the physics-based
component in combination with a data-based Gaussian process NARX - a dynamic
variant of the more well-known Gaussian process regression. Two key challenges
with employing the GP-NARX formulation that are addressed here are the
selection of appropriate lag terms and the proper treatment of uncertainty
propagation within the dynamic GP. The best performing grey-box model, the
residual modelling GP-NARX, was able to achieve a 29.13\% and 5.48\% relative
reduction in NMSE over Morison&#x27;s Equation and a black-box GP-NARX respectively,
alongside significant benefits in extrapolative capabilities of the model, in
circumstances of low dataset coverage.</span>

observed that feature-learning discriminators outperform fixed-kernel
discriminators in terms of the sample quality of the models. We provide
separation results between probability metrics with fixed-kernel and
feature-learning discriminators using the function classes $\mathcal{F}_2$ and
$\mathcal{F}_1$ respectively, which were developed to study overparametrized
two-layer neural networks. In particular, we construct pairs of distributions
over hyper-spheres that can not be discriminated by fixed kernel
$(\mathcal{F}_2)$ integral probability metric (IPM) and Stein discrepancy (SD)
in high dimensions, but that can be discriminated by their feature learning
($\mathcal{F}_1$) counterparts. To further study the separation we provide
links between the $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ IPMs with sliced
Wasserstein distances. Our work suggests that fixed-kernel discriminators
perform worse than their feature learning counterparts because their
corresponding metrics are weaker.</span>

in device wake-up and user interaction on smart devices. However, it is
challenging to minimize errors while operating efficiently in devices with
limited resources such as mobile phones. We present a broadcasted residual
learning method to achieve high accuracy with small model size and
computational load. Our method configures most of the residual functions as 1D
temporal convolution while still allows 2D convolution together using a
broadcasted-residual connection that expands temporal output to
frequency-temporal dimension. This residual mapping enables the network to
effectively represent useful audio features with much less computation than
conventional convolutional neural networks. We also propose a novel network
architecture, Broadcasting-residual network (BC-ResNet), based on broadcasted
residual learning and describe how to scale up the model according to the
target device&#x27;s resources. BC-ResNets achieve state-of-the-art 98.0% and 98.7%
top-1 accuracy on Google speech command datasets v1 and v2, respectively, and
consistently outperform previous approaches, using fewer computations and
parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Robot manipulation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a
challenging problem due to the variety of shapes, materials, arrangements and
lighting conditions. Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust
perception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across
various lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we
propose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.
The underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural
network using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation
masks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as
output. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo
sub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection,
unknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and
significantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor.
By inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can
be used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and
hard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments.
In unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D
network and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects.
However, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent)
objects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust
manipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown
environments.</span>

docking. We share a dataset consisting of 200 million 3D complex structures and
2D structure scores across a consistent set of 13 million &quot;in-stock&quot; molecules
over 15 receptors, or binding sites, across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Our work
shows surrogate docking models have six orders of magnitude more throughput
than standard docking protocols on the same supercomputer node types. We
demonstrate the power of high-speed surrogate models by running each target
against 1 billion molecules in under a day (50k predictions per GPU seconds).
We showcase a workflow for docking utilizing surrogate ML models as a
pre-filter. Our workflow is ten times faster at screening a library of
compounds than the standard technique, with an error rate less than 0.01\% of
detecting the underlying best scoring 0.1\% of compounds. Our analysis of the
speedup explains that to screen more molecules under a docking paradigm,
another order of magnitude speedup must come from model accuracy rather than
computing speed (which, if increased, will not anymore alter our throughput to
screen molecules). We believe this is strong evidence for the community to
begin focusing on improving the accuracy of surrogate models to improve the
ability to screen massive compound libraries 100x or even 1000x faster than
current techniques.</span>

leveraging prior experience, which can be either self-generated or acquired
from other entities. Action advising is a framework that provides a flexible
way to transfer such knowledge in the form of actions between teacher-student
peers. However, due to the realistic concerns, the number of these interactions
is limited with a budget; therefore, it is crucial to perform these in the most
appropriate moments. There have been several promising studies recently that
address this problem setting especially from the student&#x27;s perspective. Despite
their success, they have some shortcomings when it comes to the practical
applicability and integrity as an overall solution to the learning from advice
challenge. In this paper, we extend the idea of advice reusing via teacher
imitation to construct a unified approach that addresses both advice collection
and advice utilisation problems. We also propose a method to automatically tune
the relevant hyperparameters of these components on-the-fly to make it able to
adapt to any task with minimal human intervention. The experiments we performed
in 5 different Atari games verify that our algorithm either surpasses or
performs on-par with its top competitors while being far simpler to be
employed. Furthermore, its individual components are also found to be providing

                                        <span>Machine Learning (ML) has recently been demonstrated to rival expert-level
human accuracy in prediction and detection tasks in a variety of domains,
including medicine. Despite these impressive findings, however, a key barrier
to the full realization of ML&#x27;s potential in medical prognoses is technology
acceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress
in improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer
from limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a
system fails, but do poorly at explaining when and why a model&#x27;s prediction is
correct. We posit that the acceptability of ML predictions in expert domains is
limited by two key factors: the machine&#x27;s horizon of prediction that extends
beyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to
incorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML
architecture, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to enhance human
understanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human
cognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a
distribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this
approach may significantly improve human-machine collaboration in prediction
tasks in expert domains such as medical prognoses. We propose a model and
demonstrate, by expanding a concrete example from the literature, how our model
advances the vision of future hybrid Human-AI systems.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and
their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are &quot;data hungry&quot; and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our model eliminates the requirement
for class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling
strategy and the use of convolutions. We show that compared to CNNs, our
compact transformers have fewer parameters and MACs, while obtaining similar
accuracies. Our method is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as
little as 0.28M parameters and achieve reasonable results. It can reach an
accuracy of 95.29 % when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is comparable
with modern CNN based approaches, and a significant improvement over previous
Transformer based models. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those equipped with basic computing
resources and/or dealing with important small datasets. Our method works on
larger datasets, such as ImageNet (80.28% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT),
and NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available
at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers.</span>

                                        <span>Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to
predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source
task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been
widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major
challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the
cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this
problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of
transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.
In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score
that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in
OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the
joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal
transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and
label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative
conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,
respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability
metrics on average.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a general framework for approximating regular conditional
distributions (RCDs). Our approximations of these RCDs are implemented by a new
class of geometric deep learning models with inputs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and
outputs in the Wasserstein-$1$ space $\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D)$. We find
that the models built using our framework can approximate any continuous
functions from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D)$ uniformly on
compacts, and quantitative rates are obtained. We identify two methods for
avoiding the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;; i.e.: the number of parameters
determining the approximating neural network depends only polynomially on the
involved dimension and the approximation error. The first solution describes
functions in $C(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D))$ which can be
efficiently approximated on any compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Conversely,
the second approach describes sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, on which any function in
$C(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D))$ can be efficiently approximated.
Our framework is used to obtain an affirmative answer to the open conjecture of
Bishop (1994); namely: mixture density networks are universal regular
conditional distributions. The predictive performance of the proposed models is
evaluated against comparable learning models on various probabilistic
predictions tasks in the context of ELMs, model uncertainty, and
heteroscedastic regression. All the results are obtained for more general input
and output spaces and thus apply to geometric deep learning contexts.</span>

problems in a Bayesian framework. Bayesian posteriors afford a principled
mechanism to incorporate data and prior knowledge into stochastic optimization
problems. However, the computation of Bayesian posteriors is typically an
intractable problem, and has spawned a large literature on approximate Bayesian
computation. Here, in the context of chance-constrained optimization, we focus
on the question of statistical consistency (in an appropriate sense) of the
optimal value, computed using an approximate posterior distribution. To this
end, we rigorously prove a frequentist consistency result demonstrating the
convergence of the optimal value to the optimal value of a fixed, parameterized
constrained optimization problem. We augment this by also establishing a
probabilistic rate of convergence of the optimal value. We also prove the
convex feasibility of the approximate Bayesian stochastic optimization problem.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach on an optimal staffing
problem for an M/M/c queueing model.</span>

                                        <span>Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine
learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve
the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning
rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective
adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer
problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic
momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. At the
same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by
using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in
estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated
BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still
achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ without large
batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm
(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our
methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of
adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum
and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence
analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel
optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel
optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.</span>

                                        <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a relatively large number of labeled
nodes and a reliable/uncorrupted graph connectivity structure in order to
obtain good performance on the semi-supervised node classification task. The
performance of GNNs can degrade significantly as the number of labeled nodes
decreases or the graph connectivity structure is corrupted by adversarial
attacks or due to noises in data measurement /collection. Therefore, it is
important to develop GNN models that are able to achieve good performance when
there is limited supervision knowledge -- a few labeled nodes and noisy graph
structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual GNN learning framework to
address this challenge task. The proposed framework has two GNN based node
prediction modules. The primary module uses the input graph structure to induce
regular node embeddings and predictions with a regular GNN baseline, while the
auxiliary module constructs a new graph structure through fine-grained spectral
clusterings and learns new node embeddings and predictions. By integrating the
two modules in a dual GNN learning framework, we perform joint learning in an
end-to-end fashion. This general framework can be applied on many GNN baseline
models. The experimental results validate that the proposed dual GNN framework
can greatly outperform the GNN baseline methods when the labeled nodes are
scarce and the graph connectivity structure is noisy.</span>

without the need for centralizing training data, thereby maintaining data
privacy. Addressing the ability to handle data heterogeneity (non-identical and
independent distribution or non-IID) is a key enabler for the wider deployment

                                        <span>Existing computer vision research in categorization struggles with
fine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class
variances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by
locating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the
complete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its
strong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image
classification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without
requiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention
mechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the
model&#x27;s capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting
with four popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars,
Stanford Dogs, and FGVC7 Plant Pathology. We also prove our model&#x27;s
interpretability via qualitative results.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes a novel framework for lung sound event detection,
segmenting continuous lung sound recordings into discrete events and performing
recognition on each event. Exploiting the lightweight nature of Temporal
Convolution Networks (TCNs) and their superior results compared to their
recurrent counterparts, we propose a lightweight, yet robust, and completely
interpretable framework for lung sound event detection. We propose the use of a
multi-branch TCN architecture and exploit a novel fusion strategy to combine
the resultant features from these branches. This not only allows the network to
retain the most salient information across different temporal granularities and
disregards irrelevant information, but also allows our network to process
recordings of arbitrary length. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on
multiple public and in-house benchmarks of irregular and noisy recordings of
the respiratory auscultation process for the identification of numerous
auscultation events including inhalation, exhalation, crackles, wheeze,
stridor, and rhonchi. We exceed the state-of-the-art results in all
evaluations. Furthermore, we empirically analyse the effect of the proposed
multi-branch TCN architecture and the feature fusion strategy and provide
quantitative and qualitative evaluations to illustrate their efficiency.
Moreover, we provide an end-to-end model interpretation pipeline that
interprets the operations of all the components of the proposed framework. Our
analysis of different feature fusion strategies shows that the proposed feature
concatenation method leads to better suppression of non-informative features,
which drastically reduces the classifier overhead resulting in a robust
lightweight network.The lightweight nature of our model allows it to be
deployed in end-user devices such as smartphones, and it has the ability to
generate predictions in real-time.</span>

producing realistic-looking images in the computer vision area. Recently,
GAN-based techniques are shown to be promising for spatio-temporal-based
applications such as trajectory prediction, events generation and time-series
data imputation. While several reviews for GANs in computer vision have been
presented, no one has considered addressing the practical applications and
challenges relevant to spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we have conducted a
comprehensive review of the recent developments of GANs for spatio-temporal
data. We summarise the application of popular GAN architectures for
spatio-temporal data and the common practices for evaluating the performance of
spatio-temporal applications with GANs. Finally, we point out future research

processes (GPs) have yet to fully capitalize on developments in computing
hardware. We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on
Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified
batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for
training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity
of exact GP inference from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$. Adapting this algorithm to
scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for
efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In
addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up
convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to
dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations.
Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP
inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.</span>

Hessian for a Riemannian manifold that is a quotient of a manifold embedded in
an inner product space with a non-constant metric function. Together with a
classical formula for projection, this allows us to evaluate Riemannian
gradient and Hessian for several families of metrics on classical manifolds,
including a family of metrics on Stiefel manifolds connecting both the constant
and canonical ambient metrics with closed-form geodesics. Using these formulas,
we derive Riemannian optimization frameworks on quotients of Stiefel manifolds,
including flag manifolds, and a new family of complete quotient metrics on the
manifold of positive-semidefinite matrices of fixed rank, considered as a
quotient of a product of Stiefel and positive-definite matrix manifold with
affine-invariant metrics. The method is procedural, and in many instances, the
Riemannian gradient and Hessian formulas could be derived by symbolic calculus.
The method extends the list of potential metrics that could be used in manifold

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) can be used in various ways to improve multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receive processing. Typical approaches
either augment a single processing step, such as symbol detection, or replace
multiple steps jointly by a single neural network (NN). These techniques
demonstrate promising results but often assume perfect channel state
information (CSI) or fail to satisfy the interpretability and scalability
constraints imposed by practical systems. In this paper, we propose a new
strategy which preserves the benefits of a conventional receiver, but enhances
specific parts with ML components. The key idea is to exploit the orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal structure to improve both the
demapping and the computation of the channel estimation error statistics.
Evaluation results show that the proposed ML-enhanced receiver beats practical
baselines on all considered scenarios, with significant gains at high speeds.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning solves pretext prediction tasks that do not require
annotations to learn feature representations. For vision tasks, pretext tasks
such as predicting rotation, solving jigsaw are solely created from the input
data. Yet, predicting this known information helps in learning representations
useful for downstream tasks. However, recent works have shown that wider and
deeper models benefit more from self-supervised learning than smaller models.
To address the issue of self-supervised pre-training of smaller models, we
propose Distill-on-the-Go (DoGo), a self-supervised learning paradigm using
single-stage online knowledge distillation to improve the representation
quality of the smaller models. We employ deep mutual learning strategy in which
two models collaboratively learn from each other to improve one another.
Specifically, each model is trained using self-supervised learning along with
distillation that aligns each model&#x27;s softmax probabilities of similarity
scores with that of the peer model. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets, learning objectives, and architectures to
demonstrate the potential of our proposed method. Our results show significant
performance gain in the presence of noisy and limited labels and generalization
to out-of-distribution data.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a new second-order inertial optimization method for machine
learning called INNA. It exploits the geometry of the loss function while only
requiring stochastic approximations of the function values and the generalized
gradients. This makes INNA fully implementable and adapted to large-scale
optimization problems such as the training of deep neural networks. The
algorithm combines both gradient-descent and Newton-like behaviors as well as
inertia. We prove the convergence of INNA for most deep learning problems. To
do so, we provide a well-suited framework to analyze deep learning loss
functions involving tame optimization in which we study a continuous dynamical
system together with its discrete stochastic approximations. We prove sublinear
convergence for the continuous-time differential inclusion which underlies our
algorithm. Additionally, we also show how standard optimization mini-batch
methods applied to non-smooth non-convex problems can yield a certain type of
spurious stationary points never discussed before. We address this issue by
providing a theoretical framework around the new idea of $D$-criticality; we
then give a simple asymptotic analysis of INNA. Our algorithm allows for using
an aggressive learning rate of $o(1/\log k)$. From an empirical viewpoint, we
show that INNA returns competitive results with respect to state of the art
(stochastic gradient descent, ADAGRAD, ADAM) on popular deep learning benchmark
problems.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-goal reinforcement learning is widely applied in planning and robot
manipulation. Two main challenges in multi-goal reinforcement learning are
sparse rewards and sample inefficiency. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) aims
to tackle the two challenges via goal relabeling. However, HER-related works
still need millions of samples and a huge computation. In this paper, we
propose Multi-step Hindsight Experience Replay (MHER), incorporating multi-step
relabeled returns based on $n$-step relabeling to improve sample efficiency.
Despite the advantages of $n$-step relabeling, we theoretically and
experimentally prove the off-policy $n$-step bias introduced by $n$-step
relabeling may lead to poor performance in many environments. To address the
above issue, two bias-reduced MHER algorithms, MHER($\lambda$) and Model-based
MHER (MMHER) are presented. MHER($\lambda$) exploits the $\lambda$ return while
MMHER benefits from model-based value expansions. Experimental results on
numerous multi-goal robotic tasks show that our solutions can successfully
alleviate off-policy $n$-step bias and achieve significantly higher sample
efficiency than HER and Curriculum-guided HER with little additional
computation beyond HER.</span>

machine learning problems. Although multiple adaptive methods were recently
studied, they mainly focus on either empirical or theoretical aspects and also
only work for specific problems by using specific adaptive learning rates. It
is desired to design a universal framework for practical algorithms of adaptive
gradients with theoretical guarantee to solve general problems. To fill this
gap, we propose a faster and universal framework of adaptive gradients (i.e.,
SUPER-ADAM) by introducing a universal adaptive matrix that includes most
existing adaptive gradient forms. Moreover, our framework can flexibly
integrates the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, our
novel framework provides the convergence analysis support for adaptive gradient
methods under the nonconvex setting. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our
new algorithm can achieve the best known complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of
nonconvex optimization, which matches the lower bound for stochastic smooth
nonconvex optimization. In numerical experiments, we employ various deep
learning tasks to validate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
existing adaptive algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Episodic reinforcement learning and contextual bandits are two widely studied
sequential decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement learning
generalizes contextual bandits and is often perceived to be more difficult due
to long planning horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions. The current
paper shows that the long planning horizon and the unknown state-dependent
transitions (at most) pose little additional difficulty on sample complexity.

We consider the episodic reinforcement learning with $S$ states, $A$ actions,
planning horizon $H$, total reward bounded by $1$, and the agent plays for $K$
episodes. We propose a new algorithm, \textbf{M}onotonic \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{P}ropagation (MVP), which relies on a new Bernstein-type bonus.
Compared to existing bonus constructions, the new bonus is tighter since it is
based on a well-designed monotonic value function. In particular, the
\emph{constants} in the bonus should be subtly setting to ensure optimism and
monotonicity.

We show MVP enjoys an $O\left(\left(\sqrt{SAK} + S^2A\right) \poly\log
\left(SAHK\right)\right)$ regret, approaching the
$\Omega\left(\sqrt{SAK}\right)$ lower bound of \emph{contextual bandits} up to
logarithmic terms. Notably, this result 1) \emph{exponentially} improves the
state-of-the-art polynomial-time algorithms by Dann et al. [2019] and Zanette
et al. [2019] in terms of the dependency on $H$, and 2) \emph{exponentially}
improves the running time in [Wang et al. 2020] and significantly improves the

more jobs for the society. CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is a powerful

high-dimensional data with the preservation of essential information. In the
context of manifold learning, we define that the representation after
information-lossless DR preserves the topological and geometric properties of
data manifolds formally, and propose a novel two-stage DR method, called
invertible manifold learning (inv-ML) to bridge the gap between theoretical
information-lossless and practical DR. The first stage includes a homeomorphic
sparse coordinate transformation to learn low-dimensional representations
without destroying topology and a local isometry constraint to preserve local
geometry. In the second stage, a linear compression is implemented for the
trade-off between the target dimension and the incurred information loss in
excessive DR scenarios. Experiments are conducted on seven datasets with a
neural network implementation of inv-ML, called i-ML-Enc. Empirically, i-ML-Enc
achieves invertible DR in comparison with typical existing methods as well as
reveals the characteristics of the learned manifolds. Through latent space
interpolation on real-world datasets, we find that the reliability of tangent

manifold-based DR algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning algorithms with empirical risk minimization are vulnerable
under distributional shifts due to the greedy adoption of all the correlations
found in training data. There is an emerging literature on tackling this
problem by minimizing the worst-case risk over an uncertainty set. However,
existing methods mostly construct ambiguity sets by treating all variables
equally regardless of the stability of their correlations with the target,
resulting in the overwhelmingly-large uncertainty set and low confidence of the
learner. In this paper, we propose a novel Stable Adversarial Learning (SAL)
algorithm that leverages heterogeneous data sources to construct a more
practical uncertainty set and conduct differentiated robustness optimization,
where covariates are differentiated according to the stability of their
correlations with the target. We theoretically show that our method is
tractable for stochastic gradient-based optimization and provide the
performance guarantees for our method. Empirical studies on both simulation and
real datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in terms of uniformly
good performance across unknown distributional shifts.</span>

                                        <span>In the online continual learning paradigm, agents must learn from a changing
distribution while respecting memory and compute constraints. Previous work in
this setting often tries to reduce catastrophic forgetting by limiting changes
in the space of model parameters. In this work we instead focus on the change
in representations of observed data that arises when previously unobserved
classes appear in the incoming data stream, and new classes must be
distinguished from previous ones. Starting from a popular approach, experience
replay, we consider metric learning based loss functions which, when adjusted
to appropriately select negative samples, can effectively nudge the learned
representations to be more robust to new future classes. We show that this
selection of negatives is in fact critical for reducing representation drift of
previously observed data. Motivated by this we further introduce a simple
adjustment to the standard cross entropy loss used in prior experience replay
that achieves similar effect. Our approach directly improves the performance of
experience replay for this setting, obtaining state-of-the-art results on
several existing benchmarks in online continual learning, while remaining
efficient in both memory and compute. We release an implementation of our
experiments at https://github.com/naderAsadi/AML</span>

                                        <span>For deep linear networks (DLN), various hyperparameters alter the dynamics of
training dramatically. We investigate how the rank of the linear map found by
gradient descent is affected by (1) the initialization norm and (2) the
addition of $L_{2}$ regularization on the parameters. For (1), we study two
regimes: (1a) the linear/lazy regime, for large norm initialization; (1b) a
\textquotedbl saddle-to-saddle\textquotedbl{} regime for small initialization
norm. In the (1a) setting, the dynamics of a DLN of any depth is similar to
that of a standard linear model, without any low-rank bias. In the (1b)
setting, we conjecture that throughout training, gradient descent approaches a
sequence of saddles, each corresponding to linear maps of increasing rank,
until reaching a minimal rank global minimum. We support this conjecture with a
partial proof and some numerical experiments. For (2), we show that adding a
$L_{2}$ regularization on the parameters corresponds to the addition to the
cost of a $L_{p}$-Schatten (quasi)norm on the linear map with $p&#x3D;\frac{2}{L}$
(for a depth-$L$ network), leading to a stronger low-rank bias as $L$ grows.
The effect of $L_{2}$ regularization on the loss surface depends on the depth:
for shallow networks, all critical points are either strict saddles or global
minima, whereas for deep networks, some local minima appear. We numerically
observe that these local minima can generalize better than global ones in some
settings.</span>

                                        <span>Factorization machine (FM) is a prevalent approach to modeling pairwise
(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into
the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model
arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has
demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

video-data from a wide-angle stereo camera system mounted at an urban
intersection into the forecast of cyclist trajectories. We extract features
from image and optical flow (OF) sequences using 3D convolutional neural
networks (3D-ConvNet) and combine them with features extracted from the
cyclist&#x27;s past trajectory to forecast future cyclist positions. By the use of
additional information, we are able to improve positional accuracy by about 7.5
% for our test dataset and by up to 22 % for specific motion types compared to
a method solely based on past trajectories. Furthermore, we compare the use of
image sequences to the use of OF sequences as additional information, showing
that OF alone leads to significant improvements in positional accuracy. By
training and testing our methods using a real-world dataset recorded at a
heavily frequented public intersection and evaluating the methods&#x27; runtimes, we
demonstrate the applicability in real traffic scenarios. Our code and parts of
our dataset are made publicly available.</span>

a key role in tumor evolution, and yet remains an understudied topic in
computational pathology. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is among the
first to hybrid local and global graph methods to profile orchestration and
interaction of cellular components. To address the challenge in hematolymphoid
cancers where the cell classes in TME are unclear, we first implemented cell
level unsupervised learning and identified two new cell subtypes. Local cell
graphs or supercells were built for each image by considering the individual
cell&#x27;s geospatial location and classes. Then, we applied supercell level
clustering and identified two new cell communities. In the end, we built global
graphs to abstract spatial interaction patterns and extract features for
disease diagnosis. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on H\&amp;E slides of 60
hematolymphoid neoplasm patients and further compared it with three cell level
graph-based algorithms, including the global cell graph, cluster cell graph,
and FLocK. The proposed algorithm achieves a mean diagnosis accuracy of 0.703
with the repeated 5-fold cross-validation scheme. In conclusion, our algorithm
shows superior performance over the existing methods and can be potentially
applied to other cancer types.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer models have achieved great progress on computer vision tasks
recently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by
their high representation ability for extracting informative features from
input images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep
architectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the
depth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between
shortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present
an augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable
parameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational
costs, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant
projection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
brings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers
without obviously increasing their parameters and FLOPs.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a novel Multi-Scale Spectrogram (MSS) modelling approach to
synthesise speech with an improved coarse and fine-grained prosody. We present
a generic multi-scale spectrogram prediction mechanism where the system first
predicts coarser scale mel-spectrograms that capture the suprasegmental
information in speech, and later uses these coarser scale mel-spectrograms to
predict finer scale mel-spectrograms capturing fine-grained prosody.

We present details for two specific versions of MSS called Word-level MSS and
Sentence-level MSS where the scales in our system are motivated by the
linguistic units. The Word-level MSS models word, phoneme, and frame-level
spectrograms while Sentence-level MSS models sentence-level spectrogram in
addition.

Subjective evaluations show that Word-level MSS performs statistically
significantly better compared to the baseline on two voices.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning enables machine learning algorithms to be trained over a
network of multiple decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange
of local datasets. Successfully deploying federated learning requires ensuring
that agents (e.g., mobile devices) faithfully execute the intended algorithm,
which has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this study, we first
use risk bounds to analyze how the key feature of federated learning,
unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data, affects agents&#x27; incentives to voluntarily
participate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms.

To be more specific, our analysis reveals that agents with less typical data
distributions and relatively more samples are more likely to opt out of or
tamper with federated learning algorithms. To this end, we formulate the first
faithful implementation problem of federated learning and design two faithful
federated learning mechanisms which satisfy economic properties, scalability,
and privacy. Further, the time complexity of computing all agents&#x27; payments in
the number of agents is $\mathcal{O}(1)$. First, we design a Faithful Federated
Learning (FFL) mechanism which approximates the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
payments via an incremental computation. We show that it achieves (probably
approximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and
some other economic properties (such as budget balance). Second, by
partitioning agents into several subsets, we present a scalable VCG mechanism
approximation. We further design a scalable and Differentially Private FFL
(DP-FFL) mechanism, the first differentially private faithful mechanism, that
maintains the economic properties. Our mechanism enables one to make three-way
performance tradeoffs among privacy, the iterations needed, and payment
accuracy loss.</span>

conditional models $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$ that form a cycle. This is motivated
by the observation that deep generative models, in addition to a likelihood
model $p(x|z)$, often also use an inference model $q(z|x)$ for data
representation, but they rely on a usually uninformative prior distribution
$p(z)$ to define a joint distribution, which may render problems like posterior
collapse and manifold mismatch. To explore the possibility to model a joint
distribution using only $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$, we study their compatibility and
determinacy, corresponding to the existence and uniqueness of a joint
distribution whose conditional distributions coincide with them. We develop a
general theory for novel and operable equivalence criteria for compatibility,
and sufficient conditions for determinacy. Based on the theory, we propose the
CyGen framework for cyclic-conditional generative modeling, including methods
to enforce compatibility and use the determined distribution to fit and
generate data. With the prior constraint removed, CyGen better fits data and
captures more representative features, supported by experiments showing better
generation and downstream classification performance.</span>

taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identify
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple
and plug-and-play open set recognition modules that can be attached to
pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for

noisy output using a U-Net model trained on denoising at various noise levels.
SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different

on a standard 8X face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ, comparing with SOTA
GAN methods. SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic

Gaussian DAG models which consist of a recursive set of linear regression

that satisfies our assumptions is the normal-Wishart distribution. Our analysis
is based on the following new characterization of the Wishart distribution: let
$W$ be an $n \times n$, $n \ge 3$, positive-definite symmetric matrix of random
variables and $f(W)$ be a pdf of $W$. Then, f$(W)$ is a Wishart distribution if

                                        <span>Graph signal processing is a ubiquitous task in many applications such as
sensor, social, transportation and brain networks, point cloud processing, and
graph neural networks. Graph signals are often corrupted through sensing
processes, and need to be restored for the above applications. In this paper,
we propose two graph signal restoration methods based on deep algorithm
unrolling (DAU). First, we present a graph signal denoiser by unrolling
iterations of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We then
propose a general restoration method for linear degradation by unrolling
iterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In the second method, the unrolled
ADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a submodule. Therefore, our restoration
method has a nested DAU structure. Thanks to DAU, parameters in the proposed
denoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Since the
proposed restoration methods are based on iterations of a (convex) optimization
algorithm, the method is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small
because we only need to tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We
solve two main problems in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1)
limited performance of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters
which are often determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph
neural networks that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for
graph signal denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and

gathered 55,608 public news articles from multiple real and satirical news
sources, composing one of the largest corpora for satire detection regardless
of language and the only one for the Romanian language. We provide an official
split of the text samples, such that training news articles belong to different
sources than test news articles, thus ensuring that models do not achieve high
performance simply due to overfitting. We conduct experiments with two
state-of-the-art deep neural models, resulting in a set of strong baselines for
our novel corpus. Our results show that the machine-level accuracy for satire
detection in Romanian is quite low (under 73% on the test set) compared to the
human-level accuracy (87%), leaving enough room for improvement in future
research.</span>

being one of the models for human and machine learning introduced by
E.~M.~Gold, is investigated. Particularly, naturally arising questions about
this learning setting, originating in results on learning from solely positive
information, are answered. By a carefully arranged argument learners can be
assumed to only change their hypothesis in case it is inconsistent with the
data (such a learning behavior is called \emph{conservative}). The deduced main
theorem states the relations between the most important delayable learning
success criteria, being the ones not ruined by a delayed in time hypothesis
output. Additionally, our investigations concerning the non-delayable
requirement of consistent learning underpin the claim for \emph{delayability}
being the right structural property to gain a deeper understanding concerning
the nature of learning success criteria. Moreover, we obtain an anomalous
\emph{hierarchy} when allowing for an increasing finite number of
\emph{anomalies} of the hypothesized language by the learner compared with the
language to be learned. In contrast to the vacillatory hierarchy for learning
from solely positive information, we observe a \emph{duality} depending on
whether infinitely many \emph{vacillations} between different (almost) correct
hypotheses are still considered a successful learning behavior.</span>

                                        <span>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying
deep learning models in an open-world setting. However, existing OOD detection
solutions can be brittle in the open world, facing various types of adversarial
OOD inputs. While methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data have emerged, our
analysis on illuminative examples reveals a key insight that the majority of
auxiliary OOD examples may not meaningfully improve or even hurt the decision
boundary of the OOD detector, which is also observed in empirical results on
real data. In this paper, we provide a theoretically motivated method,
Adversarial Training with informative Outlier Mining (ATOM), which improves the
robustness of OOD detection. We show that, by mining informative auxiliary OOD
data, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance, and somewhat
surprisingly, generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance under a broad family of classic and adversarial
OOD evaluation tasks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 in-distribution dataset,
ATOM reduces the FPR (at TPR 95%) by up to 57.99% under adversarial OOD inputs,
surpassing the previous best baseline by a large margin.</span>

                                        <span>Recent works demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can decrease the victim&#x27;s total reward
by manipulating the observations. Compared with adversarial attacks in
supervised learning, it is much more challenging to deceive a DRL model since
the adversary has to infer the environmental dynamics. To address this issue,
we reformulate the problem of adversarial attacks in function space and
separate the previous gradient based attacks into several subspace. Following
the analysis of the function space, we design a generic two-stage framework in
the subspace where the adversary lures the agent to a target trajectory or a
deceptive policy. In the first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking
the environment, and discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest
reward. The adversary then misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive policy
by perturbing the observations. Our method provides a tighter theoretical upper
bound for the attacked agent&#x27;s performance than the existing approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and we achieve
the state-of-the-art performance on both Atari and MuJoCo environments.</span>

                                        <span>Hash coding has been widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for
large-scale image retrieval. Given semantic annotations such as class labels
and pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and
generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images
may contain undefined semantic labels, which we call unseen images, zeor-shot
hashing techniques have been studied. However, existing zeor-shot hashing
methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle
multi-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive
zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In
order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge
is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then,
pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for
training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data.
Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that,
the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the
competing methods.</span>

However, existing group testing methods are oblivious to the circumstances of
contagion provided by contact tracing. Here, we build upon a well-known
semi-adaptive pool testing method, Dorfman&#x27;s method with imperfect tests, and
derive a simple group testing method based on dynamic programming that is
specifically designed to use the information provided by contact tracing.
Experiments using a variety of reproduction numbers and dispersion levels,
including those estimated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, show that
the pools found using our method result in a significantly lower number of
tests than those found using standard Dorfman&#x27;s method, especially when the
number of contacts of an infected individual is small. Moreover, our results
show that our method can be more beneficial when the secondary infections are

                                        <span>The standard problem setting in Dec-POMDPs is self-play, where the goal is to
find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through
self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step
reasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents&#x27; actions and thus
fail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To
address this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents
follow a policy $\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a
given, fixed policy ($\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken
by $\pi_1$. When $\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy
that does not rely on inferences based on other agents&#x27; behavior (an optimal
grounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy
from one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level
cognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which
may converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,
making it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC). OBL can be scaled to
high-dimensional settings with a fictitious transition mechanism and shows
strong performance in both a toy-setting and the benchmark human-AI &amp; ZSC
problem Hanabi.</span>

                                        <span>This work originates from the observation that today&#x27;s state of the art
statistical language models are impressive not only for their performance, but
also - and quite crucially - because they are built entirely from correlations
in unstructured text data. The latter observation prompts a fundamental
question that lies at the heart of this paper: What mathematical structure
exists in unstructured text data? We put forth enriched category theory as a
natural answer. We show that sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet, such
as those found in a corpus of text, form a category enriched over
probabilities. We then address a second fundamental question: How can this
information be stored and modeled in a way that preserves the categorical
structure? We answer this by constructing a functor from our enriched category
of text to a particular enriched category of reduced density operators. The
latter leverages the Loewner order on positive semidefinite operators, which
can further be interpreted as a toy example of entailment.</span>

                                        <span>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably the most popular
meta-learning algorithm nowadays, given its flexibility to incorporate various
model architectures and to be applied to different problems. Nevertheless, its
performance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms
dedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how
to train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that a large
number of gradient steps are needed for the inner loop update, which
contradicts the common usage of MAML for few-shot classification. Second, we
find that MAML is sensitive to the permutation of class assignments in
meta-testing: for a few-shot task of $N$ classes, there are exponentially many
ways to assign the learned initialization of the $N$-way classifier to the $N$
classes, leading to an unavoidably huge variance. Third, we investigate several
ways for permutation invariance and find that learning a shared classifier
initialization for all the classes performs the best. On benchmark datasets
such as MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name
UNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms, while keeping the simplicity of MAML without adding any extra
sub-networks.</span>

                                        <span>Studying neural network loss landscapes provides insights into the nature of
the underlying optimization problems. Unfortunately, loss landscapes are
notoriously difficult to visualize in a human-comprehensible fashion. One
common way to address this problem is to plot linear slices of the landscape,
for example from the initial state of the network to the final state after
optimization. On the basis of this analysis, prior work has drawn broader
conclusions about the difficulty of the optimization problem. In this paper, we
put inferences of this kind to the test, systematically evaluating how linear
interpolation and final performance vary when altering the data, choice of
initialization, and other optimizer and architecture design choices. Further,
we use linear interpolation to study the role played by individual layers and
substructures of the network. We find that certain layers are more sensitive to
the choice of initialization and optimizer hyperparameter settings, and we
exploit these observations to design custom optimization schemes. However, our
results cast doubt on the broader intuition that the presence or absence of
barriers when interpolating necessarily relates to the success of optimization.</span>

rotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. This is
often attributed to biases in the training dataset, and the lack of 2D
shift-invariance due to not respecting the sampling theorem. In this paper, we
challenge this hypothesis by training and testing on unbiased datasets, and
showing that networks are brittle to both small 3D perspective changes and
lighting variations which cannot be explained by dataset bias or lack of
shift-invariance. To find these in-distribution errors, we introduce an
evolution strategies (ES) based approach, which we call CMA-Search. Despite
training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera
and light variations, in over 71% cases CMA-Search can find camera parameters
in the vicinity of a correctly classified image which lead to in-distribution
misclassifications with &lt; 3.6% change in parameters. With lighting changes,
CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 33% cases with &lt; 11.6% change in
parameters. Finally, we extend this method to find misclassifications in the

                                        <span>Online metric learning has been widely exploited for large-scale data
classification due to the low computational cost. However, amongst online
practical scenarios where the features are evolving (e.g., some features are
vanished and some new features are augmented), most metric learning models
cannot be successfully applied to these scenarios, although they can tackle the
evolving instances efficiently. To address the challenge, we develop a new
online Evolving Metric Learning (EML) model for incremental and decremental
features, which can handle the instance and feature evolutions simultaneously
by incorporating with a smoothed Wasserstein metric distance. Specifically, our
model contains two essential stages: a Transforming stage (T-stage) and a
Inheriting stage (I-stage). For the T-stage, we propose to extract important
information from vanished features while neglecting non-informative knowledge,
and forward it into survived features by transforming them into a low-rank
discriminative metric space. It further explores the intrinsic low-rank
structure of heterogeneous samples to reduce the computation and memory burden
especially for highly-dimensional large-scale data. For the I-stage, we inherit
the metric performance of survived features from the T-stage and then expand to
include the new augmented features. Moreover, a smoothed Wasserstein distance
is utilized to characterize the similarity relationships among the
heterogeneous and complex samples, since the evolving features are not strictly
aligned in the different stages. In addition to tackling the challenges in
one-shot case, we also extend our model into multishot scenario. After deriving
an efficient optimization strategy for both T-stage and I-stage, extensive
experiments on several datasets verify the superior performance of our EML
model.</span>

optimization methods suffer from the size of the data. In this paper, we study
non-isotropic distributions of data and develop tools that aim at reducing
these dimensional costs by a dependency on an effective dimension rather than
the ambient one. Based on non-asymptotic estimates of the metric entropy of
ellipsoids -- that prove to generalize to infinite dimensions -- and on a
chaining argument, our uniform concentration bounds involve an effective
dimension instead of the global dimension, improving over existing results. We
show the importance of taking advantage of non-isotropic properties in learning
problems with the following applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art
results in statistical preconditioning for communication-efficient distributed
optimization, ii) we introduce a non-isotropic randomized smoothing for
non-smooth optimization. Both applications cover a class of functions that

accuracy is typically assessed using aggregate evasion rate, and it is an open
question whether aggregate evasion rate enables feature-level diagnosis on the
effect of adversarial perturbations on evasive predictions. In this paper, we
introduce a novel framework that harnesses explainable ML methods to guide
high-fidelity assessment of ML evasion attacks. Our framework enables
explanation-guided correlation analysis between pre-evasion perturbations and
post-evasion explanations. Towards systematic assessment of ML evasion attacks,
we propose and evaluate a novel suite of model-agnostic metrics for
sample-level and dataset-level correlation analysis. Using malware and image
classifiers, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse model
architectures and complementary feature representations. Our explanation-guided
correlation analysis reveals correlation gaps between adversarial samples and

explanation-guided evasion, we show the broader usage of our methodology for
assessing robustness of ML models.</span>

                                        <span>Graphs are a common model for complex relational data such as social networks
and protein interactions, and such data can evolve over time (e.g., new
friendships) and be noisy (e.g., unmeasured interactions). Link prediction aims
to predict future edges or infer missing edges in the graph, and has diverse
applications in recommender systems, experimental design, and complex systems.
Even though link prediction algorithms strongly depend on the set of edges in
the graph, existing approaches typically do not modify the graph topology to
improve performance. Here, we demonstrate how simply adding a set of edges,
which we call a \emph{proposal set}, to the graph as a pre-processing step can
improve the performance of several link prediction algorithms. The underlying
idea is that if the edges in the proposal set generally align with the
structure of the graph, link prediction algorithms are further guided towards
predicting the right edges; in other words, adding a proposal set of edges is a
signal-boosting pre-processing step. We show how to use existing link
prediction algorithms to generate effective proposal sets and evaluate this
approach on various synthetic and empirical datasets. We find that proposal
sets meaningfully improve the accuracy of link prediction algorithms based on
both neighborhood heuristics and graph neural networks. Code is available at

from vast amounts of data, and synthesize media that is nearly
indistinguishable from the real thing. However, positive tools can also be used
for negative purposes. In particular, cyber adversaries can use AI (such as
machine learning) to enhance their attacks and expand their campaigns.

Although offensive AI has been discussed in the past, there is a need to
analyze and understand the threat in the context of organizations. For example,
how does an AI-capable adversary impact the cyber kill chain? Does AI benefit
the attacker more than the defender? What are the most significant AI threats
facing organizations today and what will be their impact on the future?

In this survey, we explore the threat of offensive AI on organizations.
First, we present the background and discuss how AI changes the adversary&#x27;s
methods, strategies, goals, and overall attack model. Then, through a
literature review, we identify 33 offensive AI capabilities which adversaries
can use to enhance their attacks. Finally, through a user study spanning
industry and academia, we rank the AI threats and provide insights on the
adversaries.</span>

                                        <span>Remaining useful life prediction (RUL) is one of the key technologies of
condition-based maintenance, which is important to maintain the reliability and
safety of industrial equipments. While deep learning has achieved great success
in RUL prediction, existing methods have difficulties in processing long
sequences and extracting information from the sensor and time step aspects. In
this paper, we propose Dual Aspect Self-attention based on Transformer (DAST),
a novel deep RUL prediction method. DAST consists of two encoders, which work
in parallel to simultaneously extract features of different sensors and time
steps. Solely based on self-attention, the DAST encoders are more effective in
processing long data sequences, and are capable of adaptively learning to focus
on more important parts of input. Moreover, the parallel feature extraction
design avoids mutual influence of information from two aspects. Experimental
results on two real turbofan engine datasets show that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</span>

inference. An ideal model should be able to concisely approximate any
probability, while being also compatible with two main operations:
multiplications of two models (product rule) and marginalization with respect
to a subset of the random variables (sum rule). In this work, we show that a
recently proposed class of positive semi-definite (PSD) models for non-negative

both approximation and generalization capabilities of PSD models, showing that
they enjoy strong theoretical guarantees. Moreover, we show that we can perform

enjoying the same versatility of mixture models. Our results open the way to
applications of PSD models to density estimation, decision theory and

scientific machine learning. One key problem is the reconciliation between
modern data-driven approaches and first principles. Despite rapid advances in
machine learning techniques, embedding domain knowledge into data-driven models
remains a challenge. In this work, we present a universal learning framework
for extracting predictive models from nonlinear systems based on observations.
Our framework can readily incorporate first principle knowledge because it
naturally models nonlinear systems as continuous-time systems. This both
improves the extracted models&#x27; extrapolation power and reduces the amount of
data needed for training. In addition, our framework has the advantages of
robustness to observational noise and applicability to irregularly sampled
data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by learning predictive
models for a wide variety of systems including a stiff Van der Pol oscillator,
the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. For the Lorenz
system, different types of domain knowledge are incorporated to demonstrate the
strength of knowledge embedding in data-driven system identification.</span>

underlying dynamics of a system, yet it is generally infeasible to find them
from large-scale data without any prior knowledge or human insight. We propose
ConservNet to achieve this goal, a neural network that spontaneously discovers
a conserved quantity from grouped data where the members of each group share
invariants, similar to a general experimental setting where trajectories from
different trials are observed. As a neural network trained with a novel and
intuitive loss function called noise-variance loss, ConservNet learns the
hidden invariants in each group of multi-dimensional observables in a
data-driven, end-to-end manner. Our model successfully discovers underlying
invariants from the simulated systems having invariants as well as a real-world
double pendulum trajectory. Since the model is robust to various noises and
data conditions compared to baseline, our approach is directly applicable to
experimental data for discovering hidden conservation laws and further, general
relationships between variables.</span>

autoencoders (VAEs) offer scalable amortized posterior inference and fast
sampling. However, VAEs are also more and more outperformed by competing models
such as normalizing flows (NFs), deep-energy models, or the new denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). In this preliminary work, we improve
VAEs by demonstrating how DDPMs can be used for modelling the prior
distribution of the latent variables. The diffusion prior model improves upon
Gaussian priors of classical VAEs and is competitive with NF-based priors.
Finally, we hypothesize that hierarchical VAEs could similarly benefit from the
enhanced capacity of diffusion priors.</span>

equations (DEs) and reinforcement learning (RL) with domain knowledge. DEs
provide relationships between some, but not all, factors relevant to AD. We
assume that the missing relationships must satisfy general criteria about the
working of the brain, for e.g., maximizing cognition while minimizing the cost
of supporting cognition. This allows us to extract the missing relationships by
using RL to optimize an objective (reward) function that captures the above
criteria. We use our model consisting of DEs (as a simulator) and the trained
RL agent to predict individualized 10-year AD progression using baseline (year
0) features on synthetic and real data. The model was comparable or better at
predicting 10-year cognition trajectories than state-of-the-art learning-based
models. Our interpretable model demonstrated, and provided insights into,

                                        <span>This paper proposes a novel way of doing audio synthesis at the waveform
level using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for
generating waveforms, similar to wavenet \cite{oord2016wavenet}. This is fully
probabilistic, auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends
only on the previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used
wavenet architecture by up to 9\% on a similar dataset for predicting the next
step. Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which
audio samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show
how causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform
synthesis. We also show that this performance can be improved by another 2\% by
conditioning samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model
to synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of
potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer
architectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from
generating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid
the generation process.</span>

                                        <span>Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely used in modern
wireless networks thanks to its efficient handling of multipath environment.
However, it suffers from a poor peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which
requires a large power backoff, degrading the power amplifier (PA) efficiency.
In this work, we propose to use a neural network (NN) at the transmitter to
learn a high-dimensional modulation scheme allowing to control the PAPR and
adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). On the receiver side, a NN-based
receiver is implemented to carry out demapping of the transmitted bits. The two
NNs operate on top of OFDM, and are jointly optimized in and end-to-end manner
using a training algorithm that enforces constraints on the PAPR and ACLR.
Simulation results show that the learned waveforms enable higher information
rates than a tone reservation baseline, while satisfying predefined PAPR and
ACLR targets.</span>

increase the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems. However,
near-optimal solutions require a large amount of signaling exchange between
access points (APs) and the network controller (NC). In addition, the use of
hybrid beamforming in each AP reduces the number of power hungry RF chains, but
imposes a large computational complexity to find near-optimal precoders. In
this letter, we propose two unsupervised deep neural networks (DNN)

hybrid beamforming with zero or limited communication overhead between APs and

for predicting changes in spread at the short-term horizon, while milder

one-hidden-layer sparse networks. We first consider sparse networks with linear

                                        <span>Anomaly detection is a widely explored domain in machine learning. Many
models are proposed in the literature, and compared through different metrics
measured on various datasets. The most popular metrics used to compare
performances are F1-score, AUC and AVPR. In this paper, we show that F1-score
and AVPR are highly sensitive to the contamination rate. One consequence is
that it is possible to artificially increase their values by modifying the
train-test split procedure. This leads to misleading comparisons between
algorithms in the literature, especially when the evaluation protocol is not
well detailed. Moreover, we show that the F1-score and the AVPR cannot be used
to compare performances on different datasets as they do not reflect the
intrinsic difficulty of modeling such data. Based on these observations, we
claim that F1-score and AVPR should not be used as metrics for anomaly
detection. We recommend a generic evaluation procedure for unsupervised anomaly
detection, including the use of other metrics such as the AUC, which are more
robust to arbitrary choices in the evaluation protocol.</span>

strong ability to recognize outliers and defend adversaries. The basic idea is
to change the autoencoder from an unsupervised learning method into a
classifier. The CAE is a modified autoencoder, where the encoder is used to
compress samples with different labels into disjoint compression spaces and the
decoder is used to recover a sample with a given label from the corresponding
compression space. The encoder is used as a classifier and the decoder is used
to decide whether the classification given by the encoder is correct by
comparing the input sample with the output. Since adversary samples are seeming
inevitable for the current DNN framework, we introduce the list classification
based on CAE to defend adversaries, which outputs several labels and the
corresponding samples recovered by the CAE. The CAE is evaluated using the
MNIST dataset in great detail. It is shown that the CAE network can recognize
almost all outliers and the list classification contains the correct label for
almost all adversaries.</span>

semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To
counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is
known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the
Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks.
Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such
single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training.
Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of
single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we
address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic
segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the
robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not
increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training
considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of
meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with
multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic
segmentation.</span>

world, where training and test samples share the same label space. In this
paper, we target a more challenging and realistic setting: open-set learning
(OSL), where there exist test samples from the classes that are unseen during
training. Although researchers have designed many methods from the algorithmic
perspectives, there are few methods that provide generalization guarantees on
their ability to achieve consistent performance on different training samples
drawn from the same distribution. Motivated by the transfer learning and
probably approximate correct (PAC) theory, we make a bold attempt to study OSL
by proving its generalization error-given training samples with size n, the
estimation error will get close to order O_p(1/\sqrt{n}). This is the first
study to provide a generalization bound for OSL, which we do by theoretically
investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. According
to our theory, a novel algorithm, called auxiliary open-set risk (AOSR) is
proposed to address the OSL problem. Experiments verify the efficacy of AOSR.

                                        <span>Motivated by graph theory, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
traditionally structured as layers of neurons (nodes), which learn useful
information by the passage of data through interconnections (edges). In the
machine learning realm, graph structures (i.e., neurons and connections) of
ANNs have recently been explored using various graph-theoretic measures linked
to their predictive performance. On the other hand, in network science
(NetSci), certain graph measures including entropy and curvature are known to
provide insight into the robustness and fragility of real-world networks. In
this work, we use these graph measures to explore the robustness of various
ANNs to adversarial attacks. To this end, we (1) explore the design space of
inter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes of ANNs in the graph domain
and record their predictive performance after training under different types of
adversarial attacks, (2) use graph representations for both inter-layer and
intra-layers connectivity regimes to calculate various graph-theoretic
measures, including curvature and entropy, and (3) analyze the relationship
between these graph measures and the adversarial performance of ANNs. We show
that curvature and entropy, while operating in the graph domain, can quantify
the robustness of ANNs without having to train these ANNs. Our results suggest
that the real-world networks, including brain networks, financial networks, and
social networks may provide important clues to the neural architecture search
for robust ANNs. We propose a search strategy that efficiently finds robust
ANNs amongst a set of well-performing ANNs without having a need to train all
of these ANNs.</span>

on out-of-distribution data, accuracies on in- versus out-of-distribution data
are widely observed to follow a single linear trend when evaluated across a
testbed of models. Models that are more accurate on the out-of-distribution
data relative to this baseline exhibit &quot;effective robustness&quot; and are
exceedingly rare. Identifying such models, and understanding their properties,
is key to improving out-of-distribution performance. We conduct a thorough
empirical investigation of effective robustness during fine-tuning and
surprisingly find that models pre-trained on larger datasets exhibit effective
robustness during training that vanishes at convergence. We study how
properties of the data influence effective robustness, and we show that it
increases with the larger size, more diversity, and higher example difficulty
of the dataset. We also find that models that display effective robustness are
able to correctly classify 10% of the examples that no other current testbed
model gets correct. Finally, we discuss several strategies for scaling
effective robustness to the high-accuracy regime to improve the
out-of-distribution accuracy of state-of-the-art models.</span>

unified adaptive matrices used in the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}.
Specifically, we propose a fast adaptive gradient decent ascent (AdaGDA) method
based on the basic momentum technique, which reaches a low sample complexity of
$O(\kappa^4\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without
large batches, which improves the existing result of adaptive minimax
optimization method by a factor of $O(\sqrt{\kappa})$. Moreover, we present an
accelerated version of AdaGDA (VR-AdaGDA) method based on the momentum-based
variance reduced technique, which achieves the best known sample complexity of
$O(\kappa^3\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without
large batches. Further assume the bounded Lipschitz parameter of objective

of $O(\kappa^{2.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ with the mini-batch size $O(\kappa)$. In

                                        <span>Stochastic Approximation (SA) is a popular approach for solving fixed-point
equations where the information is corrupted by noise. In this paper, we
consider an SA involving a contraction mapping with respect to an arbitrary
norm, and show its finite-sample error bounds while using different stepsizes.
The idea is to construct a smooth Lyapunov function using the generalized
Moreau envelope, and show that the iterates of SA have negative drift with
respect to that Lyapunov function. Our result is applicable in Reinforcement
Learning (RL). In particular, we use it to establish the first-known
convergence rate of the V-trace algorithm for off-policy TD-learning. Moreover,
we also use it to study TD-learning in the on-policy setting, and recover the
existing state-of-the-art results for $Q$-learning. Importantly, our
construction results in only a logarithmic dependence of the convergence bound
on the size of the state-space.</span>

robustness of trained models, where data being less/more vulnerable to the
given attack are assigned smaller/larger weights during training. However, when
tested on attacks different from the given attack simulated in training, the
robustness may drop significantly (e.g., even worse than no reweighting). In
this paper, we study this problem and propose our solution--locally reweighted
adversarial training (LRAT). The rationale behind IRAT is that we do not need
to pay much attention to an instance that is already safe under the attack. We
argue that the safeness should be attack-dependent, so that for the same
instance, its weight can change given different attacks based on the same
model. Thus, if the attack simulated in training is mis-specified, the weights
of IRAT are misleading. To this end, LRAT pairs each instance with its
adversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while
performing no global reweighting--the rationale is to fit the instance itself
if it is immune to the attack, but not to skip the pair, in order to passively
defend different attacks in future. Experiments show that LRAT works better
than both IRAT (i.e., global reweighting) and the standard AT (i.e., no
reweighting) when trained with an attack and tested on different attacks.</span>

decay may improve neural network training, some recent works show their joint
usage may cause instabilities at the late stages of training. Other works, in
contrast, show convergence to the equilibrium, i.e., the stabilization of
training metrics. In this paper, we study this contradiction and show that
instead of converging to a stable equilibrium, the training dynamics converge
to consistent periodic behavior. That is, the training process regularly
exhibits instabilities which, however, do not lead to complete training
failure, but cause a new period of training. We rigorously investigate the
mechanism underlying this discovered periodic behavior both from an empirical

                                        <span>The memorization effect of deep neural network (DNN) plays a pivotal role in
many state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property,
the early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of
training, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early
stopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be
considered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter
layers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former
counterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the
whole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each
other, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to
separate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address
this problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at
once, we initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a
relatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the
latter DNN layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers
fixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as
progressive early stopping (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the
early stopping, PES can help to obtain more promising and stable results.
Furthermore, by combining PES with existing approaches on noisy label training,
we achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks.</span>

number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled
source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods
assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which
ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple
source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster
R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which
can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power.
Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo
target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to
conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features,
respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second,
we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal
parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in
different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region
proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract

                                        <span>Procedural fairness has been a public concern, which leads to controversy
when making decisions with respect to protected classes, such as race, social
status, and disability. Some protected classes can be inferred according to
some safe proxies like surname and geolocation for the race. Hence, implicitly
utilizing the predicted protected classes based on the related proxies when
making decisions is an efficient approach to circumvent this issue and seek
just decisions. In this article, we propose a hierarchical random forest model
for prediction without explicitly involving protected classes. Simulation
experiments are conducted to show the performance of the hierarchical random
forest model. An example is analyzed from Boston police interview records to
illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in
representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node
embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing
information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work
has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a
graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well
as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for
discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to
the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a
novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph
Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a
hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message
passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge
representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain
holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation
learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph
representation and generation performance, on which our method largely
outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge
representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms
state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only
because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its
lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective
message passing.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many graph-based
tasks. Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with the adaptive locality
ability, which enables measuring the importance of neighboring nodes to the
target node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific
mechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the
topology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring
nodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we
introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the
strength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature
Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality
ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To
improve the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly
transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary
Negative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then,
we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN
effectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is
improved significantly. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node
classification benchmark datasets. This study deepens the understanding of how
to utilize advanced topology information and assign the importance of
neighboring nodes from the perspective of graph curvature and encourages us to
bridge the gap between graph theory and neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>We investigate a correspondence between two formalisms for discrete
probabilistic modeling: probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and tensor
networks (TNs), a powerful modeling framework for simulating complex quantum
systems. The graphical calculus of PGMs and TNs exhibits many similarities,
with discrete undirected graphical models (UGMs) being a special case of TNs.
However, more general probabilistic TN models such as Born machines (BMs)
employ complex-valued hidden states to produce novel forms of correlation among
the probabilities. While representing a new modeling resource for capturing
structure in discrete probability distributions, this behavior also renders the
direct application of standard PGM tools impossible. We aim to bridge this gap
by introducing a hybrid PGM-TN formalism that integrates quantum-like
correlations into PGM models in a principled manner, using the
physically-motivated concept of decoherence. We first prove that applying
decoherence to the entirety of a BM model converts it into a discrete UGM, and
conversely, that any subgraph of a discrete UGM can be represented as a
decohered BM. This method allows a broad family of probabilistic TN models to
be encoded as partially decohered BMs, a fact we leverage to combine the
representational strengths of both model families. We experimentally verify the
performance of such hybrid models in a sequential modeling task, and identify
promising uses of our method within the context of existing applications of
graphical models.</span>

graphs. We generalize a previously known distance measure on graphs (Graph
Diffusion Distance), thereby allowing it to be tuned to minimize an arbitrary
loss function. Because all steps involved in calculating this modified GDD are
differentiable, we demonstrate that it is possible for a small neural network
model to learn edge weights which minimize loss. GDD alone does not effectively
discriminate between graphs constructed from shoot apical meristem images of
wild-type vs. mutant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} specimens. However, training
edge weights and kernel parameters with contrastive loss produces a learned
distance metric with large margins between these graph categories. We
demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple
k-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also
demonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis:
once trained, we use our model to compute the distance between the biological
graphs and a set of graphs output by a cell division simulator. This allows us
to identify simulation parameter regimes which are similar to each class of
graph in our original dataset.</span>

                                        <span>We study the selective learning problem introduced by Qiao and Valiant
(2019), in which the learner observes $n$ labeled data points one at a time. At
a time of its choosing, the learner selects a window length $w$ and a model
$\hat\ell$ from the model class $\mathcal{L}$, and then labels the next $w$
data points using $\hat\ell$. The excess risk incurred by the learner is
defined as the difference between the average loss of $\hat\ell$ over those $w$
data points and the smallest possible average loss among all models in
$\mathcal{L}$ over those $w$ data points.

We give an improved algorithm, termed the hybrid exponential weights
algorithm, that achieves an expected excess risk of $O((\log\log|\mathcal{L}| +
\log\log n)/\log n)$. This result gives a doubly exponential improvement in the
dependence on $|\mathcal{L}|$ over the best known bound of
$O(\sqrt{|\mathcal{L}|/\log n})$. We complement the positive result with an
almost matching lower bound, which suggests the worst-case optimality of the
algorithm.

We also study a more restrictive family of learning algorithms that are
bounded-recall in the sense that when a prediction window of length $w$ is
chosen, the learner&#x27;s decision only depends on the most recent $w$ data points.
We analyze an exponential weights variant of the ERM algorithm in Qiao and
Valiant (2019). This new algorithm achieves an expected excess risk of
$O(\sqrt{\log |\mathcal{L}|/\log n})$, which is shown to be nearly optimal
among all bounded-recall learners. Our analysis builds on a generalized version
of the selective mean prediction problem in Drucker (2013); Qiao and Valiant
(2019), which may be of independent interest.</span>

                                        <span>When a deep learning model is deployed in the wild, it can encounter test
data drawn from distributions different from the training data distribution and
suffer drop in performance. For safe deployment, it is essential to estimate
the accuracy of the pre-trained model on the test data. However, the labels for
the test inputs are usually not immediately available in practice, and
obtaining them can be expensive. This observation leads to two challenging
tasks: (1) unsupervised accuracy estimation, which aims to estimate the
accuracy of a pre-trained classifier on a set of unlabeled test inputs; (2)
error detection, which aims to identify mis-classified test inputs. In this
paper, we propose a principled and practically effective framework that
simultaneously addresses the two tasks. The proposed framework iteratively
learns an ensemble of models to identify mis-classified data points and
performs self-training to improve the ensemble with the identified points.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our framework enjoys provable guarantees
for both accuracy estimation and error detection under mild conditions readily
satisfied by practical deep learning models. Along with the framework, we
proposed and experimented with two instantiations and achieved state-of-the-art
results on 59 tasks. For example, on iWildCam, one instantiation reduces the
estimation error for unsupervised accuracy estimation by at least 70% and
improves the F1 score for error detection by at least 4.7% compared to existing
methods.</span>

                                        <span>This paper surveys the field of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. The
combination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has gained
increased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from
single-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is
inherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on the joint actions
of multiple players and (b) the computational complexity of functions
increases. We present the most common multiagent problem representations and
their main challenges, and identify five research areas that address one or
more of these challenges: centralised training and decentralised execution,
opponent modelling, communication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping.
We find that many computational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are
not generalisable to other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of
dimensionality or nonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology
capture promising relevant behaviours such as communication and coordination.
We suggest that, for multiagent reinforcement learning to be successful, future
research addresses these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach to open
up new possibilities for more human-oriented solutions in multiagent
reinforcement learning.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years there has been a special interest in word embeddings as a new
approach to convert words to vectors. It has been a focal point to understand
how much of the semantics of the the words has been transferred into embedding
vectors. This is important as the embedding is going to be used as the basis
for downstream NLP applications and it will be costly to evaluate the
application end-to-end in order to identify quality of the used embedding
model. Generally the word embeddings are evaluated through a number of tests,
including analogy test. In this paper we propose a test framework for Persian
embedding models. Persian is a low resource language and there is no rich
semantic benchmark to evaluate word embedding models for this language. In this
paper we introduce an evaluation framework including a hand crafted Persian SAT
based analogy dataset, a colliquial test set (specific to Persian) and a
benchmark to study the impact of various parameters on the semantic evaluation
task.</span>

                                        <span>Obesity is known to lower the quality of life substantially. It is often
associated with increased chances of non-communicable diseases such as
diabetes, cardiovascular problems, different types of cancers, etc. Evidence
suggests that diet-related mobile applications play a vital role in assisting
an individual in making healthier choices and keeping track of food intake.
However, due to an abundance of similar applications, it becomes pertinent to
evaluate each of them in terms of functionality, usability, and possible design
issues to truly determine state-of-the-art solutions for the future. Since
these applications involve implementing multiple user requirements and
recommendations from different dietitians, the evaluation becomes quite
complex. Therefore, this study aims to review existing dietary applications at
length to highlight key features and problems that enhance or undermine an
application&#x27;s usability. For this purpose, we have examined the published
literature from various scientific databases of the CINAHL, Science Direct, and
PUBMED. Out of our findings, fifty-six primary studies met our inclusion
criteria after filtering out titles, abstracts, and full text. A total of 35
apps are analyzed from the selected studies. Our detailed analysis concluded
the comprehensiveness of freely available mHealth applications from users and
dietitians&#x27; frames of reference. Furthermore, we have also specified potential
future challenges and stated recommendations to help develop clinically
accurate diet-related applications.</span>

                                        <span>Hashing plays an important role in information retrieval, due to its low
storage and high speed of processing. Among the techniques available in the
literature, multi-modal hashing, which can encode heterogeneous multi-modal
features into compact hash codes, has received particular attention. Most of
the existing multi-modal hashing methods adopt the fixed weighting factors to
fuse multiple modalities for any query data, which cannot capture the variation
of different queries. Besides, many methods introduce hyper-parameters to
balance many regularization terms that make the optimization harder. Meanwhile,
it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to set proper parameter values. The
limitations may significantly hinder their promotion in real applications. In
this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method that is inspired by the
Hadamard matrix. The proposed method captures the multi-modal feature
information in an adaptive manner and preserves the discriminative semantic
information in the hash codes. Our framework is flexible and involves a very
few hyper-parameters. Extensive experimental results show the method is
effective and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms.</span>

rely on text annotation, such as human generated captions or machine generated
automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the
Audio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a
shared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To
circumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations
from randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train
AVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,
and evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet&#x27;s learned
representations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn
audio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly
processes raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a
multi-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval. Our code,
data, and trained models will be released at avlnet.csail.mit.edu</span>

platforms. While multimodal emotion recognition techniques are gaining research
attention, there is a lack of deeper understanding on how visual and non-visual
features can be used to better recognize emotions in certain contexts, but not
others. This study analyzes the interplay between the effects of multimodal
emotion features derived from facial expressions, tone and text in conjunction
with two key contextual factors: i) gender of the speaker, and ii) duration of
the emotional episode. Using a large public dataset of 2,176 manually annotated
YouTube videos, we found that while multimodal features consistently
outperformed bimodal and unimodal features, their performance varied
significantly across different emotions, gender and duration contexts.
Multimodal features performed particularly better for male speakers in
recognizing most emotions. Furthermore, multimodal features performed
particularly better for shorter than for longer videos in recognizing neutral
and happiness, but not sadness and anger. These findings offer new insights
towards the development of more context-aware emotion recognition and
empathetic systems.</span>

probabilistic, auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends
only on the previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used
wavenet architecture by up to 9\% on a similar dataset for predicting the next
step. Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which
audio samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show
how causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform
synthesis. We also show that this performance can be improved by another 2\% by
conditioning samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model
to synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of
potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer
architectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from
generating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid
the generation process.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, Word-level Sign Language Recognition (WSLR) research has
gained popularity in the computer vision community, and thus various approaches
have been proposed. Among these approaches, the method using I3D network
achieves the highest recognition accuracy on large public datasets for WSLR.
However, the method with I3D only utilizes appearance information of the upper
body of the signers to recognize sign language words. On the other hand, in
WSLR, the information of local regions, such as the hand shape and facial
expression, and the positional relationship among the body and both hands are
important. Thus in this work, we utilized local region images of both hands and
face, along with skeletal information to capture local information and the
positions of both hands relative to the body, respectively. In other words, we
propose a novel multi-stream WSLR framework, in which a stream with local
region images and a stream with skeletal information are introduced by
extending I3D network to improve the recognition accuracy of WSLR. From the
experimental results on WLASL dataset, it is evident that the proposed method
has achieved about 15% improvement in the Top-1 accuracy than the existing
conventional methods.</span>

Recently, with the rapid advancement of emotional intelligence and the
explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated
to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this survey, we will
comprehensively review the development of AICA in the recent two decades,
especially focusing on the state-of-the-art methods with respect to three main
challenges -- the affective gap, perception subjectivity, and label noise and
absence. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models
that have been widely employed in AICA and description of available datasets
for performing evaluation with quantitative comparison of label noise and
dataset bias. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on
(1) emotion feature extraction, including both handcrafted and deep features,
(2) learning methods on dominant emotion recognition, personalized emotion
prediction, emotion distribution learning, and learning from noisy data or few
labels, and (3) AICA based applications. Finally, we discuss some challenges
and promising research directions in the future, such as image content and
context understanding, group emotion clustering, and viewer-image interaction.</span>
