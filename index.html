over a knowledge graph. For this task, we propose LASAGNE (muLti-task semAntic
parSing with trAnsformer and Graph atteNtion nEtworks). It is the first
approach, which employs a transformer architecture extended with Graph
Attention Networks for multi-task neural semantic parsing. LASAGNE uses a
transformer model for generating the base logical forms, while the Graph
Attention model is used to exploit correlations between (entity) types and
predicates to produce node representations. LASAGNE also includes a novel
entity recognition module which detects, links, and ranks all relevant entities
in the question context. We evaluate LASAGNE on a standard dataset for complex
sequential question answering, on which it outperforms existing baseline
averages on all question types. Specifically, we show that LASAGNE improves the
F1-score on eight out of ten question types; in some cases, the increase in
F1-score is more than 20% compared to the state of the art.</span>

This year we have focused on experimenting with new ideas on a limited time
budget. Our system is based on splitting the EUD graph into several trees,
based on linguistic criteria. We predict these trees using a sequence-labelling
parser and combine them into an EUD graph. The results were relatively poor,
although not a total disaster and could probably be improved with some

                                        <span>In spoken conversational question answering (SCQA), the answer to the
corresponding question is generated by retrieving and then analyzing a fixed
spoken document, including multi-part conversations. Most SCQA systems have
considered only retrieving information from ordered utterances. However, the
sequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken
conversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order
may severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we
introduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence
discrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly
capture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken
documents. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the
auxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards
more coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the
proposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more
coherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance
gains compared to the original pre-trained language models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Spoken-CoQA dataset.</span>

                                        <span>QA models based on pretrained language mod-els have achieved remarkable
performance on various benchmark datasets.However, QA models do not generalize
well to unseen data that falls outside the training distribution, due to
distributional shifts.Data augmentation (DA) techniques which drop/replace
words have shown to be effective in regularizing the model from overfitting to
the training data.Yet, they may adversely affect the QA tasks since they incur
semantic changes that may lead to wrong answers for the QA task. To tackle this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective DA method based on a stochastic
noise generator, which learns to perturb the word embedding of the input
questions and context without changing their semantics. We validate the
performance of the QA models trained with our word embedding perturbation on a
single source dataset, on five different target domains.The results show that
our method significantly outperforms the baselineDA methods. Notably, the model
trained with ours outperforms the model trained with more than 240K

Answering (QA) systems over knowledge graphs. Such methods provide the
flexibility to handle QA datasets with complex queries and a large number of
entities. In this work, we propose a novel framework named CARTON, which
performs multi-task semantic parsing for handling the problem of conversational
question answering over a large-scale knowledge graph. Our framework consists
of a stack of pointer networks as an extension of a context transformer model
for parsing the input question and the dialog history. The framework generates
a sequence of actions that can be executed on the knowledge graph. We evaluate
CARTON on a standard dataset for complex sequential question answering on which
CARTON outperforms all baselines. Specifically, we observe performance
improvements in F1-score on eight out of ten question types compared to the
previous state of the art. For logical reasoning questions, an improvement of
11 absolute points is reached.</span>

intelligent robots to interpret human language better and act accordingly. We
model the social network as an And-or Graph, named SocAoG, for the consistency
of relations among a group and leveraging attributes as inference cues.
Moreover, we formulate a sequential structure prediction task, and propose an
$\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ strategy to incrementally parse SocAoG for the
dynamic inference upon any incoming utterance: (i) an $\alpha$ process
predicting attributes and relations conditioned on the semantics of dialogues,
(ii) a $\beta$ process updating the social relations based on related
attributes, and (iii) a $\gamma$ process updating individual&#x27;s attributes based
on interpersonal social relations. Empirical results on DialogRE and MovieGraph
show that our model infers social relations more accurately than the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study shows the three
processes complement each other, and the case study demonstrates the dynamic
relational inference.</span>

healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it is crucial to recognize how
they shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making
processes. Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained
language models (LMs) that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting
undesirable representational biases - harmful biases resulting from
stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations involving gender, race,
religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards improving the fairness
of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational biases before
proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we
propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our
empirical results and human evaluation demonstrate effectiveness in mitigating
bias while retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text

                                        <span>Spoken conversational question answering (SCQA) requires machines to model
complex dialogue flow given the speech utterances and text corpora. Different
from traditional text question answering (QA) tasks, SCQA involves audio signal
processing, passage comprehension, and contextual understanding. However, ASR
systems introduce unexpected noisy signals to the transcriptions, which result
in performance degradation on SCQA. To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,
a novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies
both cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized
embedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance
improvements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation
framework to distill the ASR-robust knowledge from the estimated probabilities
of the teacher model to the student. We conduct extensive experiments on the
Spoken-CoQA dataset and demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable
performance in this task.</span>

put on interpreting their representations. One of the most prominent approaches
is structural probing (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), where a linear projection of
word embeddings is performed in order to approximate the topology of dependency
structures. In this work, we introduce a new type of structural probing, where
the linear projection is decomposed into 1. isomorphic space rotation; 2.
linear scaling that identifies and scales the most relevant dimensions. In
addition to syntactic dependency, we evaluate our method on novel tasks
(lexical hypernymy and position in a sentence). We jointly train the probes for
multiple tasks and experimentally show that lexical and syntactic information
is separated in the representations. Moreover, the orthogonal constraint makes
the Structural Probes less vulnerable to memorization.</span>

one&#x27;s own experience - are often used in everyday conversations. So far, PNs
have mainly been explored for tasks such as valence prediction or emotion
classification (e.g. happy, sad). However, these tasks might overlook more
fine-grained information that could prove to be relevant for understanding PNs.
In this work, we propose a novel task for Narrative Understanding: Emotion
Carrier Recognition (ECR). Emotion carriers, the text fragments that carry the
emotions of the narrator (e.g. loss of a grandpa, high school reunion), provide
a fine-grained description of the emotion state. We explore the task of ECR in
a corpus of PNs manually annotated with emotion carriers and investigate
different machine learning models for the task. We propose evaluation
strategies for ECR including metrics that can be appropriate for different
tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Mental health conditions remain underdiagnosed even in countries with common
access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently
predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications
for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health
disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily
smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without
identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable
information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we
study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile
behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using
computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of
mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app
usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to
predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate
representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate
user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal
representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward
the performance-privacy frontier.</span>

now widely used for source code processing, due to the format similarity
between source code and text. In contrast to natural language, source code is
strictly structured, i.e., it follows the syntax of the programming language.
Several recent works develop Transformer modifications for capturing syntactic
information in source code. The drawback of these works is that they do not
compare to each other and consider different tasks. In this work, we conduct a
thorough empirical study of the capabilities of Transformers to utilize
syntactic information in different tasks. We consider three tasks (code
completion, function naming and bug fixing) and re-implement different
syntax-capturing modifications in a unified framework. We show that
Transformers are able to make meaningful predictions based purely on syntactic
information and underline the best practices of taking the syntactic
information into account for improving the performance of the model.</span>

observed event happened rather than some other counterfactual event (the
contrast case). Despite the influential role that contrastivity plays in how
humans explain, this property is largely missing from current methods for
explaining NLP models. We present Minimal Contrastive Editing (MiCE), a method
for producing contrastive explanations of model predictions in the form of
edits to inputs that change model outputs to the contrast case. Our experiments
across three tasks--binary sentiment classification, topic classification, and
multiple-choice question answering--show that MiCE is able to produce edits
that are not only contrastive, but also minimal and fluent, consistent with
human contrastive edits. We demonstrate how MiCE edits can be used for two use
cases in NLP system development--debugging incorrect model outputs and

                                        <span>Spoken language understanding (SLU) topic has seen a lot of progress these
last three years, with the emergence of end-to-end neural approaches. Spoken
language understanding refers to natural language processing tasks related to
semantic extraction from speech signal, like named entity recognition from
speech or slot filling task in a context of human-machine dialogue.
Classically, SLU tasks were processed through a cascade approach that consists
in applying, firstly, an automatic speech recognition process, followed by a
natural language processing module applied to the automatic transcriptions.
These three last years, end-to-end neural approaches, based on deep neural
networks, have been proposed in order to directly extract the semantics from
speech signal, by using a single neural model. More recent works on
self-supervised training with unlabeled data open new perspectives in term of
performance for automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.
In this paper, we present a brief overview of the recent advances on the French
MEDIA benchmark dataset for SLU, with or without the use of additional data. We
also present our last results that significantly outperform the current
state-of-the-art with a Concept Error Rate (CER) of 11.2%, instead of 13.6% for
the last state-of-the-art system presented this year.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in transformers have enabled Table Question Answering (Table
QA) systems to achieve high accuracy and SOTA results on open domain datasets
like WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL. Such transformers are frequently
pre-trained on open-domain content such as Wikipedia, where they effectively
encode questions and corresponding tables from Wikipedia as seen in Table QA
dataset. However, web tables in Wikipedia are notably flat in their layout,
with the first row as the sole column header. The layout lends to a relational
view of tables where each row is a tuple. Whereas, tables in domain-specific
business or scientific documents often have a much more complex layout,
including hierarchical row and column headers, in addition to having
specialized vocabulary terms from that domain.

To address this problem, we introduce the domain-specific Table QA dataset
AIT-QA (Airline Industry Table QA). The dataset consists of 515 questions
authored by human annotators on 116 tables extracted from public U.S. SEC
filings (publicly available at: https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) of major
airline companies for the fiscal years 2017-2019. We also provide annotations
pertaining to the nature of questions, marking those that require hierarchical
headers, domain-specific terminology, and paraphrased forms. Our zero-shot
baseline evaluation of three transformer-based SOTA Table QA methods - TaPAS
(end-to-end), TaBERT (semantic parsing-based), and RCI (row-column
encoding-based) - clearly exposes the limitation of these methods in this
practical setting, with the best accuracy at just 51.8\% (RCI). We also present
pragmatic table preprocessing steps used to pivot and project these complex
tables into a layout suitable for the SOTA Table QA models.</span>

important to understand the quality of the advice they receive. In this paper,
we explore the role of expertise in responses provided to help-seeking posts
regarding mental health. We study the differences between (1) interactions with
peers; and (2) interactions with self-identified mental health professionals.
First, we show that a classifier can distinguish between these two groups,
indicating that their language use does in fact differ. To understand this
difference, we perform several analyses addressing engagement aspects,
including whether their comments engage the support-seeker further as well as
linguistic aspects, such as dominant language and linguistic style matching.
Our work contributes toward the developing efforts of understanding how health
experts engage with health information- and support-seekers in social networks.
More broadly, it is a step toward a deeper understanding of the styles of
interactions that cultivate supportive engagement in online communities.</span>

phrase, tail noun phrase) triples such as (tesla, return to, new york)
extracted from a corpus using OpenIE tools. While OpenKGs are easy to bootstrap
for a domain, they are very sparse and far from being directly usable in an end
task. Therefore, the task of predicting new facts, i.e., link prediction,
becomes an important step while using these graphs in downstream tasks such as
text comprehension, question answering, and web search query recommendation.
Learning embeddings for OpenKGs is one approach for link prediction that has
received some attention lately. However, on careful examination, we found that
current OpenKG link prediction algorithms often predict noun phrases (NPs) with
incompatible types for given noun and relation phrases. We address this problem
in this work and propose OKGIT that improves OpenKG link prediction using novel
type compatibility score and type regularization. With extensive experiments on
multiple datasets, we show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance while producing type compatible NPs in the link prediction task.</span>

dimensional vectors, enabling efficient speech search and discovery. Previous
work explored how embeddings can be obtained in zero-resource settings where no
labelled data is available in the target language. The current best approach
uses transfer learning: a single supervised multilingual model is trained using
labelled data from multiple well-resourced languages and then applied to a
target zero-resource language (without fine-tuning). However, it is still
unclear how the specific choice of training languages affect downstream
performance. Concretely, here we ask whether it is beneficial to use training
languages related to the target. Using data from eleven languages spoken in
Southern Africa, we experiment with adding data from different language
families while controlling for the amount of data per language. In word
discrimination and query-by-example search evaluations, we show that training
on languages from the same family gives large improvements. Through
finer-grained analysis, we show that training on even just a single related
language gives the largest gain. We also find that adding data from unrelated
languages generally doesn&#x27;t hurt performance.</span>

Evaluations show that the source language can be reconstructed with high

                                        <span>OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology
to produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary
supplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,
or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created
SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations
from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing
28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using
SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a
PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our
knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug
interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic
plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%
more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT
model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,
improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.
SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings
identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed
DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.
DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG
that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the
nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using
SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend
SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find
potential DS-Drug interactions.</span>

                                        <span>Given the clinical notes written in electronic health records (EHRs), it is
challenging to predict the diagnostic codes which is formulated as a
multi-label classification task. The large set of labels, the hierarchical
dependency, and the imbalanced data make this prediction task extremely hard.
Most existing work built a binary prediction for each label independently,
ignoring the dependencies between labels. To address this problem, we propose a
two-stage framework to improve automatic ICD coding by capturing the label
correlation. Specifically, we train a label set distribution estimator to
rescore the probability of each label set candidate generated by a base
predictor. This paper is the first attempt at learning the label set
distribution as a reranking module for medical code prediction. In the
experiments, our proposed framework is able to improve upon best-performing
predictors on the benchmark MIMIC datasets. The source code of this project is
available at https://github.com/MiuLab/ICD-Correlation.</span>

Translation task. We participated with a direct model, which is a
Transformer-based architecture trained to translate English speech audio data
into German texts. The training pipeline is characterized by knowledge
distillation and a two-step fine-tuning procedure. Both knowledge distillation
and the first fine-tuning step are carried out on manually segmented real and
synthetic data, the latter being generated with an MT system trained on the
available corpora. Differently, the second fine-tuning step is carried out on a
random segmentation of the MuST-C v2 En-De dataset. Its main goal is to reduce
the performance drops occurring when a speech translation model trained on
manually segmented data (i.e. an ideal, sentence-like segmentation) is
evaluated on automatically segmented audio (i.e. actual, more realistic testing
conditions). For the same purpose, a custom hybrid segmentation procedure that
accounts for both audio content (pauses) and for the length of the produced
segments is applied to the test data before passing them to the system. At
inference time, we compared this procedure with a baseline segmentation method
based on Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Our results indicate the effectiveness
of the proposed hybrid approach, shown by a reduction of the gap with manual
segmentation from 8.3 to 1.4 BLEU points.</span>

                                        <span>Despite rapid developments in the field of machine learning research,
collecting high-quality labels for supervised learning remains a bottleneck for
many applications. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that
state-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,
often increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.
Weak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and
reduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for
supervision. However, until recently, data programming was only accessible to
users who knew how to program. To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by
Demonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of
labeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This
framework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models
for document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to
span-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP
labeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for
annotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and
encourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and
active learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could
achieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling
for different span-level annotation tasks.</span>

provide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become
inconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific
knowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,
we propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system
with novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the
classification performance of the system has been improved with three effective
techniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning
technique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural
network layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with
new data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to
overcome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the
first iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained
simultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the
training process with another two iterations and the training processes for
other BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system
has been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and
BERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic
Acceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform
better than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.</span>

designed for a learning task when annotated data is scarce, for example, in
depressive language detection from Tweets. We start with a rich word embedding
pre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with
embeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through
a simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other
more sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder
based and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding
representations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar
semantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations
better capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the
semantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the
general language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our
word embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known
sentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word
embedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine
learning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets
identification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations
achieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied
to a high quality dataset. Also, we present several data ablation tests which
confirm the efficacy of our augmentation techniques.</span>

romanized text into the native script of its language (for Russian, Arabic, and

issue, for which we exploit the natural language signals from the users&#x27; query
and the contextual knowledge from the products. In particular, we extract the
vector representations of ads via the Transformer model and leverage their
geometric relation to building collaborative bidding predictions via
clustering. The two-step procedure also significantly reduces the computation
stress of bid evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the
end-to-end structure of the bidding system for search engine marketing for
Walmart e-commerce, which successfully handles tens of millions of bids each
day. We analyze the online and offline performances of our approach and discuss
how we find it as a production-efficient solution.</span>

                                        <span>State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid
subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and
adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive
bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To
this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)
that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a
data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and
learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.
We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates
GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,
multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a
series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par
and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is
fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level
Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this
work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained
completely end-to-end.</span>

                                        <span>The clinical named entity recognition (CNER) task seeks to locate and
classify clinical terminologies into predefined categories, such as diagnostic
procedure, disease disorder, severity, medication, medication dosage, and sign
symptom. CNER facilitates the study of side-effect on medications including
identification of novel phenomena and human-focused information extraction.
Existing approaches in extracting the entities of interests focus on using
static word embeddings to represent each word. However, one word can have
different interpretations that depend on the context of the sentences.
Evidently, static word embeddings are insufficient to integrate the diverse
interpretation of a word. To overcome this challenge, the technique of
contextualized word embedding has been introduced to better capture the
semantic meaning of each word based on its context. Two of these language
models, ELMo and Flair, have been widely used in the field of Natural Language
Processing to generate the contextualized word embeddings on domain-generic
documents. However, these embeddings are usually too general to capture the
proximity among vocabularies of specific domains. To facilitate various
downstream applications using clinical case reports (CCRs), we pre-train two
deep contextualized language models, Clinical Embeddings from Language Model
(C-ELMo) and Clinical Contextual String Embeddings (C-Flair) using the
clinical-related corpus from the PubMed Central. Explicit experiments show that
our models gain dramatic improvements compared to both static word embeddings
and domain-generic language models.</span>

                                        <span>The self-attention-based model, transformer, is recently becoming the leading
backbone in the field of computer vision. In spite of the impressive success
made by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy
computation and intensive memory cost. To address this limitation, this paper
presents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$).
We start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on
uncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to
dynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework
is then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at
different stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage
of computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video
tasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4X speed-up for state-of-the-art
models like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy.
More importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is
inherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision
transformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being
lighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our
framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual
transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation
methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results. Project Page:

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

                                        <span>The assessment of laboratory animal behavior is of central interest in modern
neuroscience research. Behavior is typically studied in terms of pose changes,
which are ideally captured in three dimensions. This requires triangulation
over a multi-camera system which view the animal from different angles.
However, this is challenging in realistic laboratory setups due to occlusions
and other technical constrains. Here we propose the usage of lift-pose models
that allow for robust 3D pose estimation of freely moving rodents from a single
view camera view. To obtain high-quality training data for the pose-lifting, we
first perform geometric calibration in a camera setup involving bottom as well
as side views of the behaving animal. We then evaluate the performance of two
previously proposed model architectures under given inference perspectives and
conclude that reliable 3D pose inference can be obtained using temporal
convolutions. With this work we would like to contribute to a more robust and
diverse behavior tracking of freely moving rodents for a wide range of
experiments and setups in the neuroscience community.</span>

complex problems, the likes of which we could not have imagined a few decades
back. But as many benefits as it brings, there are still ways in which it can
be used to bring harm to our society. Deep fakes have been proven to be one
such problem, and now more than ever, when any individual can create a fake
image or video simply using an application on the smartphone, there need to be
some countermeasures, with which we can detect if the image or video is a fake
or real and dispose of the problem threatening the trustworthiness of online
information. Although the Deep fakes created by neural networks, may seem to be
as real as a real image or video, it still leaves behind spatial and temporal
traces or signatures after moderation, these signatures while being invisible
to a human eye can be detected with the help of a neural network trained to
specialize in Deep fake detection. In this paper, we analyze several such
states of the art neural networks (MesoNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and Xception
Net) and compare them against each other, to find an optimal solution for
various scenarios like real-time deep fake detection to be deployed in online
social media platforms where the classification should be made as fast as

object classification in photographs to adding sound to silent movies
everything can be performed with the help of deep learning and machine learning
algorithms. Likewise, Handwritten text recognition is one of the significant
areas of research and development with a streaming number of possibilities that
could be attained. Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as Handwritten
Text Recognition (HTR), is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret
intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents,
photographs, touch-screens and other devices [1]. Apparently, in this paper, we
have performed handwritten digit recognition with the help of MNIST datasets
using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models. Our main objective is to compare the
accuracy of the models stated above along with their execution time to get the

                                        <span>Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for
training monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results
on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised
methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are
common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:
abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for
images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more
generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel
Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction
error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in
untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured
areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show
that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without
any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.
Secondly, we show that training with an application&#x27;s representative rotations,
in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over
the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is
successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets
with no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of
self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Lane detection is an essential part of the perception sub-architecture of any
automated driving (AD) or advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). When
focusing on low-cost, large scale products for automated driving, model-driven
approaches for the detection of lane markings have proven good performance.
More recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed that target the
drivable area / freespace mainly in inner-city applications. Focus of these
approaches is less on lane-based driving due to the fact that the lane concept
does not fully apply in unstructured, residential inner-city environments.
So-far the concept of drivable area is seldom used for highway and inter-urban
applications due to the specific requirements of these scenarios that require
clear lane associations of all traffic participants. We believe that
lane-based, mapless driving in inter-urban and highway scenarios is still not
fully handled with sufficient robustness and availability. Especially for
challenging weather situations such as heavy rain, fog, low-standing sun,
darkness or reflections in puddles, the mapless detection of lane markings
decreases significantly or completely fails. We see potential in applying
specifically designed data-driven freespace approaches in more lane-based
driving applications for highways and inter-urban use. Therefore, we propose to
classify specifically a drivable corridor of the ego lane on pixel level with a
deep learning approach. Our approach is kept computationally efficient with
only 0.66 million parameters allowing its application in large scale products.
Thus, we were able to easily integrate into an online AD system of a test
vehicle. We demonstrate the performance of our approach under challenging
conditions qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to a state-of-the-art
model-driven approach.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate lighting estimation is challenging yet critical to many computer
vision and computer graphics tasks such as high-dynamic-range (HDR) relighting.
Existing approaches model lighting in either frequency domain or spatial domain
which is insufficient to represent the complex lighting conditions in scenes
and tends to produce inaccurate estimation. This paper presents NeedleLight, a
new lighting estimation model that represents illumination with needlets and
allows lighting estimation in both frequency domain and spatial domain jointly.
An optimal thresholding function is designed to achieve sparse needlets which
trims redundant lighting parameters and demonstrates superior localization
properties for illumination representation. In addition, a novel spherical
transport loss is designed based on optimal transport theory which guides to
regress lighting representation parameters with consideration of the spatial
information. Furthermore, we propose a new metric that is concise yet effective
by directly evaluating the estimated illumination maps rather than rendered
images. Extensive experiments show that NeedleLight achieves superior lighting
estimation consistently across multiple evaluation metrics as compared with
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning is a challenging task, which aims to learn a classifier for
novel classes with few examples. Pre-training based meta-learning methods
effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then
fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However,
results show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In
this paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature
space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes
spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the
feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature
extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during
meta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based
meta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge
(i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative
attribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to
learn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype
completion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we
further develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the
mean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.
Extensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate
prototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% - 9% in terms of
classification accuracy. Our code is available online.</span>

In this work, we present an extension of the CLIP model that handles audio in

AudioCLIP achieves new state-of-the-art results in the Environmental Sound

Further it sets new baselines in the zero-shot ESC-task on the same datasets

with growing application potentials. However, previous GAN-based methods are
not only confined to domain-specific, low-resolution data but also lacking in
interpretability. To overcome the collective difficulties, we develop a
text-to-operation model to map the vague editing language request into a series
of editing operations, e.g., change contrast, brightness, and saturation. Each
operation is interpretable and differentiable. Furthermore, the only
supervision in the task is the target image, which is insufficient for a stable
training of sequential decisions. Hence, we propose a novel operation planning
algorithm to generate possible editing sequences from the target image as
pseudo ground truth. Comparison experiments on the newly collected MA5k-Req

to the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to
overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning
process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method
that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve
both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we
maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both
the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI
loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is
invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to
computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous
feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster
assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a
local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder
and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require
a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a
final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the
cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four
challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation.
Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches
for semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full

                                        <span>Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the
movement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions
with semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale
video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D
human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body
motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we
present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions
being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about
43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of
abstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and
frame labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame
label is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the
mocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence
labels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action
categories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action
recognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To
demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of
models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting
learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve
as a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,
baseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for
academic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.</span>

task. Prior research has mainly focused to enhance the quality of generation by
investigating the use of spatial attention and/or textual attention thereby
neglecting the relationship between channels. In this work, we propose the
Combined Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN) to generate
photo-realistic images according to textual descriptions. The proposed CAGAN
utilises two attention models: word attention to draw different sub-regions
conditioned on related words; and squeeze-and-excitation attention to capture
non-linear interaction among channels. With spectral normalisation to stabilise
training, our proposed CAGAN improves the state of the art on the IS and FID on
the CUB dataset and the FID on the more challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be
misleading by developing an additional model adding local self-attention which
scores a higher IS, outperforming the state of the art on the CUB dataset, but
generates unrealistic images through feature repetition.</span>

                                        <span>This paper introduces EfficientNetV2, a new family of convolutional networks
that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous
models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of
training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize
training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the
search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show
that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while
being up to 6.8x smaller.

Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image
size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for
this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g.,
dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast
training and good accuracy.

With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms
previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on
the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while
training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources. Code will be

                                        <span>Nowadays, vision-based computing tasks play an important role in various
real-world applications. However, many vision computing tasks, e.g. semantic
segmentation, are usually computationally expensive, posing a challenge to the
computing systems that are resource-constrained but require fast response
speed. Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision
processing models that only require limited computational resources. To this
end, we propose the Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation Network (SGCPNet)
for achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the
strategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial
details of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global
contexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively
reconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features
along the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency.
On the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the
segmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SGCPNet model. On the
Citysacpes dataset, for example, our SGCPNet achieves 69.5 % mIoU segmentation
accuracy, while its speed reaches 178.5 FPS on 768x1536 images on a GeForce GTX
1080 Ti GPU card.</span>

prominently over-confidence in erroneous predictions. Such behaviours will have
disastrous effects on real-world machine learning systems. In this field
graceful degradation refers to the optimisation of model performance as it
encounters this out-of-distribution data. This work presents a definition and
discussion of graceful degradation and where it can be applied in deployed
visual systems. Following this a survey of relevant areas is undertaken,
novelly splitting the graceful degradation problem into active and passive
approaches. In passive approaches, graceful degradation is handled and achieved
by the model in a self-contained manner, in active approaches the model is
updated upon encountering epistemic uncertainties. This work communicates the
importance of the problem and aims to prompt the development of machine
learning strategies that are aware of graceful degradation.</span>

comprehensive visual understanding of machines. While detecting non-temporal
HOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely
even for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)
from a single video frame, where the neighboring frames play an essential role.
However, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been
used to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing
without temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal
information. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common
action detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a
feature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective
architecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal
information such as human and object trajectories, correctly-localized visual
features, and spatial-temporal masking pose features. We construct a new video
HOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid
baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical imaging. Due
to the large computational complexity of deformable registration of volumetric
images, conventional iterative methods usually face the tradeoff between the
registration accuracy and the computation time in practice. In order to boost
the registration performance in both accuracy and runtime, we propose a fast
convolutional neural network. Specially, to efficiently utilize the memory
resources and enlarge the model capacity, we adopt additive forwarding instead
of channel concatenation and deepen the network in each encoder and decoder
stage. To facilitate the learning efficiency, we leverage skip connection
within the encoder and decoder stages to enable residual learning and employ an
auxiliary loss at the bottom layer with lowest resolution to involve deep
supervision. Particularly, the low-resolution auxiliary loss is weighted by an
exponentially decayed parameter during the training phase. In conjunction with
the main loss in high-resolution grid, a coarse-to-fine learning strategy is
achieved. Last but not least, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on the
segmentation prior to improve the registration performance in Dice score.
Comparing to the auxiliary loss using average Dice score, the proposed
multi-label segmentation loss does not induce additional memory cost in the
training phase and can be employed on images with arbitrary amount of
categories. In the experiments, we show FDRN outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art registration methods for brain MR images by resorting to the
compact network structure and efficient learning. Besides, FDRN is a
generalized framework for image registration which is not confined to a
particular type of medical images or anatomy.</span>

to understand human activities from a video is a challenging task due to
various problems including background, camera motion and dataset variations.
This paper proposes two CNN based architectures with three streams which allow
the model to exploit the dataset under different settings. The three pathways
are differentiated in frame rates. The single pathway, operates at a single
frame rate captures spatial information, the slow pathway operates at low frame
rates captures the spatial information and the fast pathway operates at high
frame rates that capture fine temporal information. Post CNN encoders, we add
bidirectional LSTM and attention heads respectively to capture the context and

                                        <span>Attentional mechanisms are order-invariant. Positional encoding is a crucial
component to allow attention-based deep model architectures such as Transformer
to address sequences or images where the position of information matters. In
this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding method based on learnable
Fourier features. Instead of hard-coding each position as a token or a vector,
we represent each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable
encoding based on learnable Fourier feature mapping, modulated with a
multi-layer perceptron. The representation is particularly advantageous for a
spatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where
$L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured.
Our experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable
Fourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding
outperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster
convergence.</span>

classification tasks, PocketNet architectures produce results comparable to
that of conventional neural networks while reducing the number of parameters by
multiple orders of magnitude, using up to 90% less GPU memory, and speeding up

Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy
on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on
Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and
temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of
locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy
trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally
even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video
architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the
image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image
models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of
video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1
accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20x less
pre-training data and ~3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1
accuracy on Something-Something v2). The code and models will be made publicly

FedFace utilizes the face images available on multiple clients to learn an
accurate and generalizable face recognition model where the face images stored
at each client are neither shared with other clients nor the central host and
each client is a mobile device containing face images pertaining to only the
owner of the device (one identity per client). Our experiments show the

                                        <span>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with
unprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle
dynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is
through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each
input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these
deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as
topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these
deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by
lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D
radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through
this &quot;hyper-space&quot;. Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model
the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We
evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between &quot;moments&quot;,
i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining
visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show
that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both
tasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average
error rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as
measured by LPIPS.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have developed to become powerful models
for various computer vision tasks ranging from object detection to semantic
segmentation. However, most of state-of-the-art CNNs can not be deployed
directly on edge devices such as smartphones and drones, which need low latency
under limited power and memory bandwidth. One popular, straightforward approach
to compressing CNNs is network slimming, which imposes $\ell_1$ regularization
on the channel-associated scaling factors via the batch normalization layers
during training. Network slimming thereby identifies insignificant channels
that can be pruned for inference. In this paper, we propose replacing the
$\ell_1$ penalty with an alternative sparse, nonconvex penalty in order to
yield a more compressed and/or accurate CNN architecture. We investigate
$\ell_p (0 &lt; p &lt; 1)$, transformed $\ell_1$ (T$\ell_1$), minimax concave penalty
(MCP), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) due to their recent
successes and popularity in solving sparse optimization problems, such as
compressed sensing and variable selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
network slimming with nonconvex penalties on VGGNet, Densenet, and Resnet on
standard image classification datasets. Based on the numerical experiments,
T$\ell_1$ preserves model accuracy against channel pruning, $\ell_{1/2, 3/4}$
yield better compressed models with similar accuracies after retraining as
$\ell_1$, and MCP and SCAD provide more accurate models after retraining with
similar compression as $\ell_1$. Network slimming with T$\ell_1$ regularization
also outperforms the latest Bayesian modification of network slimming in
compressing a CNN architecture in terms of memory storage while preserving its
model accuracy after channel pruning.</span>

videos by language queries, but it faces the challenge of two types of
inevitable human uncertainties: query uncertainty and label uncertainty. The
two uncertainties stem from human subjectivity, leading to limited
generalization ability of temporal grounding. In this work, we propose a novel
DeNet (Decoupling and De-bias) to embrace human uncertainty: Decoupling - We
explicitly disentangle each query into a relation feature and a modified
feature. The relation feature, which is mainly based on skeleton-like words
(including nouns and verbs), aims to extract basic and consistent information
in the presence of query uncertainty. Meanwhile, modified feature assigned with
style-like words (including adjectives, adverbs, etc) represents the subjective
information, and thus brings personalized predictions; De-bias - We propose a
de-bias mechanism to generate diverse predictions, aim to alleviate the bias
caused by single-style annotations in the presence of label uncertainty.
Moreover, we put forward new multi-label metrics to diversify the performance
evaluation. Extensive experiments show that our approach is more effective and
robust than state-of-the-arts on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions

inference can be reduced by pruning weights from the trained network. Pruning
is guided by a pruning saliency, which heuristically approximates the change in
the loss function associated with the removal of specific weights. Many pruning
signals have been proposed, but the performance of each heuristic depends on
the particular trained network. This leaves the data scientist with a difficult
choice. When using any one saliency metric for the entire pruning process, we
run the risk of the metric assumptions being invalidated, leading to poor
decisions being made by the metric. Ideally we could combine the best aspects
of different saliency metrics. However, despite an extensive literature review,
we are unable to find any prior work on composing different saliency metrics.
The chief difficulty lies in combining the numerical output of different
saliency metrics, which are not directly comparable.

We propose a method to compose several primitive pruning saliencies, to
exploit the cases where each saliency measure does well. Our experiments show
that the composition of saliencies avoids many poor pruning choices identified
by individual saliencies. In most cases our method finds better selections than
even the best individual pruning saliency.</span>

                                        <span>Explaining the decisions of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model is
increasingly critical in many real-world, high-stake applications. Hundreds of
papers have either proposed new feature attribution methods, discussed or
harnessed these tools in their work. However, despite humans being the target
end-users, most attribution methods were only evaluated on proxy
automatic-evaluation metrics. In this paper, we conduct the first, large-scale
user study on 320 lay and 11 expert users to shed light on the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art attribution methods in assisting humans in ImageNet
classification, Stanford Dogs fine-grained classification, and these two tasks
but when the input image contains adversarial perturbations. We found that, in
overall, feature attribution is surprisingly not more effective than showing
humans nearest training-set examples. On a hard task of fine-grained dog
categorization, presenting attribution maps to humans does not help, but
instead hurts the performance of human-AI teams compared to AI alone.
Importantly, we found automatic attribution-map evaluation measures to
correlate poorly with the actual human-AI team performance. Our findings
encourage the community to rigorously test their methods on the downstream
human-in-the-loop applications and to rethink the existing evaluation metrics.</span>

recent baselines sometimes struggle to reconstruct coherent 3D spaces in this

demonstrate object insertion with interactive posing. With our work, we help
move towards structured representations that handle more real-world variation

variety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore,
such an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world
and therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual
perception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video,
conditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting
task which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.
Existing video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow
benchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with
more complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of
evidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes
for the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient
use of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for
underfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which
is capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar
parameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the
consequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected
outcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data,
and how it can be mitigated using existing image augmentation techniques. As a
result, FitVid outperforms the current state-of-the-art models across four
different video prediction benchmarks on four different metrics.</span>

                                        <span>The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is a powerful statistical tool for representing
3D face shapes. To build a 3DMM, a training set of face scans in full
point-to-point correspondence is required, and its modeling capabilities
directly depend on the variability contained in the training data. Thus, to
increase the descriptive power of the 3DMM, establishing a dense correspondence
across heterogeneous scans with sufficient diversity in terms of identities,
ethnicities, or expressions becomes essential. In this manuscript, we present a
fully automatic approach that leverages a 3DMM to transfer its dense semantic
annotation across raw 3D faces, establishing a dense correspondence between
them. We propose a novel formulation to learn a set of sparse deformation
components with local support on the face that, together with an original
non-rigid deformation algorithm, allow the 3DMM to precisely fit unseen faces
and transfer its semantic annotation. We extensively experimented our approach,
showing it can effectively generalize to highly diverse samples and accurately
establish a dense correspondence even in presence of complex facial
expressions. The accuracy of the dense registration is demonstrated by building
a heterogeneous, large-scale 3DMM from more than 9,000 fully registered scans
obtained by joining three large datasets together.</span>

                                        <span>Face recognition systems are extremely vulnerable to morphing attacks, in
which a morphed facial reference image can be successfully verified as two or
more distinct identities. In this paper, we propose a morph attack detection
algorithm that leverages an undecimated 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for
identifying morphed face images. The core of our framework is that artifacts
resulting from the morphing process that are not discernible in the image
domain can be more easily identified in the spatial frequency domain. A
discriminative wavelet sub-band can accentuate the disparity between a real and
a morphed image. To this end, multi-level DWT is applied to all images,
yielding 48 mid and high-frequency sub-bands each. The entropy distributions
for each sub-band are calculated separately for both bona fide and morph
images. For some of the sub-bands, there is a marked difference between the
entropy of the sub-band in a bona fide image and the identical sub-band&#x27;s
entropy in a morphed image. Consequently, we employ Kullback-Liebler Divergence
(KLD) to exploit these differences and isolate the sub-bands that are the most
discriminative. We measure how discriminative a sub-band is by its KLD value
and the 22 sub-bands with the highest KLD values are chosen for network
training. Then, we train a deep Siamese neural network using these 22 selected
sub-bands for differential morph attack detection. We examine the efficacy of
discriminative wavelet sub-bands for morph attack detection and show that a
deep neural network trained on these sub-bands can accurately identify morph
imagery.</span>

entire classes of 3D shapes with large intra-class variations. ShapeFlow allows
learning a multi-template deformation space that is agnostic to shape topology,
yet preserves fine geometric details. Different from a generative space where a
latent vector is directly decoded into a shape, a deformation space decodes a
vector into a continuous flow that can advect a source shape towards a target.
Such a space naturally allows the disentanglement of geometric style (coming
from the source) and structural pose (conforming to the target). We parametrize
the deformation between geometries as a learned continuous flow field via a
neural network and show that such deformations can be guaranteed to have
desirable properties, such as be bijectivity, freedom from self-intersections,
or volume preservation. We illustrate the effectiveness of this learned
deformation space for various downstream applications, including shape
generation via deformation, geometric style transfer, unsupervised learning of
a consistent parameterization for entire classes of shapes, and shape
interpolation.</span>

$k$-means method is a popular, efficient, and distribution-free approach for
clustering numerical-valued data, but does not apply for categorical-valued
observations. The $k$-modes method addresses this lacuna by replacing the
Euclidean with the Hamming distance and the means with the modes in the
$k$-means objective function. We provide a novel, computationally efficient
implementation of $k$-modes, called OTQT. We prove that OTQT finds updates to
improve the objective function that are undetectable to existing $k$-modes
algorithms. Although slightly slower per iteration due to algorithmic
complexity, OTQT is always more accurate per iteration and almost always faster
(and only barely slower on some datasets) to the final optimum. Thus, we
recommend OTQT as the preferred, default algorithm for $k$-modes optimization.</span>

Recently, deep learning has achieved breakthrough performance in many image

Review, we survey recent advances in using deep learning to enhance performance
of super-resolution microscopy. We focus primarily on how deep learning
ad-vances reconstruction of super-resolution images. Related key technical

military target detection, environmental monitoring, hazard prevention and
other time-critical applications require onboard real time processing
capabilities or autonomous decision making. Some unmanned remote systems like
satellites are physically remote from their operators, and all control of the
spacecraft and data returned by the spacecraft must be transmitted over a
wireless radio link. This link may not be available for extended periods when
the satellite is out of line of sight of its ground station. Therefore,
lightweight, small size and low power consumption hardware is essential for
onboard real time processing systems. With increasing dimensionality, size and
resolution of recent hyperspectral imaging sensors, additional challenges are
posed upon remote sensing processing systems and more capable computing
architectures are needed. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) emerged as
promising architecture for light weight high performance computing that can
address these computational requirements for onboard systems. The goal of this
study is to build high performance methods for onboard hyperspectral analysis.
We propose accelerated methods for the well-known recursive hierarchical
segmentation (RHSEG) clustering method, using GPUs, hybrid multicore CPU with a
GPU and hybrid multi-core CPU/GPU clusters. RHSEG is a method developed by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which is designed to
provide rich classification information with several output levels. The
achieved speedups by parallel solutions compared to CPU sequential
implementations are 21x for parallel single GPU and 240x for hybrid multi-node
computer clusters with 16 computing nodes. The energy consumption is reduced to
74% using a single GPU compared to the equivalent parallel CPU cluster.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative learning, which enables collaborative and decentralized
training of deep neural networks at multiple institutions in a
privacy-preserving manner, is rapidly emerging as a valuable technique in
healthcare applications. However, its distributed nature often leads to
significant heterogeneity in data distributions across institutions. Existing
collaborative learning approaches generally do not account for the presence of
heterogeneity in data among institutions, or only mildly skewed label
distributions are studied. In this paper, we present a novel generative replay
strategy to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in collaborative
learning methods. Instead of directly training a model for task performance, we
leverage recent image synthesis techniques to develop a novel dual model
architecture: a primary model learns the desired task, and an auxiliary
&quot;generative replay model&quot; either synthesizes images that closely resemble the
input images or helps extract latent variables. The generative replay strategy
is flexible to use, can either be incorporated into existing collaborative
learning methods to improve their capability of handling data heterogeneity
across institutions, or be used as a novel and individual collaborative
learning framework (termed FedReplay) to reduce communication cost.
Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in
handling heterogeneous data across institutions. On highly heterogeneous data
partitions, our model achieves ~4.88% improvement in the prediction accuracy on
a diabetic retinopathy classification dataset, and ~49.8% reduction of mean
absolution value on a Bone Age prediction dataset, respectively, compared to
the state-of-the art collaborative learning methods.</span>

                                        <span>Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding
in the environment, which is challenging due to the similar appearance of
camouflaged objects and their surroundings. Research in biology suggests that
depth can provide useful object localization cues for camouflaged object
discovery, as all the animals have 3D perception ability. However, the depth
information has not been exploited for camouflaged object detection. To explore
the contribution of depth for camouflage detection, we present a depth-guided
camouflaged object detection network with pre-computed depth maps from existing
monocular depth estimation methods. Due to the domain gap between the depth
estimation dataset and our camouflaged object detection dataset, the generated
depth may not be accurate enough to be directly used in our framework. We then
introduce a depth quality assessment module to evaluate the quality of depth
based on the model prediction from both RGB COD branch and RGB-D COD branch.
During training, only high-quality depth is used to update the modal
interaction module for multi-modal learning. During testing, our depth quality
assessment module can effectively determine the contribution of depth and
select the RGB branch or RGB-D branch for camouflage prediction. Extensive
experiments on various camouflaged object detection datasets prove the
effectiveness of our solution in exploring the depth information for
camouflaged object detection. Our code and data is publicly available at:

fatalities, developing intelligent driving systems assisting drivers to
identify potential risks is in urgent need. Risky situations are generally
defined based on collision prediction in existing research. However, collisions
are only one type of risk in traffic scenarios. We believe a more generic
definition is required. In this work, we propose a novel driver-centric
definition of risk, i.e., risky objects influence driver behavior. Based on
this definition, a new task called risk object identification is introduced. We
formulate the task as a cause-effect problem and present a novel two-stage risk
object identification framework, taking inspiration from models of situation
awareness and causal inference. A driver-centric Risk Object Identification
(ROI) dataset is curated to evaluate the proposed system. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art risk object identification performance compared with strong
baselines on the ROI dataset. In addition, we conduct extensive ablative

                                        <span>Dealing with incomplete information is a well studied problem in the context
of machine learning and computational intelligence. However, in the context of
computer vision, the problem has only been studied in specific scenarios (e.g.,
certain types of occlusions in specific types of images), although it is common
to have incomplete information in visual data. This chapter describes the
design of an academic competition focusing on inpainting of images and video
sequences that was part of the competition program of WCCI2018 and had a
satellite event collocated with ECCV2018. The ChaLearn Looking at People
Inpainting Challenge aimed at advancing the state of the art on visual
inpainting by promoting the development of methods for recovering missing and
occluded information from images and video. Three tracks were proposed in which
visual inpainting might be helpful but still challenging: human body pose
estimation, text overlays removal and fingerprint denoising. This chapter
describes the design of the challenge, which includes the release of three
novel datasets, and the description of evaluation metrics, baselines and
evaluation protocol. The results of the challenge are analyzed and discussed in
detail and conclusions derived from this event are outlined.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, vision transformers and MLP-based models have been developed in
order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural
networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along
with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these
architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data
augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we
propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption
robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more
robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that
vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more
shape bias. Our code is available to reproduce.</span>

                                        <span>Neural network-based semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable results
when large amounts of annotated data are available, that is, in the supervised
case. However, such data is expensive to collect and so methods have been
developed to adapt models trained on related, often synthetic data for which
labels are readily available. Current adaptation approaches do not consider the
dependence of the generalization/transferability of these models on network
architecture. In this paper, we perform neural architecture search (NAS) to
provide architecture-level perspective and analysis for domain adaptation. We
identify the optimization gap that exists when searching architectures for
unsupervised domain adaptation which makes this NAS problem uniquely difficult.
We propose bridging this gap by using maximum mean discrepancy and regional
weighted entropy to estimate the accuracy metric. Experimental results on
several widely adopted benchmarks show that our proposed AutoAdapt framework
indeed discovers architectures that improve the performance of a number of
existing adaptation techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Moving target detection plays an important role in computer vision. However,
traditional algorithms such as frame difference and optical flow usually suffer
from low accuracy or heavy computation. Recent algorithms such as deep
learning-based convolutional neural networks have achieved high accuracy and
real-time performance, but they usually need to know the classes of targets in
advance, which limits the practical applications. Therefore, we proposed a
model free moving target detection algorithm. This algorithm extracts the
moving area through the difference of image features. Then, the color and
location probability map of the moving area will be calculated through maximum
a posteriori probability. And the target probability map can be obtained
through the dot multiply between the two maps. Finally, the optimal moving
target area can be solved by stochastic gradient descent on the target
probability map. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest
accuracy compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, without needing to know the
classes of targets. Furthermore, as the existing datasets are not suitable for
moving target detection, we proposed a method for producing evaluation dataset.
Besides, we also proved the proposed algorithm can be used to assist target
tracking.</span>

                                        <span>Current deep learning approaches for diffusion MRI modeling circumvent the
need for densely-sampled diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) by directly
predicting microstructural indices from sparsely-sampled DWIs. However, they
implicitly make unrealistic assumptions of static $q$-space sampling during
training and reconstruction. Further, such approaches can restrict downstream
usage of variably sampled DWIs for usages including the estimation of
microstructural indices or tractography. We propose a generative adversarial
translation framework for high-quality DWI synthesis with arbitrary $q$-space
sampling given commonly acquired structural images (e.g., B0, T1, T2). Our
translation network linearly modulates its internal representations conditioned
on continuous $q$-space information, thus removing the need for fixed sampling
schemes. Moreover, this approach enables downstream estimation of high-quality
microstructural maps from arbitrarily subsampled DWIs, which may be
particularly important in cases with sparsely sampled DWIs. Across several
recent methodologies, the proposed approach yields improved DWI synthesis
accuracy and fidelity with enhanced downstream utility as quantified by the
accuracy of scalar microstructure indices estimated from the synthesized
images. Code is available at

action category. Limited by GPU memory, mainstream methods pre-extract features
for each video. Therefore, feature quality determines the upper bound of
detection performance. In this technical report, we explored classic
convolution-based backbones and the recent surge of transformer-based
backbones. We found that the transformer-based methods can achieve better
classification performance than convolution-based, but they cannot generate
accuracy action proposals. In addition, extracting features with larger frame
resolution to reduce the loss of spatial information can also effectively
improve the performance of temporal action localization. Finally, we achieve
42.42% in terms of mAP on validation set with a single SlowFast feature by a
simple combination: BMN+TCANet, which is 1.87% higher than the result of 2020&#x27;s

multi-view approach addresses the problem that view synthesis methods are often
limited by their depth estimation stage, where incorrect depth predictions can
lead to large projection errors. To avoid this issue, we efficiently warp
multiple input images into the target frame for a range of assumed depth
planes. The resulting tensor representation is fed into a U-Net-like CNN with
gated convolutions, which directly produces the novel output view. We therefore
side-step explicit depth estimation. This improves efficiency and performance
on transparent, reflective, and feature-less scene parts. FaDIV-Syn can handle
both interpolation and extrapolation tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art
extrapolation methods on the large-scale RealEstate10k dataset. In contrast to
comparable methods, it is capable of real-time operation due to its lightweight
architecture. We further demonstrate data efficiency of FaDIV-Syn by training
from fewer examples as well as its generalization to higher resolutions and
arbitrary depth ranges under severe depth discretization.</span>

Autoencoders (SWAEs). We propose to symmetrically match the joint distributions
of the observed data and the latent representation induced by the encoder and
the decoder. The resulting algorithm jointly optimizes the modelling losses in
both the data and the latent spaces with the loss in the data space leading to
the denoising effect. With the symmetric treatment of the data and the latent
representation, the algorithm implicitly preserves the local structure of the
data in the latent space. To further improve the quality of the latent
representation, we incorporate a reconstruction loss into the objective, which
significantly benefits both the generation and reconstruction. We empirically
show the superior performance of SWAEs over the state-of-the-art generative
autoencoders in terms of classification, reconstruction, and generation.</span>

                                        <span>Visual recognition has been dominated by convolutionalneural networks (CNNs)
for years. Though recently the pre-vailing vision transformers (ViTs) have
shown great poten-tial of self-attention based models in ImageNet
classifica-tion, their performance is still inferior to latest SOTA CNNsif no
extra data are provided. In this work, we aim to closethe performance gap and
demonstrate that attention-basedmodels are indeed able to outperform CNNs. We
found thatthe main factor limiting the performance of ViTs for Ima-geNet
classification is their low efficacy in encoding fine-level features into the
token representations. To resolvethis, we introduce a noveloutlook attentionand
present asimple and general architecture, termed Vision Outlooker(VOLO). Unlike
self-attention that focuses on global depen-dency modeling at a coarse level,
the outlook attention aimsto efficiently encode finer-level features and
contexts intotokens, which are shown to be critical for recognition
per-formance but largely ignored by the self-attention. Experi-ments show that
our VOLO achieves 87.1% top-1 accuracyon ImageNet-1K classification, being the
first model exceed-ing 87% accuracy on this competitive benchmark, withoutusing
any extra training data. In addition, the pre-trainedVOLO transfers well to
downstream tasks, such as seman-tic segmentation. We achieve 84.3% mIoU score
on thecityscapes validation set and 54.3% on the ADE20K valida-tion set. Code

black-boxes hindering user trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Research on opening black-box DNN can be broadly categorized into post-hoc
methods and inherently interpretable DNNs. While many surveys have been
conducted on post-hoc interpretation methods, little effort is devoted to
inherently interpretable DNNs. This paper provides a review of existing methods
to develop DNNs with intrinsic interpretability, with a focus on Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The aim is to understand the current progress towards
fully interpretable DNNs that can cater to different interpretation

                                        <span>The ability to estimate how a tumor might evolve in the future could have
tremendous clinical benefits, from improved treatment decisions to better dose
distribution in radiation therapy. Recent work has approached the glioma growth
modeling problem via deep learning and variational inference, thus learning
growth dynamics entirely from a real patient data distribution. So far, this
approach was constrained to predefined image acquisition intervals and
sequences of fixed length, which limits its applicability in more realistic
scenarios. We overcome these limitations by extending Neural Processes, a class
of conditional generative models for stochastic time series, with a
hierarchical multi-scale representation encoding including a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. The result is a learned growth model that can be
conditioned on an arbitrary number of observations, and that can produce a
distribution of temporally consistent growth trajectories on a continuous time
axis. On a dataset of 379 patients, the approach successfully captures both
global and finer-grained variations in the images, exhibiting superior
performance compared to other learned growth models.</span>

                                        <span>Depth completion aims to generate a dense depth map from the sparse depth map
and aligned RGB image. However, current depth completion methods use extremely
expensive 64-line LiDAR(about $100,000) to obtain sparse depth maps, which will
limit their application scenarios. Compared with the 64-line LiDAR, the
single-line LiDAR is much less expensive and much more robust. Therefore, we
propose a method to tackle the problem of single-line depth completion, in
which we aim to generate a dense depth map from the single-line LiDAR info and
the aligned RGB image. A single-line depth completion dataset is proposed based
on the existing 64-line depth completion dataset(KITTI). A network called
Semantic Guided Two-Branch Network(SGTBN) which contains global and local
branches to extract and fuse global and local info is proposed for this task. A
Semantic guided depth upsampling module is used in our network to make full use
of the semantic info in RGB images. Except for the usual MSE loss, we add the
virtual normal loss to increase the constraint of high-order 3D geometry in our
network. Our network outperforms the state-of-the-art in the single-line depth
completion task. Besides, compared with the monocular depth estimation, our
method also has significant advantages in precision and model size.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning
approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data
collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to
impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing
various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These
assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to
non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or
bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose
aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip
aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and
depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the
ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth
texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),
we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real
image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise
a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,
bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into
other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in
shallow DoF rendering.</span>

                                        <span>Existing scene text removal methods mainly train an elaborate network with
paired images to realize the function of text localization and background
reconstruction simultaneously, but there exists two problems: 1) lacking the
exhaustive erasure of text region and 2) causing the excessive erasure to
text-free areas. To handle these issues, this paper provides a novel
ProgrEssively Region-based scene Text eraser (PERT), which introduces
region-based modification strategy to progressively erase the pixels in only
text region. Firstly, PERT decomposes the STR task to several erasing stages.
As each stage aims to take a further step toward the text-removed image rather
than directly regress to the final result, the decomposed operation reduces the
learning difficulty in each stage, and an exhaustive erasure result can be
obtained by iterating over lightweight erasing blocks with shared parameters.
Then, PERT introduces a region-based modification strategy to ensure the
integrity of text-free areas by decoupling text localization from erasure
process to guide the removal. Benefiting from the simplicity architecture, PERT
is a simple and strong baseline, and is easy to be followed and developed.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PERT obtains the state-of-the-art
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Code is available

                                        <span>Visual Information Extraction (VIE) task aims to extract key information from
multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most
previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or
classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind
of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout.
But simply introducing multimodal features couldn&#x27;t work well when faced with
numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in
this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural
network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy
evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various
semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities.
Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the
instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can
significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our
knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling
the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the
existing methods.</span>

computer graphics images. However, these algorithms need to sample a
substantial amount of rays per pixel to enable proper global illumination and
thus require an immense amount of computation. In this paper, we present a
hybrid rendering method to speed up Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. Our
method first generates two versions of a rendering: one at a low resolution
with a high sample rate (LRHS) and the other at a high resolution with a low
sample rate (HRLS). We then develop a deep convolutional neural network to fuse
these two renderings into a high-quality image as if it were rendered at a high
resolution with a high sample rate. Specifically, we formulate this fusion task
as a super resolution problem that generates a high resolution rendering from a
low resolution input (LRHS), assisted with the HRLS rendering. The HRLS
rendering provides critical high frequency details which are difficult to
recover from the LRHS for any super resolution methods. Our experiments show
that our hybrid rendering algorithm is significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo denoising methods while rendering high-quality
images when tested on both our own BCR dataset and the Gharbi dataset.

                                        <span>Person re-identification (reID) plays an important role in computer vision.
However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation in occluded
scenes. In this work, we propose an occlusion-robust block, Region Feature
Completion (RFC), for occluded reID. Different from most previous works that
discard the occluded regions, RFC block can recover the semantics of occluded
regions in feature space. Firstly, a Spatial RFC (SRFC) module is developed.
SRFC exploits the long-range spatial contexts from non-occluded regions to
predict the features of occluded regions. The unit-wise prediction task leads
to an encoder/decoder architecture, where the region-encoder models the
correlation between non-occluded and occluded region, and the region-decoder
utilizes the spatial correlation to recover occluded region features. Secondly,
we introduce Temporal RFC (TRFC) module which captures the long-term temporal
contexts to refine the prediction of SRFC. RFC block is lightweight, end-to-end
trainable and can be easily plugged into existing CNNs to form RFCnet.
Extensive experiments are conducted on occluded and commonly holistic reID
benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods on the
occlusion datasets, while remains top even superior performance on holistic
datasets. The source code is available at

on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) can discriminate benign and malignant
pulmonary nodules. The LIDC-IDRI dataset, one of the largest publicly available
CT database, was exploited for study. A total of 1556 nodules from 694 patients
were involved in statistical analysis, where nodules with average scorings 3 were respectively denoted as benign and malignant. Besides, 339 nodules
from 113 patients with diagnosis ground-truth were independently evaluated.
Computer algorithms were developed to segment pulmonary structures and quantify
the distances to pleural surface, airways and vessels, as well as the counting
number and normalized volume of airways and vessels near a nodule. Odds ratio
(OR) and Chi-square (\chi^2) testing were performed to demonstrate the
correlation between features of surrounding structures and nodule malignancy. A
non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted
in logistic regression to evaluate discrimination ability of each structure.
For benign and malignant groups, the average distances from nodules to pleural
surface, airways and vessels are respectively (6.56, 5.19), (37.08, 26.43) and
(1.42, 1.07) mm. The correlation between nodules and the counting number of
airways and vessels that contact or project towards nodules are respectively
(OR&#x3D;22.96, \chi^2&#x3D;105.04) and (OR&#x3D;7.06, \chi^2&#x3D;290.11). The correlation between
nodules and the volume of airways and vessels are (OR&#x3D;9.19, \chi^2&#x3D;159.02) and
(OR&#x3D;2.29, \chi^2&#x3D;55.89). The areas-under-curves (AUCs) for pleurae, airways and
vessels are respectively 0.5202, 0.6943 and 0.6529. Our results show that
malignant nodules are often surrounded by more pulmonary structures compared
with benign ones, suggesting that features of these structures could be viewed
as lung cancer biomarkers.</span>

in order to remove blocking artifacts. With the development of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), CNNs have been explored for in-loop filtering
considering it can be treated as an image de-noising task. However, in addition
to being a distorted image, the reconstructed frame is also obtained by a fixed
line of block based encoding operations in video coding. It carries coding-unit
based coding distortion of some similar characteristics. Therefore, in this
paper, we address the filtering problem from two aspects, global appearance
restoration for disrupted texture and local coding distortion restoration
caused by fixed pipeline of coding. Accordingly, a three-stream global
appearance and local coding distortion based fusion network is developed with a
high-level global feature stream, a high-level local feature stream and a
low-level local feature stream. Ablation study is conducted to validate the
necessity of different features, demonstrating that the global features and
local features can complement each other in filtering and achieve better
performance when combined. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one
that clearly characterizes the video filtering process from the above global
appearance and local coding distortion restoration aspects with experimental
verification, providing a clear pathway to developing filter techniques.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the existing single-frame based methods and achieves 13.5%, 11.3%,
11.7% BD-Rate saving on average for AI, LDP and RA configurations,
respectively, compared with the HEVC reference software.</span>

language videos solely from speech segments for the first time. Recent efforts
in this space have focused on generating such videos from human-annotated text
transcripts without considering other modalities. However, replacing speech
with sign language proves to be a practical solution while communicating with
people suffering from hearing loss. Therefore, we eliminate the need of using
text as input and design techniques that work for more natural, continuous,
freely uttered speech covering an extensive vocabulary. Since the current
datasets are inadequate for generating sign language directly from speech, we
collect and release the first Indian sign language dataset comprising
speech-level annotations, text transcripts, and the corresponding sign-language
videos. Next, we propose a multi-tasking transformer network trained to
generate signer&#x27;s poses from speech segments. With speech-to-text as an
auxiliary task and an additional cross-modal discriminator, our model learns to
generate continuous sign pose sequences in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments and comparisons with other baselines demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. We also conduct additional ablation studies to analyze the

                                        <span>High-resolution image segmentation remains challenging and error-prone due to
the enormous size of intermediate feature maps. Conventional methods avoid this
problem by using patch based approaches where each patch is segmented
independently. However, independent patch segmentation induces errors,
particularly at the patch boundary due to the lack of contextual information in
very high-resolution images where the patch size is much smaller compared to
the full image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a
novel framework to segment a particular patch by incorporating contextual
information from its neighboring patches. This allows the segmentation network
to see the target patch with a wider field of view without the need of larger
feature maps. Comparative analysis from a number of experiments shows that our
proposed framework is able to segment high resolution images with significantly
improved mean Intersection over Union and overall accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Radiographs are used as the most important imaging tool for identifying spine
anomalies in clinical practice. The evaluation of spinal bone lesions, however,
is a challenging task for radiologists. This work aims at developing and
evaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the
classification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we
build a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies,
each of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding
boxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then
train a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal
and a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The
VinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies,
which is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%,
90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision
(mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task. These results serve
as a proof of concept and set a baseline for future research in this direction.
To encourage advances, the dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models are
made publicly available.</span>

frames to generate a higher-resolution image for each frame. However, the
redundant information between distant frames has not been fully exploited in
these methods: corresponding patches of the same instance appear across distant
frames at different scales. Based on this observation, we propose a video
super-resolution method with long-term cross-scale aggregation that leverages
similar patches (self-exemplars) across distant frames. Our model also consists
of a multi-reference alignment module to fuse the features derived from similar
patches: we fuse the features of distant references to perform high-quality
super-resolution. We also propose a novel and practical training strategy for
referenced-based super-resolution. To evaluate the performance of our proposed
method, we conduct extensive experiments on our collected CarCam dataset and
the Waymo Open dataset, and the results demonstrate our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Our source code will be publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Detection of semantic data types is a very crucial task in data science for
automated data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, semantic data type
normalization and sensitive data identification. Existing methods include
regular expression-based or dictionary lookup-based methods that are not robust
to dirty as well unseen data and are limited to a very less number of semantic
data types to predict. Existing Machine Learning methods extract large number
of engineered features from data and build logistic regression, random forest
or feedforward neural network for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce
DCoM, a collection of multi-input NLP-based deep neural networks to detect
semantic data types where instead of extracting large number of features from
the data, we feed the raw values of columns (or instances) to the model as
texts. We train DCoM on 686,765 data columns extracted from VizNet corpus with
78 different semantic data types. DCoM outperforms other contemporary results
with a quite significant margin on the same dataset.</span>

superior lossy compression performance. However, distinct models are required
to be trained to reach different points in the rate-distortion (R-D) space. In
this paper, we consider the problem of R-D characteristic analysis and modeling
for NIC. We make efforts to formulate the essential mathematical functions to
describe the R-D behavior of NIC using deep network and statistical modeling.
Thus continuous bit-rate points could be elegantly realized by leveraging such
model via a single trained network. In this regard, we propose a plugin-in
module to learn the relationship between the target bit-rate and the binary
representation for the latent variable of auto-encoder. Furthermore, we model
the rate and distortion characteristic of NIC as a function of the coding
parameter $\lambda$ respectively. Our experiments show our proposed method is
easy to adopt and obtains competitive coding performance with fixed-rate coding
approaches, which would benefit the practical deployment of NIC. In addition,
the proposed model could be applied to NIC rate control with limited bit-rate
error using a single network.</span>

other fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However,
success always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are
data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the
medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning
to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis
are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also
require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it
difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large
medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a
collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep
learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred
datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized
them into four categories: head &amp; neck, chest &amp; abdomen, pathology &amp; blood, and
&#x60;&#x60;others&#x27;&#x27;. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and
complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the
datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the
methodology to test and evaluate their methods&#x27; performance and robustness on
relevant datasets, 3) to provide a &#x60;&#x60;route&#x27;&#x27; to relevant algorithms for the
relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.</span>

                                        <span>With the rapid progress of deepfake techniques in recent years, facial video
forgery can generate highly deceptive video contents and bring severe security
threats. And detection of such forgery videos is much more urgent and
challenging. Most existing detection methods treat the problem as a vanilla
binary classification problem. In this paper, the problem is treated as a
special fine-grained classification problem since the differences between fake
and real faces are very subtle. It is observed that most existing face forgery
methods left some common artifacts in the spatial domain and time domain,
including generative defects in the spatial domain and inter-frame
inconsistencies in the time domain. And a spatial-temporal model is proposed
which has two components for capturing spatial and temporal forgery traces in
global perspective respectively. The two components are designed using a novel
long distance attention mechanism. The one component of the spatial domain is
used to capture artifacts in a single frame, and the other component of the
time domain is used to capture artifacts in consecutive frames. They generate
attention maps in the form of patches. The attention method has a broader
vision which contributes to better assembling global information and extracting
local statistic information. Finally, the attention maps are used to guide the
network to focus on pivotal parts of the face, just like other fine-grained
classification methods. The experimental results on different public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance,
and the proposed long distance attention method can effectively capture pivotal
parts for face forgery.</span>

                                        <span>The conventional spatial convolution layers in the Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive at the point where the training
time could take days unless the number of layers, the number of training images
or the size of the training images are reduced. The image size of 256x256
pixels is commonly used for most of the applications of CNN, but this image
size is too small for applications like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
classification where the image details are important for accurate
classification. This research proposed Frequency Domain Convolution (FDC) and
Frequency Domain Pooling (FDP) layers which were built with RFFT, kernel
initialization strategy, convolution artifact removal and Channel Independent
Convolution (CIC) to replace the conventional convolution and pooling layers.
The FDC and FDP layers are used to build a Frequency Domain Convolutional
Neural Network (FDCNN) to accelerate the training of large images for DR
classification. The Full FDC layer is an extension of the FDC layer to allow
direct use in conventional CNNs, it is also used to modify the VGG16
architecture. FDCNN is shown to be at least 54.21% faster and 70.74% more
memory efficient compared to an equivalent CNN architecture. The modified VGG16
architecture with Full FDC layer is reported to achieve a shorter training time

DR classification.</span>

                                        <span>In the past few years, we have witnessed rapid development of autonomous
driving. However, achieving full autonomy remains a daunting task due to the
complex and dynamic driving environment. As a result, self-driving cars are
equipped with a suite of sensors to conduct robust and accurate environment
perception. As the number and type of sensors keep increasing, combining them
for better perception is becoming a natural trend. So far, there has been no
indepth review that focuses on multi-sensor fusion based perception. To bridge
this gap and motivate future research, this survey devotes to review recent
fusion-based 3D detection deep learning models that leverage multiple sensor
data sources, especially cameras and LiDARs. In this survey, we first introduce
the background of popular sensors for autonomous cars, including their common
data representations as well as object detection networks developed for each
type of sensor data. Next, we discuss some popular datasets for multi-modal 3D
object detection, with a special focus on the sensor data included in each
dataset. Then we present in-depth reviews of recent multi-modal 3D detection
networks by considering the following three aspects of the fusion: fusion
location, fusion data representation, and fusion granularity. After a detailed
review, we discuss open challenges and point out possible solutions. We hope
that our detailed review can help researchers to embark investigations in the
area of multi-modal 3D object detection.</span>

technologies to ensure the success of the exploration. In such a GPS denied
environment, vision-based localization is an optimal approach. In this paper,
we proposed a multi-modal registration based SLAM algorithm, which estimates
the location of a planet UAV using a nadir view camera on the UAV compared with
pre-existing digital terrain model. To overcome the scale and appearance
difference between on-board UAV images and pre-installed digital terrain model,
a theoretical model is proposed to prove that topographic features of UAV image
and DEM can be correlated in frequency domain via cross power spectrum. To
provide the six-DOF of the UAV, we also developed an optimization approach
which fuses the geo-referencing result into a SLAM system via LBA (Local Bundle
Adjustment) to achieve robust and accurate vision-based navigation even in
featureless planetary areas. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed localization algorithm, a new cross-source drone-based localization
dataset for planetary exploration is proposed. The proposed dataset includes
40200 synthetic drone images taken from nine planetary scenes with related DEM
query images. Comparison experiments carried out demonstrate that over the
flight distance of 33.8km, the proposed method achieved average localization
error of 0.45 meters, compared to 1.31 meters by ORB-SLAM, with the processing
speed of 12hz which will ensure a real-time performance. We will make our
datasets available to encourage further work on this promising topic.</span>

                                        <span>Novelty Detection methods identify samples that are not representative of a
model&#x27;s training set thereby flagging misleading predictions and bringing a
greater flexibility and transparency at deployment time. However, research in
this area has only considered Novelty Detection in the offline setting.
Recently, there has been a growing realization in the computer vision community
that applications demand a more flexible framework - Continual Learning - where
new batches of data representing new domains, new classes or new tasks become
available at different points in time. In this setting, Novelty Detection
becomes more important, interesting and challenging. This work identifies the
crucial link between the two problems and investigates the Novelty Detection
problem under the Continual Learning setting. We formulate the Continual
Novelty Detection problem and present a benchmark, where we compare several
Novelty Detection methods under different Continual Learning settings.

We show that Continual Learning affects the behaviour of novelty detection
algorithms, while novelty detection can pinpoint insights in the behaviour of a
continual learner. We further propose baselines and discuss possible research
directions. We believe that the coupling of the two problems is a promising
direction to bring vision models into practice.</span>

                                        <span>Visual place recognition is a fundamental capability for the localization of
mobile robots. It places image retrieval in the practical context of physical
agents operating in a physical world. It is an active field of research and
many different approaches have been proposed and evaluated in many different
experiments. In the following, we argue that due to variations of this
practical context and individual design decisions, place recognition
experiments are barely comparable across different papers and that there is a
variety of properties that can change from one experiment to another. We
provide an extensive list of such properties and give examples how they can be
used to setup a place recognition experiment easier or harder. This might be
interesting for different involved parties: (1) people who just want to select
a place recognition approach that is suitable for the properties of their
particular task at hand, (2) researchers that look for open research questions
and are interested in particularly difficult instances, (3) authors that want
to create reproducible papers on this topic, and (4) also reviewers that have

                                        <span>Traditional feature-based image stitching technologies rely heavily on
feature detection quality, often failing to stitch images with few features or
low resolution. The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied
due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To
address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching
framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and
unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an
ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is
more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is
introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the
second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level
can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an
unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from
features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented
by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch,
learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution
simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning
framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image
stitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the
superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared
with the supervised solutions, our image stitching quality is still preferred
by users.</span>

                                        <span>Arbitrary-shaped text detection is a challenging task since curved texts in
the wild are of the complex geometric layouts. Existing mainstream methods
follow the instance segmentation pipeline to obtain the text regions. However,
arbitraryshaped texts are difficult to be depicted through one single
segmentation network because of the varying scales. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage segmentation-based detector, termed as NASK (Need A Second looK), for
arbitrary-shaped text detection. Compared to the traditional single-stage
segmentation network, our NASK conducts the detection in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the first stage segmentation spotting the rectangle text proposals
and the second one retrieving compact representations. Specifically, NASK is
composed of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network (1st stage), a
Geometry-aware Text RoI Alignment (GeoAlign) module, and a Fiducial pOint
eXpression (FOX) module (2nd stage). Firstly, TIS extracts the augmented
features with a novel Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module and
conducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle proposals. Then, GeoAlign
converts these rectangles into the fixed size and encodes RoI-wise feature
representation. Finally, FOX disintegrates the text instance into serval
pivotal geometrical attributes to refine the detection results. Extensive
experimental results on three public benchmarks including Total-Text,
SCUTCTW1500, and ICDAR 2015 verify that our NASK outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

and compression process, and can use fewer observations to achieve accurate
signal recovery, providing a solution for better and faster transmission of
massive data. In this paper, a ternary sampling matrix-based method with
attention mechanism is proposed with the purpose to solve the problem that the
CS sampling matrices in most cases are random matrices, which are irrelative to
the sampled signal and need a large storage space. The proposed method consists
of three components, i.e., ternary sampling, initial reconstruction and deep
reconstruction, with the emphasis on the ternary sampling. The main idea of the
ternary method (-1, 0, +1) is to introduce the attention mechanism to evaluate
the importance of parameters at the sampling layer after the sampling matrix is
binarized (-1, +1), followed by pruning weight of parameters, whose importance
is below a predefined threshold, to achieve ternarization. Furthermore, a
compressed sensing algorithm especially for image reconstruction is
implemented, on the basis of the ternary sampling matrix, which is called
ATP-Net, i.e., Attention-based ternary projection network. Experimental results
show that the quality of image reconstruction by means of ATP-Net maintains a
satisfactory level with the employment of the ternary sampling matrix, i.e.,
the average PSNR on Set11 is 30.4 when the sampling rate is 0.25, approximately
6% improvement compared with that of DR2-Net.</span>

                                        <span>Quite a few people in the world have to stay under permanent surveillance for
health reasons; they include diabetic people or people with some other chronic
conditions, the elderly and the disabled.These groups may face heightened risk
of having life-threatening falls or of being struck by a syncope. Due to
limited availability of resources a substantial part of people at risk can not
receive necessary monitoring and thus are exposed to excessive danger.
Nowadays, this problem is usually solved via applying Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) methods. HAR is a perspective and fast-paced Data Science
field, which has a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sport,
security etc. However, the currently techniques of recognition are markedly
lacking in accuracy, hence, the present paper suggests a highly accurate method
for human activity classification. Wepropose a new workflow to address the HAR
problem and evaluate it on the UniMiB SHAR dataset, which consists of the
accelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform
localizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a
CNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting
that CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to
obtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive
capacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and
vary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number
of neurons in each layer, image size, type of mother wavelet, the order of zero
moment of mother wavelet etc. Besides, we also apply models with residual
blocks which resulted in significantly higher metric values. Finally, we
succeed to reach 99.26 % accuracy and it is a worthy performance for this
problem.</span>

                                        <span>Many works in the recent literature introduce semantic mapping methods that
use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize semantic properties in
images. The types of properties (eg.: room size, place category, and objects)
and their classes (eg.: kitchen and bathroom, for place category) are usually
predefined and restricted to a specific task. Thus, all the visual data
acquired and processed during the construction of the maps are lost and only
the recognized semantic properties remain on the maps. In contrast, this work
introduces a topological semantic mapping method that uses deep visual features
extracted by a CNN, the GoogLeNet, from 2D images captured in multiple views of
the environment as the robot operates, to create consolidated representations
of visual features acquired in the regions covered by each topological node.
These consolidated representations allow flexible recognition of semantic
properties of the regions and use in a range of visual tasks. The experiments,
performed using a real-world indoor dataset, showed that the method is able to
consolidate the visual features of regions and use them to recognize objects
and place categories as semantic properties, and to indicate the topological
location of images, with very promising results. The objects are classified
using the classification layer of GoogLeNet, without retraining, and the place
categories are recognized using a shallow Multilayer Perceptron.</span>

                                        <span>Recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results and runtime
advantages in deformable image registration. However, analyzing the effects of
hyperparameters and searching for optimal regularization parameters prove to be
too prohibitive in deep learning-based methods. This is because it involves
training a substantial number of separate models with distinct hyperparameter
values. In this paper, we propose a conditional image registration method and a
new self-supervised learning paradigm for deep deformable image registration.
By learning the conditional features that correlated with the regularization
hyperparameter, we demonstrate that optimal solutions with arbitrary
hyperparameters can be captured by a single deep convolutional neural network.
In addition, the smoothness of the resulting deformation field can be
manipulated with arbitrary strength of smoothness regularization during
inference. Extensive experiments on a large-scale brain MRI dataset show that
our proposed method enables the precise control of the smoothness of the
deformation field without sacrificing the runtime advantage or registration
accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Anime is quite well-received today, especially among the younger generations.
With many genres of available shows, more and more people are increasingly
getting attracted to this niche section of the entertainment industry. As anime
has recently garnered mainstream attention, we have insufficient information
regarding users&#x27; penchant and watching habits. Therefore, it is an uphill task
to build a recommendation engine for this relatively obscure entertainment
medium. In this attempt, we have built a novel hybrid recommendation system
that could act both as a recommendation system and as a means of exploring new
anime genres and titles. We have analyzed the general trends in this field and
the users&#x27; watching habits for coming up with our efficacious solution. Our
solution employs deep autoencoders for the tasks of predicting ratings and
generating embeddings. Following this, we formed clusters using the embeddings
of the anime titles. These clusters form the search space for anime with
similarities and are used to find anime similar to the ones liked and disliked
by the user. This method, combined with the predicted ratings, forms the novel
hybrid filter. In this article, we have demonstrated this idea and compared the
performance of our implemented model with the existing state-of-the-art
techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Spoken conversational question answering (SCQA) requires machines to model
complex dialogue flow given the speech utterances and text corpora. Different
from traditional text question answering (QA) tasks, SCQA involves audio signal
processing, passage comprehension, and contextual understanding. However, ASR
systems introduce unexpected noisy signals to the transcriptions, which result
in performance degradation on SCQA. To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,
a novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies
both cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized
embedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance
improvements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation
framework to distill the ASR-robust knowledge from the estimated probabilities
of the teacher model to the student. We conduct extensive experiments on the
Spoken-CoQA dataset and demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable
performance in this task.</span>

                                        <span>Process mining is a relatively new subject which builds a bridge between
process modelling and data mining. An exclusive choice in a process model
usually splits the process into different branches. However, in some processes,
it is possible to switch from one branch to another. The inductive miner
guarantees to return sound process models, but fails to return a precise model
when there are switch behaviours between different exclusive choice branches
due to the limitation of process trees. In this paper, we present a novel
extension to the process tree model to support switch behaviours between
different branches of the exclusive choice operator and propose a novel
extension to the inductive miner to discover sound process models with switch
behaviours. The proposed discovery technique utilizes the theory of a previous
study to detect possible switch behaviours. We apply both artificial and
publicly-available datasets to evaluate our approach. Our results show that our
approach can improve the precision of discovered models by 36% while
maintaining high fitness values compared to the original inductive miner.</span>

                                        <span>Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they
provide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become
inconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific
knowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,
we propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system
with novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the
classification performance of the system has been improved with three effective
techniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning
technique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural
network layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with
new data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to
overcome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the
first iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained
simultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the
training process with another two iterations and the training processes for
other BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system
has been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and
BERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic
Acceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform
better than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.</span>

                                        <span>OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology
to produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary
supplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,
or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created
SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations
from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing
28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using
SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a
PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our
knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug
interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic
plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%
more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT
model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,
improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.
SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings
identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed
DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.
DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG
that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the
nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using
SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend
SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find
potential DS-Drug interactions.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a
customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog
of size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time
latency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall
but also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches
(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but
fail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,
embedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior
data, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to
latency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme
Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input
instances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve
semantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time
complexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical
linear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.
Quantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per
query and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a
competing embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning
with varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements
for online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that
are complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the
match set.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems -- and especially matrix factorization-based
collaborative filtering algorithms -- play a crucial role in mediating our
access to online information. We show that such algorithms induce a particular
kind of stereotyping: if preferences for a \textit{set} of items are
anti-correlated in the general user population, then those items may not be
recommended together to a user, regardless of that user&#x27;s preferences and
ratings history. First, we introduce a notion of \textit{joint accessibility},
which measures the extent to which a set of items can jointly be accessed by
users. We then study joint accessibility under the standard factorization-based
collaborative filtering framework, and provide theoretical necessary and
sufficient conditions when joint accessibility is violated. Moreover, we show
that these conditions can easily be violated when the users are represented by
a single feature vector. To improve joint accessibility, we further propose an
alternative modelling fix, which is designed to capture the diverse multiple
interests of each user using a multi-vector representation. We conduct
extensive experiments on real and simulated datasets, demonstrating the
stereotyping problem with standard single-vector matrix factorization models.</span>

                                        <span>In modern ranking problems, different and disparate representations of the
items to be ranked are often available. It is sensible, then, to try to combine
these representations to improve ranking. Indeed, learning to rank via
combining representations is both principled and practical for learning a
ranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,
however, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead
to a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the
effect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically
similar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data
examples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to
gainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe
and explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and
apply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the
Drosophila larva connectome.</span>

quadrupedal robots. Animals can actively switch gaits at different speeds to
lower their energy consumption. In this paper, we devise a hierarchical
learning framework, in which distinctive locomotion gaits and natural gait
transitions emerge automatically with a simple reward of energy minimization.
We use reinforcement learning to train a high-level gait policy that specifies
gait patterns of each foot, while the low-level whole-body controller optimizes
the motor commands so that the robot can walk at a desired velocity using that
gait pattern. We test our learning framework on a quadruped robot and
demonstrate automatic gait transitions, from walking to trotting and to
fly-trotting, as the robot increases its speed. We show that the learned
hierarchical controller consumes much less energy across a wide range of
locomotion speed than baseline controllers.</span>

are ubiquitous, for example, when the learner only has query access to the

the learner must evaluate the metric via performance evaluation using a small

training dataset such that the resulting weighted objective best approximates
the metric on the validation sample. We show how to model and estimate the
example weights and use them to iteratively post-shift a pre-trained class

                                        <span>Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the
movement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions
with semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale
video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D
human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body
motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we
present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions
being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about
43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of
abstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and
frame labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame
label is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the
mocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence
labels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action
categories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action
recognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To
demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of
models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting
learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve
as a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,
baseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for
academic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.</span>

                                        <span>Singular value decomposition is central to many problems in engineering and
scientific fields. Several quantum algorithms have been proposed to determine
the singular values and their associated singular vectors of a given matrix.
Although these algorithms are promising, the required quantum subroutines and
resources are too costly on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose
a variational quantum algorithm for singular value decomposition (VQSVD). By
exploiting the variational principles for singular values and the Ky Fan
Theorem, we design a novel loss function such that two quantum neural networks
(or parameterized quantum circuits) could be trained to learn the singular
vectors and output the corresponding singular values. Furthermore, we conduct
numerical simulations of VQSVD for random matrices as well as its applications
in image compression of handwritten digits. Finally, we discuss the
applications of our algorithm in recommendation systems and polar
decomposition. Our work explores new avenues for quantum information processing
beyond the conventional protocols that only works for Hermitian data, and
reveals the capability of matrix decomposition on near-term quantum devices.</span>

                                        <span>Vector-valued learning, where the output space admits a vector-valued
structure, is an important problem that covers a broad family of important
domains, e.g. multi-label learning and multi-class classification. Using local
Rademacher complexity and unlabeled data, we derive novel data-dependent excess
risk bounds for learning vector-valued functions in both the kernel space and
linear space. The derived bounds are much sharper than existing ones, where
convergence rates are improved from $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ to
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n+u}),$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ in special cases. Motivated
by our theoretical analysis, we propose a unified framework for learning
vector-valued functions, incorporating both local Rademacher complexity and
Laplacian regularization. Empirical results on a wide number of benchmark
datasets show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline
methods, which coincides with our theoretical findings.</span>

they shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making
processes. Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained
language models (LMs) that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting
undesirable representational biases - harmful biases resulting from
stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations involving gender, race,
religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards improving the fairness
of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational biases before
proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we
propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our

the kernel function of Hawkes processes. The non-parametric Bayesian approach
is important because it provides flexible Hawkes kernels and quantifies their
uncertainty. Our method is based on the cluster representation of Hawkes
processes. Utilizing the stationarity of the Hawkes process, we efficiently
sample random branching structures and thus, we split the Hawkes process into
clusters of Poisson processes. We derive two algorithms -- a block Gibbs
sampler and a maximum a posteriori estimator based on expectation maximization
-- and we show that our methods have a linear time complexity, both
theoretically and empirically. On synthetic data, we show our methods to be
able to infer flexible Hawkes triggering kernels. On two large-scale Twitter
diffusion datasets, we show that our methods outperform the current
state-of-the-art in goodness-of-fit and that the time complexity is linear in
the size of the dataset. We also observe that on diffusions related to online

hypotheses in a data-efficient manner. However, current ILP systems require
training examples to be specified in a structured logical form. This paper
introduces a neural-symbolic learning framework, called Feed-Forward
Neural-Symbolic Learner (FF-NSL), that integrates state-of-the-art ILP systems
based on the Answer Set semantics, with neural networks, in order to learn
interpretable hypotheses from labelled unstructured data. FF-NSL uses a
pre-trained neural network to extract symbolic facts from unstructured data and
an ILP system to learn a hypothesis that performs a downstream classification
task. In order to evaluate the applicability of our approach to real-world
applications, the framework is evaluated on tasks where distributional shifts
are introduced to unstructured input data, for which pre-trained neural
networks are likely to predict incorrectly and with high confidence.
Experimental results show that FF-NSL outperforms baseline approaches such as a
random forest and deep neural networks by learning more accurate and
interpretable hypotheses with fewer examples.</span>

Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy
on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on
Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and
temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of
locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy
trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally
even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video
architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the
image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image
models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of
video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1
accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20x less
pre-training data and ~3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1
accuracy on Something-Something v2). The code and models will be made publicly

                                        <span>In recent years, implicit deep learning has emerged as a method to increase
the depth of deep neural networks. While their training is memory-efficient,
they are still significantly slower to train than their explicit counterparts.
In Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs), the training is performed as a bi-level
problem, and its computational complexity is partially driven by the iterative
inversion of a huge Jacobian matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy
to tackle this computational bottleneck from which many bi-level problems
suffer. The main idea is to use the quasi-Newton matrices from the forward pass
to efficiently approximate the inverse Jacobian matrix in the direction needed
for the gradient computation. We provide a theorem that motivates using our
method with the original forward algorithms. In addition, by modifying these
forward algorithms, we further provide theoretical guarantees that our method
asymptotically estimates the true implicit gradient. We empirically study this
approach in many settings, ranging from hyperparameter optimization to large
Multiscale DEQs applied to CIFAR and ImageNet. We show that it reduces the
computational cost of the backward pass by up to two orders of magnitude. All
this is achieved while retaining the excellent performance of the original
models in hyperparameter optimization and on CIFAR, and giving encouraging and
competitive results on ImageNet.</span>

in bioinformatics. However, clinical predictions using information from
genomics datasets as well is not a frequently observed phenomenon in research.
Precision medicine research requires information from all available datasets to
provide intelligent clinical solutions. In this paper, we have attempted to
create a prediction model which uses information from both clinical and
genomics datasets. We have demonstrated multiclass disease predictions based on
combined clinical and genomics datasets using machine learning methods. We have
created an integrated dataset, using a clinical (ClinVar) and a genomics (gene
expression) dataset, and trained it using instance-based learner to predict
clinical diseases. We have used an innovative but simple way for multiclass
classification, where the number of output classes is as high as 75. We have
used Principal Component Analysis for feature selection. The classifier
predicted diseases with 73\% accuracy on the integrated dataset. The results
were consistent and competent when compared with other classification models.
The results show that genomics information can be reliably included in datasets
for clinical predictions and it can prove to be valuable in clinical
diagnostics and precision medicine.</span>

now widely used for source code processing, due to the format similarity
between source code and text. In contrast to natural language, source code is
strictly structured, i.e., it follows the syntax of the programming language.
Several recent works develop Transformer modifications for capturing syntactic
information in source code. The drawback of these works is that they do not
compare to each other and consider different tasks. In this work, we conduct a
thorough empirical study of the capabilities of Transformers to utilize
syntactic information in different tasks. We consider three tasks (code
completion, function naming and bug fixing) and re-implement different
syntax-capturing modifications in a unified framework. We show that
Transformers are able to make meaningful predictions based purely on syntactic
information and underline the best practices of taking the syntactic
information into account for improving the performance of the model.</span>

                                        <span>This paper introduces the Descriptive Variational Autoencoder (DVAE), an
unsupervised and end-to-end trainable neural network for predicting vehicle
trajectories that provides partial interpretability. The novel approach is
based on the architecture and objective of common variational autoencoders. By
introducing expert knowledge within the decoder part of the autoencoder, the
encoder learns to extract latent parameters that provide a graspable meaning in
human terms. Such an interpretable latent space enables the validation by
expert defined rule sets. The evaluation of the DVAE is performed using the
publicly available highD dataset for highway traffic scenarios. In comparison
to a conventional variational autoencoder with equivalent complexity, the
proposed model provides a similar prediction accuracy but with the great
advantage of having an interpretable latent space. For crucial decision making
and assessing trustworthiness of a prediction this property is highly
desirable.</span>

Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional
sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or
compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal
actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an
autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions,
our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the
desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds

the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. In particular, we consider the
convergence of policy gradient methods in the setting of known and unknown
parameters. We are able to produce a global linear convergence guarantee for
this approach in the setting of finite time horizon and stochastic state
dynamics under weak assumptions. The convergence of a projected policy gradient
method is also established in order to handle problems with constraints. We
illustrate the performance of the algorithm with two examples. The first
example is the optimal liquidation of a holding in an asset. We show results
for the case where we assume a model for the underlying dynamics and where we
apply the method to the data directly. The empirical evidence suggests that the
policy gradient method can learn the global optimal solution for a larger class
of stochastic systems containing the LQR framework and that it is more robust
with respect to model mis-specification when compared to a model-based
approach. The second example is an LQR system in a higher dimensional setting

privacy in machine learning (ML). Specifically, we study if a distributed
implementation of the renowned Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning
algorithm is feasible with both differential privacy (DP) and
$(\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to tackle this problem from a theoretical point of view. A key
finding of our analyses is that the classical approaches to these two
(seemingly) orthogonal issues are incompatible. More precisely, we show that a
direct composition of these techniques makes the guarantees of the resulting
SGD algorithm depend unfavourably upon the number of parameters of the ML
model, making the training of large models practically infeasible. We validate
our theoretical results through numerical experiments on publicly-available

predictions made by black-box AI systems that handle image and tabular data.
However, considerably less attention has been paid to explaining the
predictions of opaque AI systems handling time series data. In this paper, we
advance a novel model-agnostic, case-based technique -- Native Guide -- that
generates counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. Given a
query time series, $T_{q}$, for which a black-box classification system
predicts class, $c$, a counterfactual time series explanation shows how $T_{q}$
could change, such that the system predicts an alternative class, $c&#x27;$. The
proposed instance-based technique adapts existing counterfactual instances in
the case-base by highlighting and modifying discriminative areas of the time
series that underlie the classification. Quantitative and qualitative results
from two comparative experiments indicate that Native Guide generates
plausible, proximal, sparse and diverse explanations that are better than those
produced by key benchmark counterfactual methods.</span>

the normalization constraint is to ensure that the out-of-distribution (OOD)
regime has a small likelihood when samples are learned using maximum
likelihood. Because autoencoders do not possess such a process of
normalization, they often fail to recognize outliers even when they are
obviously OOD. We propose the Normalized Autoencoder (NAE), a normalized
probabilistic model constructed from an autoencoder. The probability density of
NAE is defined using the reconstruction error of an autoencoder, which is
differently defined in the conventional energy-based model. In our model,
normalization is enforced by suppressing the reconstruction of negative
samples, significantly improving the outlier detection performance. Our
experimental results confirm the efficacy of NAE, both in detecting outliers
and in generating in-distribution samples.</span>

estimating a coordinate-wise isotonic function on the domain $[0, 1]^d$ from
noisy observations collected on a uniform lattice, but where the design points
have been permuted along each dimension. While the univariate and bivariate
versions of this problem have received significant attention, our focus is on
the multivariate case $d \geq 3$. We study both the minimax risk of estimation
(in empirical $L_2$ loss) and the fundamental limits of adaptation (quantified
by the adaptivity index) to a family of piecewise constant functions. We
provide a computationally efficient Mirsky partition estimator that is minimax
optimal while also achieving the smallest adaptivity index possible for
polynomial time procedures. Thus, from a worst-case perspective and in sharp
contrast to the bivariate case, the latent permutations in the model do not
introduce significant computational difficulties over and above vanilla
isotonic regression. On the other hand, the fundamental limits of adaptation
are significantly different with and without unknown permutations: Assuming a
hardness conjecture from average-case complexity theory, a
statistical-computational gap manifests in the former case. In a complementary
direction, we show that natural modifications of existing estimators fail to
satisfy at least one of the desiderata of optimal worst-case statistical
performance, computational efficiency, and fast adaptation. Along the way to
showing our results, we improve adaptation results in the special case $d &#x3D; 2$
and establish some properties of estimators for vanilla isotonic regression,
both of which may be of independent interest.</span>

ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable.
These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of
paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of
energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in
centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To
overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated
learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at
solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the
similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design
federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model,
and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training
convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our
federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets
generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart
building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods
in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall
training cost without compromising the prediction performance.</span>

                                        <span>We present a new, simple and computationally efficient iterative method for
low rank matrix completion. Our method is inspired by the class of
factorization-type iterative algorithms, but substantially differs from them in
the way the problem is cast. Precisely, given a target rank $r$, instead of
optimizing on the manifold of rank $r$ matrices, we allow our interim estimated
matrix to have a specific over-parametrized rank $2r$ structure. Our algorithm,
denoted R2RILS for rank $2r$ iterative least squares, has low memory
requirements, and at each iteration it solves a computationally cheap sparse
least-squares problem. We motivate our algorithm by its theoretical analysis
for the simplified case of a rank-1 matrix. Empirically, R2RILS is able to
recover ill conditioned low rank matrices from very few observations -- near
the information limit, and it is stable to additive noise.</span>

                                        <span>Warming oceans due to climate change are leading to increased numbers of
ectoparasitic copepods, also known as sea lice, which can cause significant
ecological loss to wild salmon populations and major economic loss to
aquaculture sites. The main transport mechanism driving the spread of sea lice
populations are near-surface ocean currents. Present strategies to estimate the
distribution of sea lice larvae are computationally complex and limit
full-scale analysis. Motivated to address this challenge, we propose SALT: Sea
lice Adaptive Lattice Tracking approach for efficient estimation of sea lice
dispersion and distribution in space and time. Specifically, an adaptive
spatial mesh is generated by merging nodes in the lattice graph of the Ocean
Model based on local ocean properties, thus enabling highly efficient graph
representation. SALT demonstrates improved efficiency while maintaining
consistent results with the standard method, using near-surface current data
for Hardangerfjord, Norway. The proposed SALT technique shows promise for
enhancing proactive aquaculture management through predictive modelling of sea
lice infestation pressure maps in a changing climate.</span>

elements from wav2vec 2.0 and VQ-VAE. Our model learns to reproduce quantized
representations from partially masked speech encoding using a contrastive loss
in a way similar to Wav2vec 2.0. However, the quantization process is
regularized by an additional consistency network that learns to reconstruct the
input features to the wav2vec 2.0 network from the quantized representations in
a way similar to a VQ-VAE model. The proposed self-supervised model is trained
on 10k hours of unlabeled data and subsequently used as the speech encoder in a
RNN-T ASR model and fine-tuned with 1k hours of labeled data. This work is one
of only a few studies of self-supervised learning on speech tasks with a large
volume of real far-field labeled data. The Wav2vec-C encoded representations
achieves, on average, twice the error reduction over baseline and a higher

                                        <span>We introduce and investigate matrix approximation by decomposition into a sum
of radial basis function (RBF) components. An RBF component is a generalization
of the outer product between a pair of vectors, where an RBF function replaces
the scalar multiplication between individual vector elements. Even though the
RBF functions are positive definite, the summation across components is not
restricted to convex combinations and allows us to compute the decomposition
for any real matrix that is not necessarily symmetric or positive definite. We
formulate the problem of seeking such a decomposition as an optimization
problem with a nonlinear and non-convex loss function. Several modern versions
of the gradient descent method, including their scalable stochastic
counterparts, are used to solve this problem. We provide extensive empirical
evidence of the effectiveness of the RBF decomposition and that of the
gradient-based fitting algorithm. While being conceptually motivated by
singular value decomposition (SVD), our proposed nonlinear counterpart
outperforms SVD by drastically reducing the memory required to approximate a
data matrix with the same L2 error for a wide range of matrix types. For
example, it leads to 2 to 6 times memory save for Gaussian noise, graph
adjacency matrices, and kernel matrices. Moreover, this proximity-based
decomposition can offer additional interpretability in applications that
involve, e.g., capturing the inner low-dimensional structure of the data,
retaining graph connectivity structure, and preserving the acutance of images.</span>

                                        <span>Current deep learning approaches for diffusion MRI modeling circumvent the
need for densely-sampled diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) by directly
predicting microstructural indices from sparsely-sampled DWIs. However, they
implicitly make unrealistic assumptions of static $q$-space sampling during
training and reconstruction. Further, such approaches can restrict downstream
usage of variably sampled DWIs for usages including the estimation of
microstructural indices or tractography. We propose a generative adversarial
translation framework for high-quality DWI synthesis with arbitrary $q$-space
sampling given commonly acquired structural images (e.g., B0, T1, T2). Our
translation network linearly modulates its internal representations conditioned
on continuous $q$-space information, thus removing the need for fixed sampling
schemes. Moreover, this approach enables downstream estimation of high-quality
microstructural maps from arbitrarily subsampled DWIs, which may be
particularly important in cases with sparsely sampled DWIs. Across several
recent methodologies, the proposed approach yields improved DWI synthesis
accuracy and fidelity with enhanced downstream utility as quantified by the
accuracy of scalar microstructure indices estimated from the synthesized
images. Code is available at

more challenging to ensure that all the relevant content is tested and that any
potential issue is properly identified and fixed. Attempting to maximize
testing coverage using only human participants, however, results in a tedious
and hard to orchestrate process which normally slows down the development
cycle. Complementing playtesting via autonomous agents has shown great promise
accelerating and simplifying this process. This paper addresses the problem of
automatically exploring and testing a given scenario using reinforcement
learning agents trained to maximize game state coverage. Each of these agents
is rewarded based on the novelty of its actions, thus encouraging a curious and
exploratory behaviour on a complex 3D scenario where previously proposed
exploration techniques perform poorly. The curious agents are able to learn the
complex navigation mechanics required to reach the different areas around the
map, thus providing the necessary data to identify potential issues. Moreover,
the paper also explores different visualization strategies and evaluates how to

                                        <span>Federated learning is emerging as a machine learning technique that trains a
model across multiple decentralized parties. It is renowned for preserving
privacy as the data never leaves the computational devices, and recent
approaches further enhance its privacy by hiding messages transferred in
encryption. However, we found that despite the efforts, federated learning
remains privacy-threatening, due to its interactive nature across different
parties. In this paper, we analyze the privacy threats in industrial-level
federated learning frameworks with secure computation, and reveal such threats
widely exist in typical machine learning models such as linear regression,
logistic regression and decision tree. For the linear and logistic regression,
we show through theoretical analysis that it is possible for the attacker to
invert the entire private input of the victim, given very few information. For
the decision tree model, we launch an attack to infer the range of victim&#x27;s
private inputs. All attacks are evaluated on popular federated learning
frameworks and real-world datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is believed to have higher sample
efficiency compared with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However,
MBRL is plagued by dynamics bottleneck dilemma. Dynamics bottleneck dilemma is
the phenomenon that the performance of the algorithm falls into the local
optimum instead of increasing when the interaction step with the environment
increases, which means more data can not bring better performance. In this
paper, we find that the trajectory reward estimation error is the main reason
that causes dynamics bottleneck dilemma through theoretical analysis. We give
an upper bound of the trajectory reward estimation error and point out that
increasing the agent&#x27;s exploration ability is the key to reduce trajectory
reward estimation error, thereby alleviating dynamics bottleneck dilemma.
Motivated by this, a model-based control method combined with exploration named
MOdel-based Progressive Entropy-based Exploration (MOPE2) is proposed. We
conduct experiments on several complex continuous control benchmark tasks. The
results verify that MOPE2 can effectively alleviate dynamics bottleneck dilemma
and have higher sample efficiency than previous MBRL and MFRL algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Structural features are important features in graph datasets. However,
although there are some correlation analysis of features based on covariance,
there is no relevant research on exploring structural feature correlation on
graphs with graph neural network based models. In this paper, we introduce
graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional
space to explore some preliminary results on structural feature correlation,
which is based on graph neural network. The results show that there exists high
correlation between some of the structural features. A redundant feature
combination with initial node features, which is filtered by graph neural
network has improved its classification accuracy in some graph datasets. We
compare the difference between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings
between features and show that the simplest is the best. We generalize on the
synthetic geometric graphs and certify the results on prediction difficulty
between two structural features.</span>

                                        <span>A key challenge in mining social media data streams is to identify events
which are actively discussed by a group of people in a specific local or global
area. Such events are useful for early warning for accident, protest, election
or breaking news. However, neither the list of events nor the resolution of
both event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we
propose an online spatio-temporal event detection system using social media
that is able to detect events at different time and space resolutions. First,
to address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events, a
quad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into
multiscale regions based on the density of social media data. Then, a
statistical unsupervised approach is performed that involves Poisson
distribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected
density of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by
merging events happening in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A
post processing stage is introduced to filter out events that are spam, fake or
wrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social media entities
to assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method
is evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for
different cities: Melbourne, London, Paris and New York. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results with two baseline
algorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.
For performance evaluation, we manually compute recall and precision. We also
propose a new quality measure named strength index, which automatically
measures how accurate the reported event is.</span>

                                        <span>When reasoning about strategic behavior in a machine learning context it is
tempting to combine standard microfoundations of rational agents with the
statistical decision theory underlying classification. In this work, we argue
that a direct combination of these standard ingredients leads to brittle
solution concepts of limited descriptive and prescriptive value. First, we show
that rational agents with perfect information produce discontinuities in the
aggregate response to a decision rule that we often do not observe empirically.
Second, when any positive fraction of agents is not perfectly strategic,
desirable stable points -- where the classifier is optimal for the data it
entails -- cease to exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard
microfoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social
burden within a broad class of possible assumptions about agent behavior.

Recognizing these limitations we explore alternatives to standard
microfoundations for binary classification. We start by describing a set of
desiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about how
agents respond to a decision rule. In particular, we analyze a natural
constraint on feature manipulations, and discuss properties that are sufficient
to guarantee the robust existence of stable points. Building on these insights,
we then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed analysis and
empirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in the agent
responses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard
microfoundations. Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more
robust insights about stable points, and imposes a lower social burden at
optimality.</span>

designed for a learning task when annotated data is scarce, for example, in
depressive language detection from Tweets. We start with a rich word embedding
pre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with
embeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through
a simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other
more sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder
based and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding
representations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar
semantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations
better capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the
semantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the
general language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our
word embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known
sentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word
embedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine
learning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets
identification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations
achieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied
to a high quality dataset. Also, we present several data ablation tests which
confirm the efficacy of our augmentation techniques.</span>

survey of safe reinforcement learning algorithms was published in 2015, a

those algorithms from a number of domains including reinforcement learning,
Gaussian process regression and classification, evolutionary algorithms, and
active learning. We provide the fundamental concepts on which the reviewed
algorithms are based and a characterization of the individual algorithms. We

differentially private SGD on large neural networks, which are 1) the huge
memory cost of storing individual gradients, 2) the added noise suffering
notorious dimensional dependence. Specifically, we reparametrize each weight
matrix with two \emph{gradient-carrier} matrices of small dimension and a
\emph{residual weight} matrix. We argue that such reparametrization keeps the
forward/backward process unchanged while enabling us to compute the projected
gradient without computing the gradient itself. To learn with differential
privacy, we design \emph{reparametrized gradient perturbation (RGP)} that
perturbs the gradients on gradient-carrier matrices and reconstructs an update
for the original weight from the noisy gradients. Importantly, we use
historical updates to find the gradient-carrier matrices, whose optimality is
rigorously justified under linear regression and empirically verified with deep
learning tasks. RGP significantly reduces the memory cost and improves the
utility. For example, we are the first able to apply differential privacy on
the BERT model and achieve an average accuracy of $83.9\%$ on four downstream
tasks with $\epsilon&#x3D;8$, which is within $5\%$ loss compared to the non-private
baseline but enjoys much lower privacy leakage risk.</span>

                                        <span>In spoken conversational question answering (SCQA), the answer to the
corresponding question is generated by retrieving and then analyzing a fixed
spoken document, including multi-part conversations. Most SCQA systems have
considered only retrieving information from ordered utterances. However, the
sequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken
conversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order
may severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we
introduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence
discrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly
capture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken
documents. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the
auxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards
more coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the
proposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more
coherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance
gains compared to the original pre-trained language models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Spoken-CoQA dataset.</span>

matrix of value functions. This is challenging from an implementation

to biased Hessian estimates. In this work, we provide a unifying framework for
estimating higher-order derivatives of value functions, based on off-policy

the theoretical rigor of kernel methods and can scale up to modern learning
tasks. This paper views uncertain system models as unknown or uncertain smooth
functions in universal reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. By directly
approximating the one-step dynamics function using random features with
uncertain parameters, which are equivalent to a shallow Bayesian neural
network, we then view the whole dynamical system as a multi-layer neural

worst-case dynamics realizations using Pontryagin&#x27;s minimum principle is
equivalent to performing the Frank-Wolfe algorithm on the deep net. Various

functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning (ML)-acceleration is essential in
rapid materials discovery. By necessity, efficient DFT-based workflows are
carried out with a single density functional approximation (DFA). Nevertheless,
properties evaluated with different DFAs can be expected to disagree for the
cases with challenging electronic structure (e.g., open shell transition metal
complexes, TMCs) for which rapid screening is most needed and accurate
benchmarks are often unavailable. To quantify the effect of DFA bias, we
introduce an approach to rapidly obtain property predictions from 23
representative DFAs spanning multiple families and &quot;rungs&quot; (e.g., semi-local to
double hybrid) and basis sets on over 2,000 TMCs. Although computed properties
(e.g., spin-state ordering and frontier orbital gap) naturally differ by DFA,
high linear correlations persist across all DFAs. We train independent ML
models for each DFA and observe convergent trends in feature importance; these
features thus provide DFA-invariant, universal design rules. We devise a
strategy to train ML models informed by all 23 DFAs and use them to predict
properties (e.g., spin-splitting energy) of over 182k TMCs. By requiring
consensus of the ANN-predicted DFA properties, we improve correspondence of
these computational lead compounds with literature-mined, experimental
compounds over the single-DFA approach typically employed. Both feature
analysis and consensus-based ML provide efficient, alternative paths to
overcome accuracy limitations of practical DFT.</span>

                                        <span>We study the recent emerging personalized federated learning (PFL) that aims
at dealing with the challenging problem of Non-I.I.D. data in the federated
learning (FL) setting. The key difference between PFL and conventional FL lies
in the training target, of which the personalized models in PFL usually pursue
a trade-off between personalization (i.e., usually from local models) and
generalization (i.e., usually from the global model) on trained models.
Conventional FL methods can hardly meet this target because of their both
well-developed global and local models. The prevalent PFL approaches usually
maintain a global model to guide the training process of local models and
transfer a proper degree of generalization to them. However, the sole global
model can only provide one direction of generalization and may even transfer
negative effects to some local models when rich statistical diversity exists
across multiple local datasets. Based on our observation, most real or
synthetic data distributions usually tend to be clustered to some degree, of
which we argue different directions of generalization can facilitate the PFL.
In this paper, we propose a novel concept called clustered generalization to
handle the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in FL. Specifically, we
maintain multiple global (generalized) models in the server to associate with
the corresponding amount of local model clusters in clients, and further
formulate the PFL as a bi-level optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently and robustly. We also conduct detailed theoretical analysis and
provide the convergence guarantee for the smooth non-convex objectives.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach
surpasses the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.</span>

solution of complex reinforcement learning problems that unfold over extended
periods. We argue that a robust way of combining skills is to define and
manipulate them in the space of pseudo-rewards (or &quot;cumulants&quot;). Based on this
premise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of
options. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously
represented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this
insight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to
approximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of
known options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a
set of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any
linear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this
framework provides a hierarchical interface to the environment whose abstract
actions correspond to combinations of basic skills. We demonstrate the
practical benefits of our approach in a resource management problem and a

                                        <span>Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning
approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data
collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to
impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing
various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These
assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to
non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or
bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose
aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip
aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and
depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the
ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth
texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),
we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real
image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise
a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,
bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into
other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in
shallow DoF rendering.</span>

fields. However, EEG applications are limited by low signal-to-noise ratios.
Multiple types of artifacts contribute to the noisiness of EEG, and many
techniques have been proposed to detect and correct these artifacts. These
techniques range from simply detecting and rejecting artifact ridden segments,
to extracting the noise component from the EEG signal. In this paper we review

research and ultimately lead to better public health. However, sharing
biomedical data can put sensitive personal information at risk. This is usually
solved by anonymization, which is a slow and expensive process. An alternative
to anonymization is sharing a synthetic dataset that bears a behaviour similar
to the real data but preserves privacy. As part of the collaboration between
Novartis and the Oxford Big Data Institute, we generate a synthetic dataset
based on COSENTYX (secukinumab) Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) clinical study. We
apply an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ac-GAN) to generate synthetic magnetic
resonance images (MRIs) of vertebral units (VUs). The images are conditioned on
the VU location (cervical, thoracic and lumbar). In this paper, we present a
method for generating a synthetic dataset and conduct an in-depth analysis on
its properties of along three key metrics: image fidelity, sample diversity and
dataset privacy.</span>

prediction strategies can rarely be understood. With recent advances in
Explainable Artificial Intelligence, approaches are available to explore the
reasoning behind those complex models&#x27; predictions. One class of approaches are
post-hoc attribution methods, among which Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
(LRP) shows high performance. However, the attempt at understanding a DNN&#x27;s
reasoning often stops at the attributions obtained for individual samples in
input space, leaving the potential for deeper quantitative analyses untouched.
As a manual analysis without the right tools is often unnecessarily labor
intensive, we introduce three software packages targeted at scientists to
explore model reasoning using attribution approaches and beyond: (1) Zennit - a
highly customizable and intuitive attribution framework implementing LRP and
related approaches in PyTorch, (2) CoRelAy - a framework to easily and quickly
construct quantitative analysis pipelines for dataset-wide analyses of
explanations, and (3) ViRelAy - a web-application to interactively explore
data, attributions, and analysis results.</span>

                                        <span>Motivated by cutting-edge applications like cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that \emph{sparse} signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$
sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Our results explore and
exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in
applied mathematics: the \textit{beltway problem} from combinatorial
optimization, and \textit{uniform uncertainty principles} from harmonic
analysis.</span>

                                        <span>Leveraging the framework of Optimal Transport, we introduce a new family of
generative autoencoders with a learnable prior, called Symmetric Wasserstein
Autoencoders (SWAEs). We propose to symmetrically match the joint distributions
of the observed data and the latent representation induced by the encoder and
the decoder. The resulting algorithm jointly optimizes the modelling losses in
both the data and the latent spaces with the loss in the data space leading to
the denoising effect. With the symmetric treatment of the data and the latent
representation, the algorithm implicitly preserves the local structure of the
data in the latent space. To further improve the quality of the latent
representation, we incorporate a reconstruction loss into the objective, which
significantly benefits both the generation and reconstruction. We empirically
show the superior performance of SWAEs over the state-of-the-art generative
autoencoders in terms of classification, reconstruction, and generation.</span>

order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural
networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along
with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these
architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data
augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we
propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption
robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more
robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that
vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more
shape bias. Our code is available to reproduce.</span>

                                        <span>Mental health conditions remain underdiagnosed even in countries with common
access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently
predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications
for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health
disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily
smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without
identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable
information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we
study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile
behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using
computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of
mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app
usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to
predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate
representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate
user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal
representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward
the performance-privacy frontier.</span>

containing discrete and continuous variables (mixed data). In addition to the
classical learning methods on discretized data, this library proposes its
algorithm that allows structural learning and parameters learning from mixed
data without discretization since data discretization leads to information
loss. This algorithm based on mixed MI score function for structural learning,
and also linear regression and Gaussian distribution approximation for
parameters learning. The library also offers two algorithms for enumerating
graph structures - the greedy Hill-Climbing algorithm and the evolutionary
algorithm. Thus the key capabilities of the proposed library are as follows:
(1) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on discretized
data, (2) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on mixed
data using the MI mixed score function and Gaussian approximation, (3)
launching learning algorithms on one of two algorithms for enumerating graph
structures - Hill-Climbing and the evolutionary algorithm. Since the need for
mixed data representation comes from practical necessity, the advantages of our
implementations are evaluated in the context of solving approximation and gap
recovery problems on synthetic data and real datasets.</span>

                                        <span>We derive a novel asymptotic problem-dependent lower-bound for regret
minimization in finite-horizon tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While,
similar to prior work (e.g., for ergodic MDPs), the lower-bound is the solution
to an optimization problem, our derivation reveals the need for an additional
constraint on the visitation distribution over state-action pairs that
explicitly accounts for the dynamics of the MDP. We provide a characterization
of our lower-bound through a series of examples illustrating how different MDPs
may have significantly different complexity. 1) We first consider a &quot;difficult&quot;
MDP instance, where the novel constraint based on the dynamics leads to a
larger lower-bound (i.e., a larger regret) compared to the classical analysis.
2) We then show that our lower-bound recovers results previously derived for
specific MDP instances. 3) Finally, we show that, in certain &quot;simple&quot; MDPs, the
lower bound is considerably smaller than in the general case and it does not
scale with the minimum action gap at all. We show that this last result is
attainable (up to $poly(H)$ terms, where $H$ is the horizon) by providing a
regret upper-bound based on policy gaps for an optimistic algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional networks are ubiquitous in deep learning. They are particularly
useful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training
time, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are
seriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real
neurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be
locally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot
be convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however,
significantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies
that use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here
we study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same
regularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react
similarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing
the network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal
vision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn&#x27;t remove
the performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a
locally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This
requires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of &quot;weight
sharing&quot;. This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly
convolutional performance on ImageNet, thus supporting convolutional networks
as a model of the visual stream.</span>

                                        <span>The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during
the past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning
from the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been
built to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto
diagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population
that satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is
scarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This
study presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic
pre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,
followed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The
semantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,
and the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware
fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter
modification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data
scarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small
patient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with
more than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream
tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic
pre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving
more than 10\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In
addition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer
learned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future
healthcare model pre-training across institutions.</span>

                                        <span>An agent that is capable of predicting what happens next can perform a
variety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore,
such an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world
and therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual
perception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video,
conditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting
task which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.
Existing video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow
benchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with
more complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of
evidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes
for the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient
use of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for
underfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which
is capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar
parameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the
consequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected
outcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data,
and how it can be mitigated using existing image augmentation techniques. As a
result, FitVid outperforms the current state-of-the-art models across four
different video prediction benchmarks on four different metrics.</span>

(ED) is to promptly identify the patients who will benefit from hospital
admission. Machine Learning (ML) techniques show promise as diagnostic aids in
healthcare. Material and methods: We investigated the following features
seeking to investigate their performance in predicting hospital admission:
serum levels of Urea, Creatinine, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Creatine Kinase,
C-Reactive Protein, Complete Blood Count with differential, Activated Partial
Thromboplastin Time, D Dimer, International Normalized Ratio, age, gender,
triage disposition to ED unit and ambulance utilization. A total of 3,204 ED
visits were analyzed. Results: The proposed algorithms generated models which
demonstrated acceptable performance in predicting hospital admission of ED
patients. The range of F-measure and ROC Area values of all eight evaluated
algorithms were [0.679-0.708] and [0.734-0.774], respectively. Discussion: The
main advantages of this tool include easy access, availability, yes/no result,
and low cost. The clinical implications of our approach might facilitate a
shift from traditional clinical decision-making to a more sophisticated model.
Conclusion: Developing robust prognostic models with the utilization of common
biomarkers is a project that might shape the future of emergency medicine. Our
findings warrant confirmation with implementation in pragmatic ED trials.</span>

superior lossy compression performance. However, distinct models are required
to be trained to reach different points in the rate-distortion (R-D) space. In
this paper, we consider the problem of R-D characteristic analysis and modeling
for NIC. We make efforts to formulate the essential mathematical functions to
describe the R-D behavior of NIC using deep network and statistical modeling.
Thus continuous bit-rate points could be elegantly realized by leveraging such
model via a single trained network. In this regard, we propose a plugin-in
module to learn the relationship between the target bit-rate and the binary
representation for the latent variable of auto-encoder. Furthermore, we model
the rate and distortion characteristic of NIC as a function of the coding
parameter $\lambda$ respectively. Our experiments show our proposed method is
easy to adopt and obtains competitive coding performance with fixed-rate coding
approaches, which would benefit the practical deployment of NIC. In addition,
the proposed model could be applied to NIC rate control with limited bit-rate
error using a single network.</span>

applications. These models come with a set of pre-trained weights typically
obtained in unsupervised/self-supervised modality on a huge amount of data.
After that, they are fine-tuned on a specific task. Applications then use these
models for inference, and often some additional constraints apply, like low
power-budget or low latency between input and output. The main avenue to meet
these additional requirements for the inference settings, is to use low
precision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost
of deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some
approaches have been developed to tackle the problem and go beyond the
limitations of the PTO (Post-Training Quantization), more specifically the QAT
(Quantization Aware Training, see [4]) is a procedure that interferes with the
training process in order to make it affected (or simply disturbed) by the
quantization phase during the training itself. Besides QAT, recently
Intel-Habana Labs have proposed an additional and more direct way to make the
training results more robust to subsequent quantization which uses a
regularizer, therefore changing the loss function that drives the training
procedure. But their proposal does not work out-of-the-box for pre-trained
models like Ernie, for example. In this short paper we show why this is not
happening (for the Ernie case) and we propose a very basic way to deal with it,
sharing as well some initial results (increase in final INT8 accuracy) that
might be of interest to practitioners willing to use Ernie in their
applications, in low precision regime.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Linear Models (NLM) are deep Bayesian models that produce predictive
uncertainty by learning features from the data and then performing Bayesian
linear regression over these features. Despite their popularity, few works have
focused on formally evaluating the predictive uncertainties of these models.
Furthermore, existing works point out the difficulties of encoding domain
knowledge in models like NLMs, making them unsuitable for applications where
interpretability is required. In this work, we show that traditional training
procedures for NLMs can drastically underestimate uncertainty in data-scarce
regions. We identify the underlying reasons for this behavior and propose a
novel training method that can both capture useful predictive uncertainties as
well as allow for incorporation of domain knowledge.</span>

learning is still far from being well understood. Motivated by this, we study
smooth Q-learning, a prototypical learning model that explicitly captures the
balance between game rewards and exploration costs. We show that Q-learning
always converges to the unique quantal-response equilibrium (QRE), the standard
solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted zero-sum
polymatrix games with heterogeneous learning agents using positive exploration
rates. Complementing recent results about convergence in weighted potential
games, we show that fast convergence of Q-learning in competitive settings is
obtained regardless of the number of agents and without any need for parameter
fine-tuning. As showcased by our experiments in network zero-sum games, these
theoretical results provide the necessary guarantees for an algorithmic
approach to the currently open problem of equilibrium selection in competitive
multi-agent settings.</span>

are an important tool for disease control. Neural networks are powerful
predictive models that have made contributions to many areas of public health.
In this systematic review, we provide an introduction to the neural networks
relevant to Dengue forecasting and review their applications in the literature.
The objective is to help inform model design for future work. Following the
PRISMA guidelines, we conduct a systematic search of studies that use neural
networks to forecast Dengue in human populations. We summarize the relative
performance of neural networks and comparator models, model architectures and
hyper-parameters, as well as choices of input features. Nineteen papers were
included. Most studies implement shallow neural networks using historical
Dengue incidence and meteorological input features. Prediction horizons tend to
be short. Building on the strengths of neural networks, most studies use
granular observations at the city or sub-national level. Performance of neural
networks relative to comparators such as Support Vector Machines varies across
study contexts. The studies suggest that neural networks can provide good
predictions of Dengue and should be included in the set of candidate models.
The use of convolutional, recurrent, or deep networks is relatively unexplored
but offers promising avenues for further research, as does the use of a broader
set of input features such as social media or mobile phone data.</span>

                                        <span>Markov Population Models are a widespread formalism used to model the
dynamics of complex systems, with applications in Systems Biology and many
other fields. The associated Markov stochastic process in continuous time is
often analyzed by simulation, which can be costly for large or stiff systems,
particularly when a massive number of simulations has to be performed (e.g. in
a multi-scale model). A strategy to reduce computational load is to abstract
the population model, replacing it with a simpler stochastic model, faster to
simulate. Here we pursue this idea, building on previous works and constructing
a generator capable of producing stochastic trajectories in continuous space
and discrete time. This generator is learned automatically from simulations of
the original model in a Generative Adversarial setting. Compared to previous
works, which rely on deep neural networks and Dirichlet processes, we explore
the use of state of the art generative models, which are flexible enough to
learn a full trajectory rather than a single transition kernel.</span>

difficulty in applying reinforcement learning to robotics is the high number of
experience samples required, being the use of simulated environments for
training the agents followed by transfer learning to real-world (sim-to-real) a
viable path. This article introduces an open-source simulator for the IEEE Very

learning experiments. We also propose a framework for creating OpenAI Gym
environments with a set of benchmarks tasks for evaluating single-agent and
multi-agent robot soccer skills. We then demonstrate the learning capabilities
of two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods as well as their
limitations in certain scenarios introduced in this framework. We believe this

                                        <span>Anime is quite well-received today, especially among the younger generations.
With many genres of available shows, more and more people are increasingly
getting attracted to this niche section of the entertainment industry. As anime
has recently garnered mainstream attention, we have insufficient information
regarding users&#x27; penchant and watching habits. Therefore, it is an uphill task
to build a recommendation engine for this relatively obscure entertainment
medium. In this attempt, we have built a novel hybrid recommendation system
that could act both as a recommendation system and as a means of exploring new
anime genres and titles. We have analyzed the general trends in this field and
the users&#x27; watching habits for coming up with our efficacious solution. Our
solution employs deep autoencoders for the tasks of predicting ratings and
generating embeddings. Following this, we formed clusters using the embeddings
of the anime titles. These clusters form the search space for anime with
similarities and are used to find anime similar to the ones liked and disliked
by the user. This method, combined with the predicted ratings, forms the novel
hybrid filter. In this article, we have demonstrated this idea and compared the
performance of our implemented model with the existing state-of-the-art
techniques.</span>

framework that can serve as a recipe for constructing and analyzing iterative
algorithms for convex optimization. Specifically, our work casts optimization
as iteratively playing a two-player zero-sum game. Many existing optimization
algorithms including Frank-Wolfe and Nesterov&#x27;s acceleration methods can be
recovered from the game by pitting two online learners with appropriate
strategies against each other. Furthermore, the sum of the weighted average
regrets of the players in the game implies the convergence rate. As a result,
our approach provides simple alternative proofs to these algorithms. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our approach of optimization as iteratively playing a game
leads to three new fast Frank-Wolfe-like algorithms for some constraint sets,
which further shows that our framework is indeed generic, modular, and
easy-to-use.

In the second part, we develop a modular analysis of provable acceleration
via Polyak&#x27;s momentum for certain problems, which include solving the classical
strongly quadratic convex problems, training a wide ReLU network under the
neural tangent kernel regime, and training a deep linear network with an
orthogonal initialization. We develop a meta theorem and show that when
applying Polyak&#x27;s momentum for these problems, the induced dynamics exhibit a
form where we can directly apply our meta theorem.

In the last part of the dissertation, we show another advantage of the use of
Polyak&#x27;s momentum -- it facilitates fast saddle point escape in smooth
non-convex optimization. This result, together with those of the second part,

                                        <span>The information bottleneck (IB) principle has been suggested as a way to
analyze deep neural networks. The learning dynamics are studied by inspecting
the mutual information (MI) between the hidden layers and the input and output.
Notably, separate fitting and compression phases during training have been
reported. This led to some controversy including claims that the observations
are not reproducible and strongly dependent on the type of activation function
used as well as on the way the MI is estimated. Our study confirms that
different ways of binning when computing the MI lead to qualitatively different
results, either supporting or refusing IB conjectures. To resolve the
controversy, we study the IB principle in settings where MI is non-trivial and
can be computed exactly. We monitor the dynamics of quantized neural networks,
that is, we discretize the whole deep learning system so that no approximation
is required when computing the MI. This allows us to quantify the information
flow without measurement errors. In this setting, we observed a fitting phase
for all layers and a compression phase for the output layer in all experiments;
the compression in the hidden layers was dependent on the type of activation
function. Our study shows that the initial IB results were not artifacts of
binning when computing the MI. However, the critical claim that the compression
phase may not be observed for some networks also holds true.</span>

                                        <span>Spatial-temporal forecasting has attracted tremendous attention in a wide
range of applications, and traffic flow prediction is a canonical and typical
example. The complex and long-range spatial-temporal correlations of traffic
flow bring it to a most intractable challenge. Existing works typically utilize
shallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to
model spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the
representation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are
incapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial
connections are considered and a mass of semantic connections are ignored,
which are of great importance for a comprehensive understanding of traffic
networks. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential
Equation Networks (STGODE). Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics
through a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result,
deeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized
synchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical
adjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal
dialated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal
dependencies. We evaluate our model on multiple real-world traffic datasets and
superior performance is achieved over state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on various tasks and
fields that require relational modeling. GNNs aggregate node features using the
graph structure as inductive biases resulting in flexible and powerful models.
However, GNNs remain hard to interpret as the interplay between node features
and graph structure is only implicitly learned. In this paper, we propose a
novel method called Kedge for explicitly sparsifying the underlying graph by
removing unnecessary neighbors. Our key idea is based on a tractable method for
sparsification using the Hard Kumaraswamy distribution that can be used in
conjugation with any GNN model. Kedge learns edge masks in a modular fashion
trained with any GNN allowing for gradient based optimization in an end-to-end
fashion. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model Kedge can
prune a large proportion of the edges with only a minor effect on the test
accuracy. Specifically, in the PubMed dataset, Kedge learns to drop more than
80% of the edges with an accuracy drop of merely 2% showing that graph
structure has only a small contribution in comparison to node features.
Finally, we also show that Kedge effectively counters the over-smoothing
phenomena in deep GNNs by maintaining good task performance with increasing GNN
layers.</span>

becomes impossible to identify parameters. For a chain with two hidden states

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

                                        <span>Whilst recent neural text-to-speech (TTS) approaches produce high-quality
speech, they typically require a large amount of recordings from the target
speaker. In previous work, a 3-step method was proposed to generate
high-quality TTS while greatly reducing the amount of data required for
training. However, we have observed a ceiling effect in the level of
naturalness achievable for highly expressive voices when using this approach.
In this paper, we present a method for building highly expressive TTS voices
with as little as 15 minutes of speech data from the target speaker. Compared
to the current state-of-the-art approach, our proposed improvements close the
gap to recordings by 23.3% for naturalness of speech and by 16.3% for speaker
similarity. Further, we match the naturalness and speaker similarity of a
Tacotron2-based full-data (~10 hours) model using only 15 minutes of target
speaker data, whereas with 30 minutes or more, we significantly outperform it.
The following improvements are proposed: 1) changing from an autoregressive,
attention-based TTS model to a non-autoregressive model replacing attention
with an external duration model and 2) an additional Conditional Generative
Adversarial Network (cGAN) based fine-tuning step.</span>

unsupervised machine learning. In recent years, many interests have been
attracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have
advantages of theoretical understandings of the expressive power using
entanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting the classical computation
and the quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing
tensor-network-based unsupervised models only work as a proof of principle, as
their performances are much worse than the standard models such as the
restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this work, we present the
Autoregressive Matrix Product States (AMPS), a tensor-network-based model
combining the matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and the
autoregressive models from machine learning. The model enjoys exact calculation
of normalized probability and unbiased sampling, as well as a clear theoretical
understanding of expressive power. We demonstrate the performance of our model
using two applications, the generative modeling on synthetic and real-world
data, and the reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive
numerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the existing tensor-network-based models and the restricted
Boltzmann machines, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural network
models.</span>

shared through news articles, company reports, and social media discussions.
Analyzing these vast sources of data can give market participants an edge to
make profit. However, the majority of the studies in the literature are based
on traditional approaches that come short in analyzing unstructured, vast
textual data. In this study, we provide a review on the immense amount of
existing literature of text-based stock market analysis. We present input data
types and cover main textual data sources and variations. Feature
representation techniques are then presented. Then, we cover the analysis
techniques and create a taxonomy of the main stock market forecast models.
Importantly, we discuss representative work in each category of the taxonomy,
analyzing their respective contributions. Finally, this paper shows the
findings on unaddressed open problems and gives suggestions for future work.
The aim of this study is to survey the main stock market analysis models, text
representation techniques for financial market prediction, shortcomings of
existing techniques, and propose promising directions for future research.</span>

negligible influence both on backpropagation and training. Yet, in the real
world, 32 bits default precision combined with the size of deep learning
problems makes it a hyperparameter of training methods. We investigate the
importance of the value of ReLU (0) for several precision levels (16, 32, 64
bits), on various networks (fully connected, VGG, ResNet) and datasets (MNIST,
CIFAR10, SVHN). We observe considerable variations of backpropagation outputs
which occur around half of the time in 32 bits precision. The effect disappears
with double precision, while it is systematic at 16 bits. For vanilla SGD
training, the choice ReLU (0) &#x3D; 0 seems to be the most efficient. We also
evidence that reconditioning approaches as batch-norm or ADAM tend to buffer
the influence of ReLU (0)&#x27;s value. Overall, the message we want to convey is
that algorithmic differentiation of nonsmooth problems potentially hides
parameters that could be tuned advantageously.</span>

military target detection, environmental monitoring, hazard prevention and
other time-critical applications require onboard real time processing
capabilities or autonomous decision making. Some unmanned remote systems like
satellites are physically remote from their operators, and all control of the
spacecraft and data returned by the spacecraft must be transmitted over a
wireless radio link. This link may not be available for extended periods when
the satellite is out of line of sight of its ground station. Therefore,
lightweight, small size and low power consumption hardware is essential for
onboard real time processing systems. With increasing dimensionality, size and
resolution of recent hyperspectral imaging sensors, additional challenges are
posed upon remote sensing processing systems and more capable computing
architectures are needed. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) emerged as
promising architecture for light weight high performance computing that can
address these computational requirements for onboard systems. The goal of this
study is to build high performance methods for onboard hyperspectral analysis.
We propose accelerated methods for the well-known recursive hierarchical
segmentation (RHSEG) clustering method, using GPUs, hybrid multicore CPU with a
GPU and hybrid multi-core CPU/GPU clusters. RHSEG is a method developed by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which is designed to
provide rich classification information with several output levels. The
achieved speedups by parallel solutions compared to CPU sequential
implementations are 21x for parallel single GPU and 240x for hybrid multi-node
computer clusters with 16 computing nodes. The energy consumption is reduced to
74% using a single GPU compared to the equivalent parallel CPU cluster.</span>

classification (XMC) problems due to their scalability to large output spaces
(e.g., millions or more). However, existing methods partition the large label
space into mutually exclusive clusters, which is sub-optimal when labels have
multi-modality and rich semantics. For instance, the label &quot;Apple&quot; can be the
fruit or the brand name, which leads to the following research question: can we
disentangle these multi-modal labels with non-exclusive clustering tailored for
downstream XMC tasks? In this paper, we show that the label assignment problem
in partition-based XMC can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the
objective of maximizing precision rates. This leads to an efficient algorithm
to form flexible and overlapped label clusters, and a method that can
alternatively optimizes the cluster assignments and the model parameters for
partition-based XMC. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show
that our method can successfully disentangle multi-modal labels, leading to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four XMC benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Data analysis plays an indispensable role for value creation in industry.
Cluster analysis in this context is able to explore given datasets with little
or no prior knowledge and to identify unknown patterns. As (big) data
complexity increases in the dimensions volume, variety, and velocity, this
becomes even more important. Many tools for cluster analysis have been
developed from early on and the variety of different clustering algorithms is
huge. As the selection of the right clustering procedure is crucial to the
results of the data analysis, users are in need for support on their journey of
extracting knowledge from raw data. Thus, the objective of this paper lies in
the identification of a systematic selection logic for clustering algorithms
and corresponding validation concepts. The goal is to enable potential users to
choose an algorithm that fits best to their needs and the properties of their
underlying data clustering problem. Moreover, users are supported in selecting
the right validation concepts to make sense of the clustering results. Based on
a comprehensive literature review, this paper provides assessment criteria for
clustering method evaluation and validation concept selection. The criteria are
applied to several common algorithms and the selection process of an algorithm
is supported by the introduction of pseudocode-based routines that consider the
underlying data structure.</span>

practice, monitoring, i.e. verifying that these operate within specification,
has become an important practical problem. An important aspect of this
monitoring is to check whether the inputs (or intermediates) have strayed from
the distribution they were validated for, which can void the performance
assurances obtained during testing.

There are two common approaches for this. The, perhaps, more classical one is
outlier detection or novelty detection, where, for a single input we ask
whether it is an outlier, i.e. exceedingly unlikely to have originated from a
reference distribution. The second, perhaps more recent approach, is to
consider a larger number of inputs and compare its distribution to a reference
distribution (e.g. sampled during testing). This is done under the label drift
detection.

In this work, we bridge the gap between outlier detection and drift detection
through comparing a given number of inputs to an automatically chosen part of
the reference distribution.</span>

component to allow attention-based deep model architectures such as Transformer
to address sequences or images where the position of information matters. In
this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding method based on learnable
Fourier features. Instead of hard-coding each position as a token or a vector,
we represent each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable
encoding based on learnable Fourier feature mapping, modulated with a
multi-layer perceptron. The representation is particularly advantageous for a
spatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where
$L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured.
Our experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable
Fourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding
outperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster
convergence.</span>

such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption
planning. This paper studies the \textit{long-term forecasting} problem of time
series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms
to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns
of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Towards these challenges, we propose Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We go
beyond the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as
a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with
progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired
by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism
based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and
representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term
forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative
improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,
traffic, economics, weather and disease.</span>

                                        <span>Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure
that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent
objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined
over many correlated outcomes (or &#x60;&#x60;tasks&quot;). For example, scientists may want
to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of
locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot
across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization.
However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic
surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of
outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for
exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in
the covariance matrices with Matheron&#x27;s identity, allowing us to perform
Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands
of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in
sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate
functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of
applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and
engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical
interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.</span>

setting constraints directly on state density functions, rather than the value
functions considered by previous works. State density has a clear physical and
mathematical interpretation, and is able to express a wide variety of
constraints such as resource limits and safety requirements. Density
constraints can also avoid the time-consuming process of designing and tuning
cost functions required by value function-based constraints to encode system
specifications. We leverage the duality between density functions and Q
functions to develop an effective algorithm to solve the density constrained RL
problem optimally and the constrains are guaranteed to be satisfied. We prove
that the proposed algorithm converges to a near-optimal solution with a bounded
error even when the policy update is imperfect. We use a set of comprehensive
experiments to demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art
CRL methods, with a wide range of density constrained tasks as well as standard
CRL benchmarks such as Safety-Gym.</span>

ranging from climate science to medicine, but overwhelming complexity stymies
insight. Existing theory is often not able to succinctly describe salient
phenomena, and progress has largely relied on ad hoc definitions of dynamical
regimes to guide and focus exploration. We present a formal definition in which
the identification of dynamical regimes is formulated as an optimization
problem, and we propose an intelligible objective function. Furthermore, we
propose an unsupervised learning framework which eliminates the need for a
priori knowledge and ad hoc definitions; instead, the user need only choose
appropriate clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms, and this choice
can be guided using our proposed objective function. We illustrate its
applicability with example problems drawn from ocean dynamics, tumor
angiogenesis, and turbulent boundary layers. Our method is a step towards
unbiased data exploration that allows serendipitous discovery within dynamical
systems, with the potential to propel the physical sciences forward.</span>

                                        <span>Despite rapid developments in the field of machine learning research,
collecting high-quality labels for supervised learning remains a bottleneck for
many applications. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that
state-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,
often increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.
Weak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and
reduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for
supervision. However, until recently, data programming was only accessible to
users who knew how to program. To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by
Demonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of
labeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This
framework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models
for document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to
span-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP
labeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for
annotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and
encourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and
active learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could
achieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling
for different span-level annotation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>In federated learning (FL), model training is distributed over clients and
local models are aggregated by a central server. The performance of uploaded
models in such situations can vary widely due to imbalanced data distributions,
potential demands on privacy protections, and quality of transmissions. In this
paper, we aim to minimize FL training delay over wireless channels, constrained
by overall training performance as well as each client&#x27;s differential privacy
(DP) requirement. We solve this problem in the framework of multi-agent
multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) to deal with the situation where there are multiple
clients confornting different unknown transmission environments, e.g., channel
fading and interferences. Specifically, we first transform the long-term
constraints on both training performance and each client&#x27;s DP into a virtual
queue based on the Lyapunov drift technique. Then, we convert the MAMAB to a
max-min bipartite matching problem at each communication round, by estimating
rewards with the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. More importantly, we
propose two efficient solutions to this matching problem, i.e., modified
Hungarian algorithm and greedy matching with a better alternative (GMBA), in
which the first one can achieve the optimal solution with a high complexity
while the second one approaches a better trade-off by enabling a verified
low-complexity with little performance loss. In addition, we develop an upper
bound on the expected regret of this MAMAB based FL framework, which shows a
linear growth over the logarithm of communication rounds, justifying its
theoretical feasibility. Extensive experimental results are conducted to
validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, and the impacts of
various parameters on the FL performance over wireless edge networks are also
discussed.</span>

on which they were trained they have a tendency to behave poorly, most
prominently over-confidence in erroneous predictions. Such behaviours will have
disastrous effects on real-world machine learning systems. In this field
graceful degradation refers to the optimisation of model performance as it
encounters this out-of-distribution data. This work presents a definition and
discussion of graceful degradation and where it can be applied in deployed
visual systems. Following this a survey of relevant areas is undertaken,
novelly splitting the graceful degradation problem into active and passive
approaches. In passive approaches, graceful degradation is handled and achieved
by the model in a self-contained manner, in active approaches the model is
updated upon encountering epistemic uncertainties. This work communicates the
importance of the problem and aims to prompt the development of machine
learning strategies that are aware of graceful degradation.</span>

competence for predicting continuous variables from inter-correlated brain
recordings in brain-computer interfaces, which achieved successful prediction
from epidural electrocorticography of macaques to three-dimensional continuous
hand trajectories recently. Nevertheless, PLSR is in essence formulated based
on the least square criterion, thus, being non-robust with respect to
complicated noises consequently. The aim of the present study is to propose a
robust version of PLSR. To this end, the maximum correntropy criterion is
adopted to structure a new robust variant of PLSR, namely Partial Maximum
Correntropy Regression (PMCR). Half-quadratic optimization technique is
utilized to calculate the robust latent variables. We assess the proposed PMCR
on a synthetic example and the public Neurotycho dataset. Compared with the
conventional PLSR and the state-of-the-art variant, PMCR realized superior
prediction competence on three different performance indicators with

approach for robust decoding from noisy brain measurements, which could reduce
the performance degradation resulting from adverse noises, thus, improving the

optimization problem over an intersection of multiple variable sets. This kind
of problems is typically solved by using an alternating minimization (AM)
strategy which splits the overall problem into a set of sub-problems
corresponding to each variable, and then iteratively performs minimization over
each sub-problem using a fixed updating rule. However, due to the intrinsic
non-convexity of the overall problem, the optimization can usually be trapped
into bad local minimum even when each sub-problem can be globally optimized at
each iteration. To tackle this problem, we propose a meta-learning based Global
Scope Optimization (GSO) method. It adaptively generates optimizers for
sub-problems via meta-learners and constantly updates these meta-learners with
respect to the global loss information of the overall problem. Therefore, the
sub-problems are optimized with the objective of minimizing the global loss
specifically. We evaluate the proposed model on a number of simulations,
including solving bi-linear inverse problems: matrix completion, and non-linear
problems: Gaussian mixture models. The experimental results show that our
proposed approach outperforms AM-based methods in standard settings, and is
able to achieve effective optimization in some challenging cases while other
methods would typically fail.</span>

                                        <span>Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is increasingly used to automatically tune
the predictive performance (e.g., accuracy) of machine learning models.
However, in a plethora of real-world applications, accuracy is only one of the
multiple -- often conflicting -- performance criteria, necessitating the
adoption of a multi-objective (MO) perspective. While the literature on MO
optimization is rich, few prior studies have focused on HPO. In this paper, we
propose algorithms that extend asynchronous successive halving (ASHA) to the MO
setting. Considering multiple evaluation metrics, we assess the performance of
these methods on three real world tasks: (i) Neural architecture search, (ii)
algorithmic fairness and (iii) language model optimization. Our empirical
analysis shows that MO ASHA enables to perform MO HPO at scale. Further, we
observe that that taking the entire Pareto front into account for candidate
selection consistently outperforms multi-fidelity HPO based on MO scalarization
in terms of wall-clock time. Our algorithms (to be open-sourced) establish new
baselines for future research in the area.</span>

                                        <span>The ability to plan into the future while utilizing only raw high-dimensional
observations, such as images, can provide autonomous agents with broad
capabilities. Visual model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that plan
future actions directly have shown impressive results on tasks that require
only short-horizon reasoning, however, these methods struggle on temporally
extended tasks. We argue that it is easier to solve long-horizon tasks by
planning sequences of states rather than just actions, as the effects of
actions greatly compound over time and are harder to optimize. To achieve this,
we draw on the idea of collocation, which has shown good results on
long-horizon tasks in optimal control literature, and adapt it to the
image-based setting by utilizing learned latent state space models. The
resulting latent collocation method (LatCo) optimizes trajectories of latent
states, which improves over previously proposed shooting methods for visual
model-based RL on tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals. Videos and

                                        <span>Spoken conversational question answering (SCQA) requires machines to model
complex dialogue flow given the speech utterances and text corpora. Different
from traditional text question answering (QA) tasks, SCQA involves audio signal
processing, passage comprehension, and contextual understanding. However, ASR
systems introduce unexpected noisy signals to the transcriptions, which result
in performance degradation on SCQA. To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,
a novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies
both cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized
embedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance
improvements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation
framework to distill the ASR-robust knowledge from the estimated probabilities
of the teacher model to the student. We conduct extensive experiments on the
Spoken-CoQA dataset and demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable
performance in this task.</span>

policy evaluation (OPE) problems with model-based methods (for episodic MDP)
and provides a unified framework towards optimal learning for several
well-motivated offline tasks. Uniform OPE
$\sup_\Pi|Q^\pi-\hat{Q}^\pi|&lt;\epsilon$ is a stronger measure than the
point-wise OPE and ensures offline learning when $\Pi$ contains all policies
(the global class). In this paper, we establish an $\Omega(H^2
S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ lower bound (over model-based family) for the global uniform
OPE and our main result establishes an upper bound of
$\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ for the \emph{local} uniform convergence that
applies to all \emph{near-empirically optimal} policies for the MDPs with
\emph{stationary} transition. Here $d_m$ is the minimal marginal state-action
probability. Critically, the highlight in achieving the optimal rate
$\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ is our design of \emph{singleton absorbing MDP},
which is a new sharp analysis tool that works with the model-based approach. We
generalize such a model-based framework to the new settings: offline
task-agnostic and the offline reward-free with optimal complexity
$\tilde{O}(H^2\log(K)/d_m\epsilon^2)$ ($K$ is the number of tasks) and
$\tilde{O}(H^2S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ respectively. These results provide a unified
solution for simultaneously solving different offline RL problems.</span>

                                        <span>The difficulty of deterministic planning increases exponentially with
search-tree depth. Black-box planning presents an even greater challenge, since
planners must operate without an explicit model of the domain. Heuristics can
make search more efficient, but goal-aware heuristics for black-box planning
usually rely on goal counting, which is often quite uninformative. In this
work, we show how to overcome this limitation by discovering macro-actions that
make the goal-count heuristic more accurate. Our approach searches for
macro-actions with focused effects (i.e. macros that modify only a small number
of state variables), which align well with the assumptions made by the
goal-count heuristic. Focused macros dramatically improve black-box planning
efficiency across a wide range of planning domains, sometimes beating even
state-of-the-art planners with access to a full domain model.</span>

agriculture commodity price prediction system with novel machine learning
techniques. Due to the increasing large amounts historical data of agricultural
commodity prices and the need of performing accurate prediction of price
fluctuations, the solution has largely shifted from statistical methods to
machine learning area. However, the selection of proper set from historical
data for forecasting still has limited consideration. On the other hand, when
implementing machine learning techniques, finding a suitable model with optimal
parameters for global solution, nonlinearity and avoiding curse of
dimensionality are still biggest challenges, therefore machine learning
strategies study are needed. In this research, we propose a web-based automated
system to predict agriculture commodity price. In the two series experiments,
five popular machine learning algorithms, ARIMA, SVR, Prophet, XGBoost and LSTM
have been compared with large historical datasets in Malaysia and the most
optimal algorithm, LSTM model with an average of 0.304 mean-square error has

other fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However,
success always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are
data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the
medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning
to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis
are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also
require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it
difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large
medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a
collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep
learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred
datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized
them into four categories: head &amp; neck, chest &amp; abdomen, pathology &amp; blood, and
&#x60;&#x60;others&#x27;&#x27;. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and
complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the
datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the
methodology to test and evaluate their methods&#x27; performance and robustness on
relevant datasets, 3) to provide a &#x60;&#x60;route&#x27;&#x27; to relevant algorithms for the
relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding and explaining the mistakes made by trained models is critical
to many machine learning objectives, such as improving robustness, addressing
concept drift, and mitigating biases. However, this is often an ad hoc process
that involves manually looking at the model&#x27;s mistakes on many test samples and
guessing at the underlying reasons for those incorrect predictions. In this
paper, we propose a systematic approach, conceptual explanation scores (CES),
that explains why a classifier makes a mistake on a particular test sample(s)
in terms of human-understandable concepts (e.g. this zebra is misclassified as
a dog because of faint stripes). We base CES on two prior ideas: counterfactual
explanations and concept activation vectors, and validate our approach on
well-known pretrained models, showing that it explains the models&#x27; mistakes
meaningfully. We also train new models with intentional and known spurious
correlations, which CES successfully identifies from a single misclassified
test sample. The code for CES is publicly available and can easily be applied
to new models.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control
and generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models,
however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning.
This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot
dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of
many robots, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, are described
in terms of their SE(3) pose and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation
of energy principles. This paper proposes a Hamiltonian formulation over the
SE(3) manifold of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation
(ODE) network to approximate the dynamics of a rigid body. In contrast to a
black-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees total energy conservation by
construction. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the
learned, potentially under-actuated SE(3) Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a
unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various
platforms, including pendulum, rigid-body, and quadrotor systems.</span>

                                        <span>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential of utilizing
near-term quantum machines to gain certain computational advantages over
classical methods. Nevertheless, modern VQAs suffer from cumbersome
computational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary
quantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the
superiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime
efficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called
QUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central
server partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate
them to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor
and a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes
proceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes
optimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a
sublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration
under the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent
optimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO
can surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the
number of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced
VQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and
applications with quantum advantage.</span>

latent representations to be used by the policy and value function with the
hopes for a more stable and sample-efficient optimization. However, such a
paradigm present a number of challenges in practice, as parameters generating a
shared representation must learn off two distinct objectives, resulting in
competing updates and learning perturbations. In this paper, we present a novel
feature-sharing framework to address these difficulties by introducing the mix
and mask mechanisms and the distributional scalarization technique. These
mechanisms behaves dynamically to couple and decouple connected latent features
variably between the policy and value function, while the distributional
scalarization standardizes the two objectives using a probabilistic standpoint.
From our experimental results, we demonstrate significant performance
improvements compared to alternative methods using separate networks and
networks with a shared backbone.</span>

the countries which are converging and used those for training the network. We
utilized the SARIMAX, Linear regression model to anticipate new suspected

                                        <span>Successful quantitative investment usually relies on precise predictions of
the future movement of the stock price. Recently, machine learning based
solutions have shown their capacity to give more accurate stock prediction and
become indispensable components in modern quantitative investment systems.
However, the i.i.d. assumption behind existing methods is inconsistent with the
existence of diverse trading patterns in the stock market, which inevitably
limits their ability to achieve better stock prediction performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to
empower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple
stock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists
of a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a
router to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of
explicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective
TRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning
algorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to
predictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment
through an auxiliary loss term. Experiments on the real-world stock ranking
task show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., Attention LSTM
and Transformer, the proposed method can improve information coefficient (IC)
from 0.053 to 0.059 and 0.051 to 0.056 respectively. Our dataset and code used

                                        <span>The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an efficient simulation technique for
computational fluid mechanics and beyond. It is based on a simple
stream-and-collide algorithm on Cartesian grids, which is easily compatible
with modern machine learning architectures. While it is becoming increasingly
clear that deep learning can provide a decisive stimulus for classical
simulation techniques, recent studies have not addressed possible connections
between machine learning and LBM. Here, we introduce Lettuce, a PyTorch-based
LBM code with a threefold aim. Lettuce enables GPU accelerated calculations
with minimal source code, facilitates rapid prototyping of LBM models, and
enables integrating LBM simulations with PyTorch&#x27;s deep learning and automatic
differentiation facility. As a proof of concept for combining machine learning
with the LBM, a neural collision model is developed, trained on a doubly
periodic shear layer and then transferred to a different flow, a decaying
turbulence. We also exemplify the added benefit of PyTorch&#x27;s automatic
differentiation framework in flow control and optimization. To this end, the
spectrum of a forced isotropic turbulence is maintained without further
constraining the velocity field. The source code is freely available from

                                        <span>Normalizing flows are prominent deep generative models that provide tractable
probability distributions and efficient density estimation. However, they are
well known to fail while detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs as they
directly encode the local features of the input representations in their latent
space. In this paper, we solve this overconfidence issue of normalizing flows
by demonstrating that flows, if extended by an attention mechanism, can
reliably detect outliers including adversarial attacks. Our approach does not
require outlier data for training and we showcase the efficiency of our method
for OOD detection by reporting state-of-the-art performance in diverse
experimental settings. Code available at

                                        <span>Containerization is a lightweight application virtualization technology,
providing high environmental consistency, operating system distribution
portability, and resource isolation. Existing mainstream cloud service
providers have prevalently adopted container technologies in their distributed
system infrastructures for automated application management. To handle the
automation of deployment, maintenance, autoscaling, and networking of
containerized applications, container orchestration is proposed as an essential
research problem. However, the highly dynamic and diverse feature of cloud
workloads and environments considerably raises the complexity of orchestration
mechanisms. Machine learning algorithms are accordingly employed by container
orchestration systems for behavior modelling and prediction of
multi-dimensional performance metrics. Such insights could further improve the
quality of resource provisioning decisions in response to the changing
workloads under complex environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
literature review of existing machine learning-based container orchestration
approaches. Detailed taxonomies are proposed to classify the current researches
by their common features. Moreover, the evolution of machine learning-based
container orchestration technologies from the year 2016 to 2021 has been
designed based on objectives and metrics. A comparative analysis of the
reviewed techniques is conducted according to the proposed taxonomies, with
emphasis on their key characteristics. Finally, various open research
challenges and potential future directions are highlighted.</span>

                                        <span>In reacting flow systems, thermoacoustic instability characterized by high
amplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the
unsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the
underlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied
and the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure
oscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,
during the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the
system dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations
via a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled
by coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,
each estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the
flame, to acoustic fluctuations are characterized by introducing external
unsteady forcing. This necessitates a powerful excitation module to obtain the
nonlinear response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. Instead of
characterizing individual subsystems, we introduce a neural ordinary
differential equation (neural ODE) framework to model the thermoacoustic system
as a whole. The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series
of the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously
without introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled
interaction. Further, we use the parameters of neural ODE to define an anomaly
measure that represents the proximity of system dynamics to limit cycle
oscillations and thus provide an early warning signal for the onset of
thermoacoustic instability.</span>

data distribution is essential for real-world problems but extremely
challenging for modern deep learning. In this work we propose HCL, a Hybrid
generative-discriminative approach to Continual Learning for classification. We
model the distribution of each task and each class with a normalizing flow. The
flow is used to learn the data distribution, perform classification, identify
task changes, and avoid forgetting, all leveraging the invertibility and exact
likelihood which are uniquely enabled by the normalizing flow model. We use the
generative capabilities of the flow to avoid catastrophic forgetting through
generative replay and a novel functional regularization technique. For task
identification, we use state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques based on
measuring the typicality of the model&#x27;s statistics. We demonstrate the strong
performance of HCL on a range of continual learning benchmarks such as
split-MNIST, split-CIFAR, and SVHN-MNIST.</span>

three measuring utility in terms of Wasserstein distance between the true
cluster centers and the centers returned by the private algorithm. In this work
we improve upon this line of works on multiple axes. We present a far simpler
algorithm for clustering stable inputs (not relying on the sample-and-aggregate

k-means cost. Moreover, our algorithm has straight-forward analogues for &quot;nice&quot;

automated data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, semantic data type
normalization and sensitive data identification. Existing methods include
regular expression-based or dictionary lookup-based methods that are not robust
to dirty as well unseen data and are limited to a very less number of semantic
data types to predict. Existing Machine Learning methods extract large number
of engineered features from data and build logistic regression, random forest

DCoM, a collection of multi-input NLP-based deep neural networks to detect
semantic data types where instead of extracting large number of features from
the data, we feed the raw values of columns (or instances) to the model as
texts. We train DCoM on 686,765 data columns extracted from VizNet corpus with
78 different semantic data types. DCoM outperforms other contemporary results

modeling, but its serial dependency hinders the computation parallelization,
which makes the operation inefficient. The same problem was encountered in
serial adder at the early stage of digital electronics. In this paper, we
discuss the similarities between recurrent neural network (RNN) and serial
adder. Inspired by carry-lookahead adder, we introduce carry-lookahead module
to RNN, which makes it possible for RNN to run in parallel. Then, we design the
method of parallel RNN computation, and finally Carry-lookahead RNN (CL-RNN) is
proposed. CL-RNN takes advantages in parallelism and flexible receptive field.
Through a comprehensive set of tests, we verify that CL-RNN can perform better

exhibit strong homophily with respect to the node labels i.e. connected nodes
have same labels. However, they perform poorly on heterophilic graphs. Recent
approaches have typically modified aggregation schemes, designed adaptive graph
filters, etc. to address this limitation. In spite of this, the performance on
heterophilic graphs can still be poor. We propose a simple alternative method
that exploits Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) of topological
structure and node features. Our approach achieves up to ~30% improvement in
performance over state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs. This work is
an early investigation into methods that differ from aggregation based
approaches. Our experimental results suggest that it might be important to
explore other alternatives to aggregation methods for heterophilic setting.</span>

developers rely on quantitative metrics of the predictions to evaluate a GNN,

understand if the GNN truly learns characteristics of a graph as expected. We
propose an approach to corresponding an input graph to its node embedding (aka
latent space), a common component of GNNs that is later used for prediction. We
abstract the data and tasks, and develop an interactive multi-view interface
called CorGIE to instantiate the abstraction. As the key function in CorGIE, we
propose the K-hop graph layout to show topological neighbors in hops and their
clustering structure. To evaluate the functionality and usability of CorGIE, we
present how to use CorGIE in two usage scenarios, and conduct a case study with

learning (MARL) based upon any nonlinear function of the team&#x27;s long-term

Reward {\bf A}ctor-{\bf C}ritic (DSAC) in which agents alternate between policy
evaluation (critic), weighted averaging with neighbors (information mixing),
and local gradient updates for their policy parameters (actor). DSAC augments
the classic critic step by requiring agents to (i) estimate their local
occupancy measure in order to (ii) estimate the derivative of the local utility
with respect to their occupancy measure, i.e., the &quot;shadow reward&quot;. DSAC
converges to $\epsilon$-stationarity in $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{2.5})$
(Theorem \ref{theorem:final}) or faster $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{2})$
(Corollary \ref{corollary:communication}) steps with high probability,
depending on the amount of communications. We further establish the
non-existence of spurious stationary points for this problem, that is, DSAC
finds the globally optimal policy (Corollary \ref{corollary:global}).

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) emerged recently as a standard toolkit for
learning from data on graphs. Current GNN designing works depend on immense
human expertise to explore different message-passing mechanisms, and require
manual enumeration to determine the proper message-passing depth. Inspired by
the strong searching capability of neural architecture search (NAS) in CNN,
this paper proposes Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) with novel-designed
search space. The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the
optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph
Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and
two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering and neighbor
aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network
search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and
neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors&#x27;
statistics. Experiments show that our GNAS can search for better GNNs with
multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth. The
searched network achieves remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art manual
designed and search-based GNNs on five large-scale datasets at three classical
graph tasks. Codes can be found at https://github.com/phython96/GNAS-MP.</span>

                                        <span>The computation and memory needed for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
inference can be reduced by pruning weights from the trained network. Pruning
is guided by a pruning saliency, which heuristically approximates the change in
the loss function associated with the removal of specific weights. Many pruning
signals have been proposed, but the performance of each heuristic depends on
the particular trained network. This leaves the data scientist with a difficult
choice. When using any one saliency metric for the entire pruning process, we
run the risk of the metric assumptions being invalidated, leading to poor
decisions being made by the metric. Ideally we could combine the best aspects
of different saliency metrics. However, despite an extensive literature review,
we are unable to find any prior work on composing different saliency metrics.
The chief difficulty lies in combining the numerical output of different
saliency metrics, which are not directly comparable.

We propose a method to compose several primitive pruning saliencies, to
exploit the cases where each saliency measure does well. Our experiments show
that the composition of saliencies avoids many poor pruning choices identified
by individual saliencies. In most cases our method finds better selections than
even the best individual pruning saliency.</span>

curves and associated area under the curve (AUC) measures constitute powerful
tools for assessing the predictive abilities of features, markers and tests in
binary classification problems. Despite its immense popularity, ROC analysis
has been subject to a fundamental restriction, in that it applies to
dichotomous (yes or no) outcomes only. Here we introduce ROC movies and
universal ROC (UROC) curves that apply to just any linearly ordered outcome,
along with an associated coefficient of predictive ability (CPA) measure. CPA
equals the area under the UROC curve, and admits appealing interpretations in
terms of probabilities and rank based covariances. For binary outcomes CPA
equals AUC, and for pairwise distinct outcomes CPA relates linearly to
Spearman&#x27;s coefficient, in the same way that the C index relates linearly to
Kendall&#x27;s coefficient. ROC movies, UROC curves, and CPA nest and generalize the
tools of classical ROC analysis, and are bound to supersede them in a wealth of

CNN models have been found vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations
(UAPs), which are small and example-independent, yet powerful enough to degrade

proposes a novel total loss minimization (TLM) approach to generate UAPs for

three popular CNN classifiers for both target and non-target attacks. We also
verified the transferability of UAPs in EEG-based BCI systems. To our
knowledge, this is the first study on UAPs of CNN classifiers in EEG-based
BCIs. UAPs are easy to construct, and can attack BCIs in real-time, exposing a
potentially critical security concern of BCIs.</span>

provided many opportunities to further enhance the safety, stability, and
accuracy of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). As indispensable
components to many mission-critical CPS assets and equipment, mechanical
bearings need to be monitored to identify any trace of abnormal conditions.
Most of the data-driven approaches applied to bearing fault diagnosis
up-to-date are trained using a large amount of fault data collected a priori.
In many practical applications, however, it can be unsafe and time-consuming to
collect sufficient data samples for each fault category, making it challenging
to train a robust classifier. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning
framework for bearing fault diagnosis based on model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML), which targets for training an effective fault classifier using limited
data. In addition, it can leverage the training data and learn to identify new
fault scenarios more efficiently. Case studies on the generalization to new
artificial faults show that the proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy
up to 25% higher than a Siamese network-based benchmark study. Finally, the
robustness and the generalization capability of the proposed framework are
further validated by applying it to identify real bearing damages using data
from artificial damages, which compares favorably against 6 state-of-the-art
few-shot learning algorithms using consistent test environments.</span>

competitors, reduce costs and respect delivery dates. With regard to PPC,
Machine Learning (ML) provides new opportunities to make intelligent decisions
based on data. Therefore, this communication provides an initial systematic
review of publications on ML applied in PPC. The research objective of this
study is twofold: firstly, it aims to identify techniques and tools allowing to
apply ML in PPC, and secondly, it reviews the characteristics of Industry 4.0
(I4.0) in recent research papers. Concerning the second objective, seven
characteristics of I4.0 are used in the analysis framework, from which two of
them are proposed by the authors. Additionally, the addressed domains of
ML-aided PPC in scientific literature are identified. Finally, results are
analyzed and gaps that may motivate further research are highlighted.</span>

                                        <span>Since the first coronavirus case was identified in the U.S. on Jan. 21, more
than 1 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of COVID-19. This
infectious respiratory disease has spread rapidly across more than 3000
counties and 50 states in the U.S. and have exhibited evolutionary clustering
and complex triggering patterns. It is essential to understand the complex
spacetime intertwined propagation of this disease so that accurate prediction
or smart external intervention can be carried out. In this paper, we model the
propagation of the COVID-19 as spatio-temporal point processes and propose a
generative and intensity-free model to track the spread of the disease. We
further adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn
the model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based
learning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify
an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover,
the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral
involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more
scalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning
performance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social
distancing policy based on the learned generative model.</span>

sensing, appear in a broad range of applications. In this work we present GNMR
-- an extremely simple iterative algorithm for low rank matrix recovery, based
on a Gauss-Newton linearization. On the theoretical front, we derive recovery
guarantees for GNMR in both the matrix sensing and matrix completion settings.
A key property of GNMR is that it implicitly keeps the factor matrices
approximately balanced throughout its iterations. On the empirical front, we
show that for matrix completion with uniform sampling, GNMR performs better
than several popular methods, especially when given very few observations close

                                        <span>Radiographs are used as the most important imaging tool for identifying spine
anomalies in clinical practice. The evaluation of spinal bone lesions, however,
is a challenging task for radiologists. This work aims at developing and
evaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the
classification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we
build a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies,
each of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding
boxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then
train a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal
and a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The
VinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies,
which is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%,
90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision
(mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task. These results serve
as a proof of concept and set a baseline for future research in this direction.
To encourage advances, the dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models are
made publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for
training monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results
on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised
methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are
common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:
abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for
images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more
generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel
Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction
error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in
untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured
areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show
that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without
any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.
Secondly, we show that training with an application&#x27;s representative rotations,
in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over
the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is
successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets
with no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of
self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Sketching uses randomized Hash functions for dimensionality reduction and
acceleration. The existing sketching methods, such as count sketch (CS), tensor
sketch (TS), and higher-order count sketch (HCS), either suffer from low
accuracy or slow speed in some tensor based applications. In this paper, the
proposed fast count sketch (FCS) applies multiple shorter Hash functions based
CS to the vector form of the input tensor, which is more accurate than TS since
the spatial information of the input tensor can be preserved more sufficiently.
When the input tensor admits CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD), FCS can
accelerate CS and HCS by using fast Fourier transform, which exhibits a
computational complexity asymptotically identical to TS for low-order tensors.
The effectiveness of FCS is validated by CPD, tensor regression network
compression, and Kronecker product compression. Experimental results show its
superior performance in terms of approximation accuracy and computational
efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Designing novel protein sequences for a desired 3D topological fold is a
fundamental yet non-trivial task in protein engineering. Challenges exist due
to the complex sequence--fold relationship, as well as the difficulties to
capture the diversity of the sequences (therefore structures and functions)
within a fold. To overcome these challenges, we propose Fold2Seq, a novel
transformer-based generative framework for designing protein sequences
conditioned on a specific target fold. To model the complex sequence--structure
relationship, Fold2Seq jointly learns a sequence embedding using a transformer
and a fold embedding from the density of secondary structural elements in 3D
voxels. On test sets with single, high-resolution and complete structure inputs
for individual folds, our experiments demonstrate improved or comparable
performance of Fold2Seq in terms of speed, coverage, and reliability for
sequence design, when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods that
include data-driven deep generative models and physics-based RosettaDesign. The
unique advantages of fold-based Fold2Seq, in comparison to a structure-based
deep model and RosettaDesign, become more evident on three additional
real-world challenges originating from low-quality, incomplete, or ambiguous
input structures. Source code and data are available at

Networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive at the point where the training
time could take days unless the number of layers, the number of training images
or the size of the training images are reduced. The image size of 256x256
pixels is commonly used for most of the applications of CNN, but this image
size is too small for applications like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
classification where the image details are important for accurate
classification. This research proposed Frequency Domain Convolution (FDC) and
Frequency Domain Pooling (FDP) layers which were built with RFFT, kernel
initialization strategy, convolution artifact removal and Channel Independent
Convolution (CIC) to replace the conventional convolution and pooling layers.
The FDC and FDP layers are used to build a Frequency Domain Convolutional
Neural Network (FDCNN) to accelerate the training of large images for DR
classification. The Full FDC layer is an extension of the FDC layer to allow
direct use in conventional CNNs, it is also used to modify the VGG16
architecture. FDCNN is shown to be at least 54.21% faster and 70.74% more
memory efficient compared to an equivalent CNN architecture. The modified VGG16

has found many applications in financial services ranging from fund recommender
systems, competitors analysis, portfolio analytics, marketing and sales, etc.
The traditional methods are either qualitative, and hence prone to biases and
often not reproducible, or, are known not to capture all the nuances
(non-linearities) among the portfolios from the raw data. We propose a
radically new approach to identify similar funds based on the weighted
bipartite network representation of funds and their underlying assets data
using a sophisticated machine learning method called Node2Vec which learns an
embedded low-dimensional representation of the network. We call the embedding
\emph{Fund2Vec}. Ours is the first ever study of the weighted bipartite network
representation of the funds-assets network in its original form that identifies
structural similarity among portfolios as opposed to merely portfolio overlaps.</span>

to detect the initial intrusion on IoT devices prior to massive attacks. Recent
studies have utilized power side-channel information to characterize this
intrusion behavior on IoT devices but still lack real-time detection
approaches. This study aimed to design an online intrusion detection system
called DeepAuditor for IoT devices via power auditing. To realize the real-time

Auditor. With the Power Auditor, we developed a Distributed CNN classifier for
online inference in our laboratory setting. In order to protect data leakage
and reduce networking redundancy, we also proposed a privacy-preserved
inference protocol via Packed Homomorphic Encryption and a sliding window
protocol in our system. The classification accuracy and processing time were
measured in our laboratory settings. We also demonstrated that the distributed
CNN design is secure against any distributed components. Overall, the
measurements were shown to the feasibility of our real-time distributed system

bounds on the regret. In this work, we initiate the study of best-case lower
bounds in online convex optimization, wherein we bound the largest improvement
an algorithm can obtain relative to the single best action in hindsight. This
problem is motivated by the goal of better understanding the adaptivity of a
learning algorithm. Another motivation comes from fairness: it is known that
best-case lower bounds are instrumental in obtaining algorithms for
decision-theoretic online learning (DTOL) that satisfy a notion of group
fairness. Our contributions are a general method to provide best-case lower
bounds in Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithms with time-varying
regularizers, which we use to show that best-case lower bounds are of the same
order as existing upper regret bounds: this includes situations with a fixed
learning rate, decreasing learning rates, timeless methods, and adaptive
gradient methods. In stark contrast, we show that the linearized version of
FTRL can attain negative linear regret. Finally, in DTOL with two experts and
binary predictions, we fully characterize the best-case sequences, which
provides a finer understanding of the best-case lower bounds.</span>

accordingly, in contrast to the classical LSTM solution. Due to its
flexibility, the new LSTM scheme is less prone to overfitting, and hence can
approximate time dependent solutions by use of a smaller data set. On a
structural nonlinear finite element application we show that the
self-regulating framework does not require prior knowledge of a suitable
network architecture and size, while ensuring satisfying accuracy at reasonable
computational cost.</span>

obtain predictive extrapolation, and recent works have imposed
Hamiltonian/Lagrangian form to preserve structure for systems with reversible
dynamics. In this work we present a novel parameterization of dissipative
brackets from metriplectic dynamical systems appropriate for learning
irreversible dynamics with unknown a priori model form. The process learns
generalized Casimirs for energy and entropy guaranteed to be conserved and
nondecreasing, respectively. Furthermore, for the case of added thermal noise,
we guarantee exact preservation of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem, ensuring
thermodynamic consistency. We provide benchmarks for dissipative systems
demonstrating learned dynamics are more robust and generalize better than
either &quot;black-box&quot; or penalty-based approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Existing bias mitigation methods for DNN models primarily work on learning
debiased encoders. This process not only requires a lot of instance-level
annotations for sensitive attributes, it also does not guarantee that all
fairness sensitive information has been removed from the encoder. To address
these limitations, we explore the following research question: Can we reduce
the discrimination of DNN models by only debiasing the classification head,
even with biased representations as inputs? To this end, we propose a new
mitigation technique, namely, Representation Neutralization for Fairness (RNF)
that achieves fairness by debiasing only the task-specific classification head
of DNN models. To this end, we leverage samples with the same ground-truth
label but different sensitive attributes, and use their neutralized
representations to train the classification head of the DNN model. The key idea
of RNF is to discourage the classification head from capturing spurious
correlation between fairness sensitive information in encoder representations
with specific class labels. To address low-resource settings with no access to
sensitive attribute annotations, we leverage a bias-amplified model to generate
proxy annotations for sensitive attributes. Experimental results over several
benchmark datasets demonstrate our RNF framework to effectively reduce
discrimination of DNN models with minimal degradation in task-specific
performance.</span>

                                        <span>We examine the general problem of inter-domain Gaussian Processes (GPs):
problems where the GP realization and the noisy observations of that
realization lie on different domains. When the mapping between those domains is
linear, such as integration or differentiation, inference is still closed form.
However, many of the scaling and approximation techniques that our community
has developed do not apply to this setting. In this work, we introduce the
hierarchical inducing point GP (HIP-GP), a scalable inter-domain GP inference
method that enables us to improve the approximation accuracy by increasing the
number of inducing points to the millions. HIP-GP, which relies on inducing
points with grid structure and a stationary kernel assumption, is suitable for
low-dimensional problems. In developing HIP-GP, we introduce (1) a fast
whitening strategy, and (2) a novel preconditioner for conjugate gradients
which can be helpful in general GP settings. Our code is available at https:

the explicit goal of estimating continuous-time gradients, we are able to

collaborative filtering algorithms -- play a crucial role in mediating our
access to online information. We show that such algorithms induce a particular
kind of stereotyping: if preferences for a \textit{set} of items are
anti-correlated in the general user population, then those items may not be
recommended together to a user, regardless of that user&#x27;s preferences and
ratings history. First, we introduce a notion of \textit{joint accessibility},
which measures the extent to which a set of items can jointly be accessed by
users. We then study joint accessibility under the standard factorization-based
collaborative filtering framework, and provide theoretical necessary and
sufficient conditions when joint accessibility is violated. Moreover, we show
that these conditions can easily be violated when the users are represented by
a single feature vector. To improve joint accessibility, we further propose an
alternative modelling fix, which is designed to capture the diverse multiple
interests of each user using a multi-vector representation. We conduct
extensive experiments on real and simulated datasets, demonstrating the
stereotyping problem with standard single-vector matrix factorization models.</span>

adaptation problems from a source language task distribution to an unknown
target language task distribution, assuming no training label in the target
language. At its core, UXLA performs simultaneous self-training with data
augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. To show its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on three diverse zero-resource cross-lingual

                                        <span>Although neural networks are widely used, it remains challenging to formally
verify the safety and robustness of neural networks in real-world applications.
Existing methods are designed to verify the network before use, which is
limited to relatively simple specifications and fixed networks. These methods
are not ready to be applied to real-world problems with complex and/or
dynamically changing specifications and networks. To effectively handle
dynamically changing specifications and networks, the verification needs to be
performed online when these changes take place. However, it is still
challenging to run existing verification algorithms online. Our key insight is
that we can leverage the temporal dependencies of these changes to accelerate
the verification process, e.g., by warm starting new online verification using
previous verified results. This paper establishes a novel framework for
scalable online verification to solve real-world verification problems with
dynamically changing specifications and/or networks, known as domain shift and
weight shift respectively. We propose three types of techniques (branch
management, perturbation tolerance analysis, and incremental computation) to
accelerate the online verification of deep neural networks. Experiment results
show that our online verification algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude
faster than existing verification algorithms, and thus can scale to real-world
applications.</span>

probabilistic models for predictive modeling as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), and for generative modeling as continuous normalizing flows.
In this work, we design a framework to decipher the internal dynamics of these
continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures. Our empirical
results suggest that pruning improves generalization for neural ODEs in
generative modeling. Moreover, pruning finds minimal and efficient neural ODE
representations with up to 98\% less parameters compared to the original
network, without loss of accuracy. Finally, we show that by applying pruning we
can obtain insightful information about the design of better neural ODEs.We
hope our results will invigorate further research into the performance-size
trade-offs of modern continuous-depth models.</span>

estimation with deep learning. Using neural networks as surrogates for Bayesian
posterior distributions, we analyze eight gravitational-wave events from the
first LIGO-Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog and find very close
quantitative agreement with standard inference codes, but with inference times
reduced from O(day) to a minute per event. Our networks are trained using
simulated data, including an estimate of the detector-noise characteristics
near the event. This encodes the signal and noise models within millions of
neural-network parameters, and enables inference for any observed data
consistent with the training distribution, accounting for noise nonstationarity
from event to event. Our algorithm -- called &quot;DINGO&quot; -- sets a new standard in
fast-and-accurate inference of physical parameters of detected
gravitational-wave events, which should enable real-time data analysis without

                                        <span>In this paper, a novel and robust algorithm is proposed for adaptive
beamforming based on the idea of reconstructing the autocorrelation sequence
(ACS) of a random process from a set of measured data. This is obtained from
the first column and the first row of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) after
averaging along its diagonals. Then, the power spectrum of the correlation
sequence is estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT
coefficients corresponding to the angles within the noise-plus-interference
region are used to reconstruct the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix
(NPICM), while the desired signal covariance matrix (DSCM) is estimated by
identifying and removing the noise-plus-interference component from the SCM. In
particular, the spatial power spectrum of the estimated received signal is
utilized to compute the correlation sequence corresponding to the
noise-plus-interference in which the dominant DFT coefficient of the
noise-plus-interference is captured. A key advantage of the proposed adaptive
beamforming is that only little prior information is required. Specifically, an
imprecise knowledge of the array geometry and of the angular sectors in which
the interferences are located is needed. Simulation results demonstrate that
compared with previous reconstruction-based beamformers, the proposed approach
can achieve better overall performance in the case of multiple mismatches over
a very large range of input signal-to-noise ratios.</span>

                                        <span>Classical machine learning (ML) provides a potentially powerful approach to
solving challenging quantum many-body problems in physics and chemistry.
However, the advantages of ML over more traditional methods have not been
firmly established. In this work, we prove that classical ML algorithms can
efficiently predict ground state properties of gapped Hamiltonians in finite
spatial dimensions, after learning from data obtained by measuring other
Hamiltonians in the same quantum phase of matter. In contrast, under widely
accepted complexity theory assumptions, classical algorithms that do not learn
from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML
algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter.
Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct
classical description of a many-body quantum state that can be constructed in
feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the
state. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results in a
variety of scenarios, including Rydberg atom systems, 2D random Heisenberg
models, symmetry-protected topological phases, and topologically ordered
phases.</span>

                                        <span>In temporal difference (TD) learning, off-policy sampling is known to be more
practical than on-policy sampling, and by decoupling learning from data
collection, it enables data reuse. It is known that policy evaluation
(including multi-step off-policy importance sampling) has the interpretation of
solving a generalized Bellman equation. In this paper, we derive finite-sample
bounds for any general off-policy TD-like stochastic approximation algorithm
that solves for the fixed-point of this generalized Bellman operator. Our key
step is to show that the generalized Bellman operator is simultaneously a
contraction mapping with respect to a weighted $\ell_p$-norm for each $p$ in
$[1,\infty)$, with a common contraction factor.

Off-policy TD-learning is known to suffer from high variance due to the
product of importance sampling ratios. A number of algorithms (e.g.
$Q^\pi(\lambda)$, Tree-Backup$(\lambda)$, Retrace$(\lambda)$, and $Q$-trace)
have been proposed in the literature to address this issue. Our results
immediately imply finite-sample bounds of these algorithms. In particular, we
provide first-known finite-sample guarantees for $Q^\pi(\lambda)$,
Tree-Backup$(\lambda)$, and Retrace$(\lambda)$, and improve the best known
bounds of $Q$-trace in [19]. Moreover, we show the bias-variance trade-offs in
each of these algorithms.</span>

complex problems, the likes of which we could not have imagined a few decades
back. But as many benefits as it brings, there are still ways in which it can
be used to bring harm to our society. Deep fakes have been proven to be one
such problem, and now more than ever, when any individual can create a fake
image or video simply using an application on the smartphone, there need to be
some countermeasures, with which we can detect if the image or video is a fake
or real and dispose of the problem threatening the trustworthiness of online
information. Although the Deep fakes created by neural networks, may seem to be
as real as a real image or video, it still leaves behind spatial and temporal
traces or signatures after moderation, these signatures while being invisible
to a human eye can be detected with the help of a neural network trained to
specialize in Deep fake detection. In this paper, we analyze several such
states of the art neural networks (MesoNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and Xception
Net) and compare them against each other, to find an optimal solution for
various scenarios like real-time deep fake detection to be deployed in online

exists a $C^r$ surjection from a simplex onto the Pareto set/front such that
the image of each subsimplex is the Pareto set/front of a subproblem, where

output that can be modified using labels specifying desired content, albeit
working with segments of levels and platformers exclusively. We expand these
works by using CVAEs for generating whole platformer and dungeon levels, and
blending levels across these genres. We show that CVAEs can reliably control
door placement in dungeons and progression direction in platformer levels.
Thus, by using appropriate labels, our approach can generate whole dungeons and
platformer levels of interconnected rooms and segments respectively as well as
levels that blend dungeons and platformers. We demonstrate our approach using
The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Mega Man and Lode Runner.</span>

                                        <span>Normalizing flows are a powerful class of generative models demonstrating
strong performance in several speech and vision problems. In contrast to other
generative models, normalizing flows have tractable likelihoods and allow for
stable training. However, they have to be carefully designed to represent
invertible functions with efficient Jacobian determinant calculation. In
practice, these requirements lead to overparameterized and sophisticated
architectures that are inferior to alternative feed-forward models in terms of
inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we investigate whether one
can distill knowledge from flow-based models to more efficient alternatives. We
provide a positive answer to this question by proposing a simple distillation
approach and demonstrating its effectiveness on state-of-the-art conditional
flow-based models for image super-resolution and speech synthesis.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a
customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog
of size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time
latency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall
but also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches
(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but
fail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,
embedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior
data, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to
latency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme
Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input
instances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve
semantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time
complexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical
linear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.
Quantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per
query and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a
competing embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning
with varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements
for online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that
are complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the
match set.</span>

expenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual&#x27;s health
condition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based
Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can
learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from
the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to
stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and
management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model
inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular
time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the
rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We
trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than
600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two
clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior
performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are
also conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The promising
results confirm that the TMAE framework is scalable to large claims data and is
able to generate efficient patient embeddings for risk stratification and

the weight parameters perturbations, i.e., sharpness, attracts attention in
recent years (Sun et al., 2020). However, sharpness is known to remain a
critical issue, &quot;scale-sensitivity.&quot; In this paper, we propose a novel
sharpness measure, Minimum Sharpness. It is known that NNs have a specific
scale transformation that constitutes equivalent classes where functional
properties are completely identical, and at the same time, their sharpness
could change unlimitedly. We define our sharpness through a minimization
problem over the equivalent NNs being invariant to the scale transformation. We
also develop an efficient and exact technique to make the sharpness tractable,
which reduces the heavy computational costs involved with Hessian. In the
experiment, we observed that our sharpness has a valid correlation with the
generalization of NNs and runs with less computational cost than existing
sharpness measures.</span>

subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and
adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive
bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To
this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)
that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a
data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and
learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.
We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates
GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,
multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a
series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par
and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is
fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level
Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this
work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained
completely end-to-end.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the phenomenon of adversarial examples in ReLU networks with
independent gaussian parameters. For networks of constant depth and with a
large range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is
polynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors
lead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and
Schacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al
(2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise
in these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to
linear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up
to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings
computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth,
but we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of
this kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant
probability, compute a function that is close to constant.</span>

                                        <span>In modern ranking problems, different and disparate representations of the
items to be ranked are often available. It is sensible, then, to try to combine
these representations to improve ranking. Indeed, learning to rank via
combining representations is both principled and practical for learning a
ranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,
however, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead
to a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the
effect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically
similar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data
examples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to
gainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe
and explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and
apply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the
Drosophila larva connectome.</span>

an active research topic in network traffic control systems. While modern
firewalls provide the capability to decrypt packets, this is not appealing for
privacy advocates. Hence, identifying any information from encrypted traffic is
a challenging task. Nonetheless, previous work has identified machine learning
methods that may enable application and service identification. The process
involves high level feature extraction from network packet data then training a
robust machine learning classifier for traffic identification. We propose a
classification technique using an ensemble of deep learning architectures on
packet, payload, and inter-arrival time sequences. To our knowledge, this is
the first time such deep learning architectures have been applied to the Server
Name Indication (SNI) classification problem. Our ensemble model beats the
state of the art machine learning methods and our up-to-date model can be found

that application of differential privacy, specifically the DP-SGD algorithm,
has a disparate impact on different sub-groups in the population, which leads
to a significantly high drop-in model utility for sub-populations that are
under-represented (minorities), compared to well-represented ones. In this
work, we aim to compare PATE, another mechanism for training deep learning
models using differential privacy, with DP-SGD in terms of fairness. We show
that PATE does have a disparate impact too, however, it is much less severe
than DP-SGD. We draw insights from this observation on what might be promising
directions in achieving better fairness-privacy trade-offs.</span>

                                        <span>High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) surpasses its predecessors in encoding
efficiency by introducing new coding tools at the cost of an increased encoding
time-complexity. The Coding Tree Unit (CTU) is the main building block used in
HEVC. In the HEVC standard, frames are divided into CTUs with the predetermined
size of up to 64x64 pixels. Each CTU is then divided recursively into a number
of equally sized square areas, known as Coding Units (CUs). Although this
diversity of frame partitioning increases encoding efficiency, it also causes
an increase in the time complexity due to the increased number of ways to find
the optimal partitioning. To address this complexity, numerous algorithms have
been proposed to eliminate unnecessary searches during partitioning CTUs by
exploiting the correlation in the video. In this paper, existing CTU depth
decision algorithms for HEVC are surveyed. These algorithms are categorized
into two groups, namely statistics and machine learning approaches. Statistics
approaches are further subdivided into neighboring and inherent approaches.
Neighboring approaches exploit the similarity between adjacent CTUs to limit
the depth range of the current CTU, while inherent approaches use only the
available information within the current CTU. Machine learning approaches try
to extract and exploit similarities implicitly. Traditional methods like
support vector machines or random forests use manually selected features, while
recently proposed deep learning methods extract features during training.
Finally, this paper discusses extending these methods to more recent video
coding formats such as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and AOMedia Video 1(AV1).</span>

creating fictional characters. Concretely, writers progressively turn the bot
into their imagined character through conversation. We iteratively developed
CharacterChat in a user-centred approach, starting with a survey on character
creation with writers (N&#x3D;30), followed by two qualitative user studies (N&#x3D;7 and
N&#x3D;8). Our prototype combines two modes: (1) Guided prompts help writers define
character attributes (e.g. User: &quot;Your name is Jane.&quot;), including suggestions
for attributes (e.g. Bot: &quot;What is my main motivation?&quot;) and values, realised
as a rule-based system with a concept network. (2) Open conversation with the
chatbot helps writers explore their character and get inspiration, realised
with a language model that takes into account the defined character attributes.
Our user studies reveal benefits particularly for early stages of character
creation, and challenges due to limited conversational capabilities. We
conclude with lessons learned and ideas for future work.</span>

expressed content. More importantly, the scarcity of datasets annotating
diverse implicit roles limits empirical studies into their linguistic nuances.
For example, in the web review &quot;Great service!&quot;, the provider and consumer are
implicit arguments of different types. We examine an annotated corpus of
fine-grained implicit arguments (Cui and Hershcovich, 2020) by carefully
re-annotating it, resolving several inconsistencies. Subsequently, we present
the first transition-based neural parser that can handle implicit arguments
dynamically, and experiment with two different transition systems on the
improved dataset. We find that certain types of implicit arguments are more
difficult to parse than others and that the simpler system is more accurate in
recovering implicit arguments, despite having a lower overall parsing score,
attesting current reasoning limitations of NLP models. This work will
facilitate a better understanding of implicit and underspecified language, by

each entity to a unique embedding vector. Such a shallow lookup results in a
linear growth of memory consumption for storing the embedding matrix and incurs
high computational costs when working with real-world KGs. Drawing parallels
with subword tokenization commonly used in NLP, we explore the landscape of
more parameter-efficient node embedding strategies with possibly sublinear
memory requirements. To this end, we propose NodePiece, an anchor-based
approach to learn a fixed-size entity vocabulary. In NodePiece, a vocabulary of
subword/sub-entity units is constructed from anchor nodes in a graph with known
relation types. Given such a fixed-size vocabulary, it is possible to bootstrap
an encoding and embedding for any entity, including those unseen during
training. Experiments show that NodePiece performs competitively in node
classification, link prediction, and relation prediction tasks while retaining
less than 10% of explicit nodes in a graph as anchors and often having 10x
fewer parameters.</span>

(1) an automatic speech recognition system that yields text transcripts of the
spoken interactions involved, and (2) a multiple classifier system based on
deep learners that ranks the transcripts into proficiency classes. Different
deep neural network architectures (both feed-forward and recurrent) are
specialized over diverse representations of the texts in terms of: a reference
grammar, the outcome of probabilistic language models, several word embeddings,
and two bag-of-word models. Combination of the individual classifiers is
realized either via a probabilistic pseudo-joint model, or via a neural mixture

comprehension (MRC) tasks but the results are hard to explain. An appealing
approach to make models explainable is to provide rationales for its decision.
To facilitate supervised learning of human rationales, here we present PALRACE
(Pruned And Labeled RACE), a new MRC dataset with human labeled rationales for
800 passages selected from the RACE dataset. We further classified the question
to each passage into 6 types. Each passage was read by at least 26
participants, who labeled their rationales to answer the question. Besides, we
conducted a rationale evaluation session in which participants were asked to
answering the question solely based on labeled rationales, confirming that the
labeled rationales were of high quality and can sufficiently support question
answering.</span>

advancements in pre-training large models on massive amounts of data and the
need for intelligent agents to communicate in a natural manner. While
techniques can effectively generate fluent text, they can also produce
undesirable societal biases that can have a disproportionately negative impact
on marginalized populations. Language generation presents unique challenges for
biases in terms of direct user interaction and the structure of decoding
techniques. To better understand these challenges, we present a survey on
societal biases in language generation, focusing on how data and techniques
contribute to biases and progress towards reducing biases. Motivated by a lack
of studies on biases from decoding techniques, we also conduct experiments to
quantify the effects of these techniques. By further discussing general trends
and open challenges, we call to attention promising directions for research and
the importance of fairness and inclusivity considerations for language
generation applications.</span>

world is a key way for them to exhibit the human-like intelligence.
Image-grounded conversation is thus proposed to address this challenge.
Existing works focus on exploring the multimodal dialog models that ground the
conversation on a given image. In this paper, we take a step further to study
image-grounded conversation under a fully open-ended setting where no paired
dialog and image are assumed available. Specifically, we present Maria, a
neural conversation agent powered by the visual world experiences which are
retrieved from a large-scale image index. Maria consists of three flexible
components, i.e., text-to-image retriever, visual concept detector and
visual-knowledge-grounded response generator. The retriever aims to retrieve a
correlated image to the dialog from an image index, while the visual concept
detector extracts rich visual knowledge from the image. Then, the response
generator is grounded on the extracted visual knowledge and dialog context to
generate the target response. Extensive experiments demonstrate Maria
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics and human
evaluation, and can generate informative responses that have some visual
commonsense of the physical world.</span>

between the kinds of knowledge or skill levels we can achieve on different
tasks at the same time. When it comes to Neural Networks, that is not the case,
the major breakthroughs in the field are extremely task and domain specific.
Vision and language are dealt with in separate manners, using separate methods
and different datasets. In this work, we propose to use knowledge acquired by
benchmark Vision Models which are trained on ImageNet to help a much smaller
architecture learn to classify text. After transforming the textual data
contained in the IMDB dataset to gray scale images. An analysis of different
domains and the Transfer Learning method is carried out. Despite the challenge
posed by the very different datasets, promising results are achieved. The main
contribution of this work is a novel approach which links large pretrained
models on both language and vision to achieve state-of-the-art results in
different sub-fields from the original task. Without needing high compute
capacity resources. Specifically, Sentiment Analysis is achieved after
transferring knowledge between vision and language models. BERT embeddings are
transformed into grayscale images, these images are then used as training
examples for pretrained vision models such as VGG16 and ResNet

captions. By tagging images with soft text labels using a trained visual
classifier with a fixed vocabulary, previous work has shown that it is possible
to train a model that can detect whether a particular text keyword occurs in
speech utterances or not. Here we investigate whether visually grounded speech
models can also do keyword localisation: predicting where, within an utterance,
a given textual keyword occurs without any explicit text-based or alignment
supervision. We specifically consider whether incorporating attention into a
convolutional model is beneficial for localisation. Although absolute
localisation performance with visually supervised models is still modest
(compared to using unordered bag-of-word text labels for supervision), we show
that attention provides a large gain in performance over previous visually
grounded models. As in many other speech-image studies, we find that many of
the incorrect localisations are due to semantic confusions, e.g. locating the
word &#x27;backstroke&#x27; for the query keyword &#x27;swimming&#x27;.</span>

Brazilian legal proceedings in three possible classes of status: (i) archived
proceedings, (ii) active proceedings, and (iii) suspended proceedings. This
problem&#x27;s resolution is intended to assist public and private institutions in
managing large portfolios of legal proceedings, providing gains in scale and
efficiency. In this paper, legal proceedings are made up of sequences of short
texts called &quot;motions.&quot; We combined several natural language processing (NLP)
and machine learning techniques to solve the problem. Although working with
Portuguese NLP, which can be challenging due to lack of resources, our
approaches performed remarkably well in the classification task, achieving
maximum accuracy of .93 and top average F1 Scores of .89 (macro) and .93
(weighted). Furthermore, we could extract and interpret the patterns learned by
one of our models besides quantifying how those patterns relate to the
classification task. The interpretability step is important among machine
learning legal applications and gives us an exciting insight into how black-box

                                        <span>Most existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems tend to overly rely on
language bias and hence fail to reason from the visual clue. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Language-Prior Feedback (LPF) objective function, to
re-balance the proportion of each answer&#x27;s loss value in the total VQA loss.
The LPF firstly calculates a modulating factor to determine the language bias
using a question-only branch. Then, the LPF assigns a self-adaptive weight to
each training sample in the training process. With this reweighting mechanism,
the LPF ensures that the total VQA loss can be reshaped to a more balanced
form. By this means, the samples that require certain visual information to
predict will be efficiently used during training. Our method is simple to
implement, model-agnostic, and end-to-end trainable. We conduct extensive
experiments and the results show that the LPF (1) brings a significant
improvement over various VQA models, (2) achieves competitive performance on
the bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark.</span>

perspectives. Readers can quickly comprehend the main points of a long document
with the help of a structured outline. However, little research has been
conducted on this subject, partially due to the lack of large-scale faceted
summarization datasets. In this study, we present FacetSum, a faceted
summarization benchmark built on Emerald journal articles, covering a diverse
range of domains. Different from traditional document-summary pairs, FacetSum
provides multiple summaries, each targeted at specific sections of a long
document, including the purpose, method, findings, and value. Analyses and
empirical results on our dataset reveal the importance of bringing structure
into summaries. We believe FacetSum will spur further advances in summarization
research and foster the development of NLP systems that can leverage the
structured information in both long texts and summaries.</span>

output sentence by enforcing the presence or absence of certain words and
phrases. Although current approaches can enforce terms to appear in the
translation, they often struggle to make the constraint word form agree with
the rest of the generated output. Our manual analysis shows that 46% of the
errors in the output of a baseline constrained model for English to Czech
translation are related to agreement. We investigate mechanisms to allow neural
machine translation to infer the correct word inflection given lemmatized
constraints. In particular, we focus on methods based on training the model
with constraints provided as part of the input sequence. Our experiments on the
English-Czech language pair show that this approach improves the translation of
constrained terms in both automatic and manual evaluation by reducing errors in
agreement. Our approach thus eliminates inflection errors, without introducing
new errors or decreasing the overall quality of the translation.</span>

previous approaches requiring style-labeled training data, our method makes use
of readily-available unlabeled text by relying on the implicit connection in
style between adjacent sentences, and uses labeled data only at inference time.
We adapt T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), a strong pretrained text-to-text model, to
extract a style vector from text and use it to condition the decoder to perform
style transfer. As our label-free training results in a style vector space
encoding many facets of style, we recast transfers as &quot;targeted restyling&quot;
vector operations that adjust specific attributes of the input while preserving
others. We demonstrate that training on unlabeled Amazon reviews data results
in a model that is competitive on sentiment transfer, even compared to models
trained fully on labeled data. Furthermore, applying our novel method to a
diverse corpus of unlabeled web text results in a single model capable of
transferring along multiple dimensions of style (dialect, emotiveness,
formality, politeness, sentiment) despite no additional training and using only
a handful of exemplars at inference time.</span>

                                        <span>This paper addresses a series of complex and unresolved issues in the
historical phonology of West Iranian languages. The West Iranian languages
(Persian, Kurdish, Balochi, and other languages) display a high degree of
non-Lautgesetzlich behavior. Most of this irregularity is undoubtedly due to
language contact; we argue, however, that an oversimplified view of the
processes at work has prevailed in the literature on West Iranian dialectology,
with specialists assuming that deviations from an expected outcome in a given
non-Persian language are due to lexical borrowing from some chronological stage
of Persian. It is demonstrated that this qualitative approach yields at times
problematic conclusions stemming from the lack of explicit probabilistic
inferences regarding the distribution of the data: Persian may not be the sole
donor language; additionally, borrowing at the lexical level is not always the
mechanism that introduces irregularity. In many cases, the possibility that
West Iranian languages show different reflexes in different conditioning
environments remains under-explored. We employ a novel Bayesian approach
designed to overcome these problems and tease apart the different determinants
of irregularity in patterns of West Iranian sound change. Our methodology
allows us to provisionally resolve a number of outstanding questions in the
literature on West Iranian dialectology concerning the dialectal affiliation of
certain sound changes. We outline future directions for work of this sort.</span>

positivity bias, a tendency for people to report positive views of reality. But

we show that English negative reviews tend to contain more positive words than
negative words, using a variety of datasets. We reconcile this observation with
prior findings on the pragmatics of negation, and show that negations are

work within a standardized pipeline and measure cross-lingual generalization
ability in terms of out-of-sample performance. The method performs
competitively with recent supervised and unsupervised approaches for

(ASR), especially character-based models. With the combined choice of
characters from multiple languages, the outcome from character-based models
suffers from phoneme duplication, resulting in language-inconsistent spellings.
We propose Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) loss to
encourage spelling consistencies of a character-based non-autoregressive ASR
which allows for faster inference. The CCTC loss conditions the main prediction
on the predicted contexts to ensure language consistency in the spellings. In
contrast to existing CTC-based approaches, CCTC loss does not require
frame-level alignments, since the context ground truth is obtained from the
model&#x27;s estimated path. Compared to the same model trained with regular CTC
loss, our method consistently improved the ASR performance on both CS and

                                        <span>Event extraction is a fundamental task for natural language processing.
Finding the roles of event arguments like event participants is essential for
event extraction. However, doing so for real-life event descriptions is
challenging because an argument&#x27;s role often varies in different contexts.
While the relationship and interactions between multiple arguments are useful
for settling the argument roles, such information is largely ignored by
existing approaches. This paper presents a better approach for event extraction
by explicitly utilizing the relationships of event arguments. We achieve this
through a carefully designed task-oriented dialogue system. To model the
argument relation, we employ reinforcement learning and incremental learning to
extract multiple arguments via a multi-turned, iterative process. Our approach
leverages knowledge of the already extracted arguments of the same sentence to
determine the role of arguments that would be difficult to decide individually.
It then uses the newly obtained information to improve the decisions of
previously extracted arguments. This two-way feedback process allows us to
exploit the argument relations to effectively settle argument roles, leading to
better sentence understanding and event extraction. Experimental results show
that our approach consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art event
extraction methods for the classification of events and argument role and
argument identification.</span>

                                        <span>The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot
scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works
focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the
original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity
Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be
applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the
dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional
encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional
encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can
incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to
accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the
kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional
encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized
attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity.
Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional
encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized
attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be
trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model
performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than
standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.</span>

errors in OCR text. Such errors may be the result of incorrect insertion,
deletion, or substitution of a character, or the transposition of two adjacent
characters within a single word. Or, it can be the result of word boundary
problems that lead to run-on errors and incorrect-split errors. The traditional
N-gram correction methods can handle single-word errors effectively. However,
they show limitations when dealing with split and merge errors. In this paper,
we develop an unsupervised method that can handle both errors. The method we
develop leads to a sizable improvement in the correction rates. This tutorial
paper addresses very difficult word correction problems - namely incorrect
run-on and split errors - and illustrates what needs to be considered when
addressing such problems. We outline a possible approach and assess its success
on a limited study.</span>

                                        <span>Atomic clauses are fundamental text units for understanding complex
sentences. Identifying the atomic sentences within complex sentences is
important for applications such as summarization, argument mining, discourse
analysis, discourse parsing, and question answering. Previous work mainly
relies on rule-based methods dependent on parsing. We propose a new task to
decompose each complex sentence into simple sentences derived from the tensed
clauses in the source, and a novel problem formulation as a graph edit task.
Our neural model learns to Accept, Break, Copy or Drop elements of a graph that
combines word adjacency and grammatical dependencies. The full processing
pipeline includes modules for graph construction, graph editing, and sentence
generation from the output graph. We introduce DeSSE, a new dataset designed to
train and evaluate complex sentence decomposition, and MinWiki, a subset of
MinWikiSplit. ABCD achieves comparable performance as two parsing baselines on
MinWiki. On DeSSE, which has a more even balance of complex sentence types, our
model achieves higher accuracy on the number of atomic sentences than an
encoder-decoder baseline. Results include a detailed error analysis.</span>

Unlocking information trapped in these documents can enable researchers and
practitioners to operate confidently in the information world. Biomedical NER,
the task of recognising biomedical names, is usually employed as the first step
of the NLP pipeline. Standard NER models, based on sequence tagging technique,
are good at recognising short entity mentions in the generic domain. However,
there are several open challenges of applying these models to recognise
biomedical names: 1) Biomedical names may contain complex inner structure
(discontinuity and overlapping) which cannot be recognised using standard
sequence tagging technique; 2) The training of NER models usually requires
large amount of labelled data, which are difficult to obtain in the biomedical
domain; and, 3) Commonly used language representation models are pre-trained on
generic data; a domain shift therefore exists between these models and target
biomedical data. To deal with these challenges, we explore several research
directions and make the following contributions: 1) we propose a
transition-based NER model which can recognise discontinuous mentions; 2) We
develop a cost-effective approach that nominates the suitable pre-training
data; and, 3) We design several data augmentation methods for NER. Our
contributions have obvious practical implications, especially when new
biomedical applications are needed. Our proposed data augmentation methods can
help the NER model achieve decent performance, requiring only a small amount of
labelled data. Our investigation regarding selecting pre-training data can
improve the model by incorporating language representation models, which are
pre-trained using in-domain data. Finally, our proposed transition-based NER
model can further improve the performance by recognising discontinuous
mentions.</span>

other domains focus exclusively on basic emotion categories as defined by Ekman
or Plutchik. However, art (such as literature) enables engagement in a broader
range of more complex and subtle emotions. These have been shown to also
include mixed emotional responses. We consider emotions in poetry as they are
elicited in the reader, rather than what is expressed in the text or intended
by the author. Thus, we conceptualize a set of aesthetic emotions that are
predictive of aesthetic appreciation in the reader, and allow the annotation of
multiple labels per line to capture mixed emotions within their context. We
evaluate this novel setting in an annotation experiment both with carefully
trained experts and via crowdsourcing. Our annotation with experts leads to an
acceptable agreement of kappa &#x3D; .70, resulting in a consistent dataset for
future large scale analysis. Finally, we conduct first emotion classification
experiments based on BERT, showing that identifying aesthetic emotions is
challenging in our data, with up to .52 F1-micro on the German subset. Data and

However, the term explanation encompasses a broad range of notions, each with
different properties and ramifications. Our goal is to provide an overview of
diverse types of explanations and human limitations, and discuss implications
for collecting and using explanations in NLP. Inspired by prior work in
psychology and cognitive sciences, we group existing human explanations in NLP
into three categories: proximal mechanism, evidence, and procedure. These three
types differ in nature and have implications for the resultant explanations.
For instance, procedure is not considered explanations in psychology and
connects with a rich body of work on learning from instructions. The diversity
of explanations is further evidenced by proxy questions that are needed for
annotators to interpret and answer open-ended why questions. Finally,
explanations may require different, often deeper, understandings than
predictions, which casts doubt on whether humans can provide useful
explanations in some tasks.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a novel spoken-text-style conversion method that
can simultaneously execute multiple style conversion modules such as
punctuation restoration and disfluency deletion without preparing matched
datasets. In practice, transcriptions generated by automatic speech recognition
systems are not highly readable because they often include many disfluencies
and do not include punctuation marks. To improve their readability, multiple
spoken-text-style conversion modules that individually model a single
conversion task are cascaded because matched datasets that simultaneously
handle multiple conversion tasks are often unavailable. However, the cascading
is unstable against the order of tasks because of the chain of conversion
errors. Besides, the computation cost of the cascading must be higher than the
single conversion. To execute multiple conversion tasks simultaneously without
preparing matched datasets, our key idea is to distinguish individual
conversion tasks using the on-off switch. In our proposed zero-shot joint
modeling, we switch the individual tasks using multiple switching tokens,
enabling us to utilize a zero-shot learning approach to executing simultaneous
conversions. Our experiments on joint modeling of disfluency deletion and
punctuation restoration demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</span>

                                        <span>End-to-end models with auto-regressive decoders have shown impressive results
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models formulate the
sequence-level probability as a product of the conditional probabilities of all
individual tokens given their histories. However, the performance of locally
normalised models can be sub-optimal because of factors such as exposure bias.
Consequently, the model distribution differs from the underlying data
distribution. In this paper, the residual energy-based model (R-EBM) is
proposed to complement the auto-regressive ASR model to close the gap between
the two distributions. Meanwhile, R-EBMs can also be regarded as
utterance-level confidence estimators, which may benefit many downstream tasks.
Experiments on a 100hr LibriSpeech dataset show that R-EBMs can reduce the word
error rates (WERs) by 8.2%/6.7% while improving areas under precision-recall
curves of confidence scores by 12.6%/28.4% on test-clean/test-other sets.
Furthermore, on a state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning
(wav2vec 2.0), R-EBMs still significantly improves both the WER and confidence
estimation performance.</span>

high-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch,
proprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other
hand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific
assumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all
existing vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but
also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the
Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few
architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that
also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model
leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into
a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We
show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong,
specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images,
point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance
comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly
attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in
AudioSet.</span>

random latent vectors. Although manipulating the latent vectors controls the
synthesized outputs, editing real images with GANs suffers from i)
time-consuming optimization for projecting real images to the latent vectors,
ii) or inaccurate embedding through an encoder. We propose StyleMapGAN: the
intermediate latent space has spatial dimensions, and a spatially variant
modulation replaces AdaIN. It makes the embedding through an encoder more
accurate than existing optimization-based methods while maintaining the
properties of GANs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in various image manipulation
tasks such as local editing and image interpolation. Last but not least,
conventional editing methods on GANs are still valid on our StyleMapGAN. Source

                                        <span>A popular way to create detailed yet easily controllable 3D shapes is via
procedural modeling, i.e. generating geometry using programs. Such programs
consist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter
values. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program
should be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful
manipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design
higher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of
commands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring
such macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely
restricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm
for automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of
3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an
imperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that
make programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free
parameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on
multiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D
shape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of
macros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that
generalize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros
found by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape
generative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we
conduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD&#x27;s discovered macros make
interactive shape editing more efficient.</span>

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model&#x27;s architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless.</span>

patients where the annotated data is limited or unavailable. There have been
several attempts to use gradient-based attribution methods to localize
pathology from medical scans without using segmentation labels. This research
direction has been impeded by the lack of robustness and reliability. These
methods are highly sensitive to the network parameters. In this study, we
introduce a robust visual explanation method to address this problem for
medical applications. We provide an innovative visual explanation algorithm for
general purpose and as an example application, we demonstrate its effectiveness
for quantifying lesions in the lungs caused by the Covid-19 with high accuracy
and robustness without using dense segmentation labels. This approach overcomes
the drawbacks of commonly used Grad-CAM and its extended versions. The premise
behind our proposed strategy is that the information flow is minimized while
ensuring the classifier prediction stays similar. Our findings indicate that
the bottleneck condition provides a more stable severity estimation than the
similar attribution methods.</span>

                                        <span>The outbreak of COVID-19 Disease due to the novel coronavirus has caused a
shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process,
automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been
explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep
learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the
data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning
(FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to
cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data.
However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may
cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a
simple yet effective algorithm, named \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that
shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our
approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy
and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the
COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals
to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without
sharing local patients&#x27; data.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, visual Transformer (ViT) and its following works abandon the
convolution and exploit the self-attention operation, attaining a comparable or
even higher accuracy than CNNs. More recently, MLP-Mixer abandons both the
convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture
containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises
an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves
promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset. But it
cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when
training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet21K. The
performance drop of MLP-Mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We
discover that the token-mixing MLP is a variant of the depthwise convolution
with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. But the
global reception field and the spatial-specific property make token-mixing MLP
prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture,
spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP). Different from MLP-Mixer, our S$^2$-MLP only
contains channel-mixing MLP. We utilize a spatial-shift operation for
communications between patches. It has a local reception field and is
spatial-agnostic. It is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The
proposed S$^2$-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-Mixer when
training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S$^2$-MLP accomplishes as excellent
performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler
architecture and fewer FLOPs and parameters.</span>

major bottleneck in medical imaging settings. Findings on natural images
suggest that deep neural models can show a strong textural bias when carrying
out image classification tasks. In this thorough empirical study, we draw
inspiration from findings on natural images and investigate ways in which
addressing the textural bias phenomenon could bring up the robustness of deep
segmentation models when applied to three-dimensional (3D) medical data. To
achieve this, publicly available MRI scans from the Developing Human Connectome
Project are used to study ways in which simulating textural noise can help
train robust models in a complex semantic segmentation task. We contribute an
extensive empirical investigation consisting of 176 experiments and illustrate
how applying specific types of simulated textural noise prior to training can
lead to texture invariant models, resulting in improved robustness when
segmenting scans corrupted by previously unseen noise types and levels.</span>

                                        <span>Current low-precision quantization algorithms often have the hidden cost of
conversion back and forth from floating point to quantized integer values. This
hidden cost limits the latency improvement realized by quantizing Neural
Networks. To address this, we present HAWQV3, a novel mixed-precision
integer-only quantization framework. The contributions of HAWQV3 are the
following: (i) An integer-only inference where the entire computational graph
is performed only with integer multiplication, addition, and bit shifting,
without any floating point operations or even integer division; (ii) A novel
hardware-aware mixed-precision quantization method where the bit-precision is
calculated by solving an integer linear programming problem that balances the
trade-off between model perturbation and other constraints, e.g., memory
footprint and latency; (iii) Direct hardware deployment and open source
contribution for 4-bit uniform/mixed-precision quantization in TVM, achieving
an average speed up of $1.45\times$ for uniform 4-bit, as compared to uniform
8-bit for ResNet50 on T4 GPUs; and (iv) extensive evaluation of the proposed
methods on ResNet18/50 and InceptionV3, for various model compression levels
with/without mixed precision. For ResNet50, our INT8 quantization achieves an
accuracy of $77.58\%$, which is $2.68\%$ higher than prior integer-only work,
and our mixed-precision INT4/8 quantization can reduce INT8 latency by $23\%$
and still achieve $76.73\%$ accuracy. Our framework and the TVM implementation
have been open sourced.</span>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

facing downwards, we collected images of sea turtle carapace, each belonging to
one of sixteen Chelonia mydas juveniles. We then learned co-variant and robust
image descriptors from these images, enabling indexing and retrieval. In this
work, we presented several classification results of sea turtle carapaces using
the learned image descriptors. We found that a template-based descriptor, i.e.,
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) performed exceedingly better during
classification than keypoint-based descriptors. For our dataset, a
high-dimensional descriptor is a must due to the minimal gradient and color

                                        <span>Most existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems tend to overly rely on
language bias and hence fail to reason from the visual clue. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Language-Prior Feedback (LPF) objective function, to
re-balance the proportion of each answer&#x27;s loss value in the total VQA loss.
The LPF firstly calculates a modulating factor to determine the language bias
using a question-only branch. Then, the LPF assigns a self-adaptive weight to
each training sample in the training process. With this reweighting mechanism,
the LPF ensures that the total VQA loss can be reshaped to a more balanced
form. By this means, the samples that require certain visual information to
predict will be efficiently used during training. Our method is simple to
implement, model-agnostic, and end-to-end trainable. We conduct extensive
experiments and the results show that the LPF (1) brings a significant
improvement over various VQA models, (2) achieves competitive performance on
the bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work has shown that convolutional neural network classifiers overly
rely on texture at the expense of shape cues. We make a similar but different
distinction between shape and local image cues, on the one hand, and global
image statistics, on the other. Our method, called Permuted Adaptive Instance
Normalization (pAdaIN), reduces the representation of global statistics in the
hidden layers of image classifiers. pAdaIN samples a random permutation $\pi$
that rearranges the samples in a given batch. Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample
$i$ and the corresponding activations of the sample $\pi(i)$, thus swapping
statistics between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics
are distorted, this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such
as shape or texture. By choosing the random permutation with probability $p$
and the identity permutation otherwise, one can control the effect&#x27;s strength.

With the correct choice of $p$, fixed apriori for all experiments and
selected without considering test data, our method consistently outperforms
baselines in multiple settings. In image classification, our method improves on
both CIFAR100 and ImageNet using multiple architectures. In the setting of
robustness, our method improves on both ImageNet-C and Cifar-100-C for multiple
architectures. In the setting of domain adaptation and domain generalization,
our method achieves state of the art results on the transfer learning task from
GTAV to Cityscapes and on the PACS benchmark.</span>

given only a single image. The core of our method is the estimation of a
geometric scaffold for the object and its use as a guide for the reconstruction
of the underlying radiance field. Our formulation is based on a generative
process that first maps a latent code to a voxelized shape, and then renders it
to an image, with the object appearance being controlled by a second latent
code. During inference, we optimize both the latent codes and the networks to
fit a test image of a new object. The explicit disentanglement of shape and
appearance allows our model to be fine-tuned given a single image. We can then
render new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they represent
faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize to
images outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings and even real
photographs). Finally, the inferred geometric scaffold is itself an accurate
estimate of the object&#x27;s 3D shape. We demonstrate in several experiments the
effectiveness of our approach in both synthetic and real images.</span>

                                        <span>Reflecting on the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in deep
reinforcement learning (RL) have been in the discrete action domain. Robotic
manipulation, however, is inherently a continuous control environment, but
these continuous control reinforcement learning algorithms often depend on
actor-critic methods that are sample-inefficient and inherently difficult to
train, due to the joint optimisation of the actor and critic. To that end, we
explore how we can bring the stability of discrete action RL algorithms to the
robot manipulation domain. We extend the recently released ARM algorithm, by
replacing the continuous next-best pose agent with a discrete next-best pose
agent. Discretisation of rotation is trivial given its bounded nature, while
translation is inherently unbounded, making discretisation difficult. We
formulate the translation prediction as the voxel prediction problem by
discretising the 3D space; however, voxelisation of a large workspace is memory
intensive and would not work with a high density of voxels, crucial to
obtaining the resolution needed for robotic manipulation. We therefore propose
to apply this voxel prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner by gradually
increasing the resolution. In each step, we extract the highest valued voxel as
the predicted location, which is then used as the centre of the
higher-resolution voxelisation in the next step. This coarse-to-fine prediction
is applied over several steps, giving a near-lossless prediction of the
translation. We show that our new coarse-to-fine algorithm is able to
accomplish RLBench tasks much more efficiently than the continuous control
equivalent, and even train some real-world tasks, tabular rasa, in less than 7
minutes, with only 3 demonstrations. Moreover, we show that by moving to a
voxel representation, we are able to easily incorporate observations from
multiple cameras.</span>

classification models, tagged by the community with the broader term supervised
learning. The extraordinary results gave rise to a hype loaded with ambitious
promises and overstatements. Soon the community realised that the success owed
much to the availability of thousands of labelled examples and supervised
learning went, for many, from glory to shame: Some criticised deep learning as
a whole and others proclaimed that the way forward had to be alternatives to
supervised learning: predictive, unsupervised, semi-supervised and, more
recently, self-supervised learning. However, all these seem brand names, rather
than actual categories of a theoretically grounded taxonomy. Moreover, the call
to banish supervised learning was motivated by the questionable claim that
humans learn with little or no supervision and are capable of robust
out-of-distribution generalisation. Here, we review insights about learning and
supervision in nature, revisit the notion that learning and generalisation are
not possible without supervision or inductive biases and argue that we will
make better progress if we just call it by its name.</span>

aiming to achieve high-generalization capability in cross-content, -resolution
and -frame rate quality prediction. In particular, we evaluate the quality of a
video by learning effective feature representations in spatial-temporal domain.
In the spatial domain, to tackle the resolution and content variations, we
impose the Gaussian distribution constraints on the quality features. The
unified distribution can significantly reduce the domain gap between different
video samples, resulting in a more generalized quality feature representation.
Along the temporal dimension, inspired by the mechanism of visual perception,
we propose a pyramid temporal aggregation module by involving the short-term
and long-term memory to aggregate the frame-level quality. Experiments show
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on cross-dataset
settings, and achieves comparable performance on intra-dataset configurations,
demonstrating the high-generalization capability of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Automated high throughput plant phenotyping involves leveraging sensors, such
as RGB, thermal and hyperspectral cameras (among others), to make large scale
and rapid measurements of the physical properties of plants for the purpose of
better understanding the difference between crops and facilitating rapid plant
breeding programs. One of the most basic phenotyping tasks is to determine the
cultivar, or species, in a particular sensor product. This simple phenotype can
be used to detect errors in planting and to learn the most differentiating
features between cultivars. It is also a challenging visual recognition task,
as a large number of highly related crops are grown simultaneously, leading to
a classification problem with low inter-class variance. In this paper, we
introduce the Sorghum-100 dataset, a large dataset of RGB imagery of sorghum
captured by a state-of-the-art gantry system, a multi-resolution network
architecture that learns both global and fine-grained features on the crops,
and a new global pooling strategy called Dynamic Outlier Pooling which
outperforms standard global pooling strategies on this task.</span>

                                        <span>The subtleties of human perception, as measured by vision scientists through
the use of psychophysics, are important clues to the internal workings of
visual recognition. For instance, measured reaction time can indicate whether a
visual stimulus is easy for a subject to recognize, or whether it is hard. In
this paper, we consider how to incorporate psychophysical measurements of
visual perception into the loss function of a deep neural network being trained
for a recognition task, under the assumption that such information can enforce
consistency with human behavior. As a case study to assess the viability of
this approach, we look at the problem of handwritten document transcription.
While good progress has been made towards automatically transcribing modern
handwriting, significant challenges remain in transcribing historical
documents. Here we describe a general enhancement strategy, underpinned by the
new loss formulation, which can be applied to the training regime of any deep
learning-based document transcription system. Through experimentation, reliable
performance improvement is demonstrated for the standard IAM and RIMES datasets
for three different network architectures. Further, we go on to show
feasibility for our approach on a new dataset of digitized Latin manuscripts,
originally produced by scribes in the Cloister of St. Gall in the the 9th
century.</span>

                                        <span>Image classification is an important task in various machine learning
applications. In recent years, a number of classification methods based on
quantum machine learning and different quantum image encoding techniques have
been proposed. In this paper, we study the effect of three different quantum
image encoding approaches on the performance of a convolution-inspired hybrid
quantum-classical image classification algorithm called quanvolutional neural
network (QNN). We furthermore examine the effect of variational - i.e.
trainable - quantum circuits on the classification results. Our experiments
indicate that some image encodings are better suited for variational circuits.
However, our experiments show as well that there is not one best image
encoding, but that the choice of the encoding depends on the specific

the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible
transformations. Yet, modeling long-range dependencies over normalizing flows
remains understudied. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce two types of
invertible attention mechanisms for generative flow models. To be precise, we
propose map-based and scaled dot-product attention for unconditional and
conditional generative flow models. The key idea is to exploit split-based
attention mechanisms to learn the attention weights and input representations
on every two splits of flow feature maps. Our method provides invertible
attention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling seamless
integration of it at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed
attention mechanism can model the global data dependencies, leading to more
comprehensive flow models. Evaluation on multiple generation tasks demonstrates
that the introduced attention flow idea results in efficient flow models and
compares favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional
generative flow methods.</span>

                                        <span>Designed to learn long-range interactions on sequential data, transformers
continue to show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks. In
contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local
interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible
for long sequences, such as high-resolution images. We demonstrate how
combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity
of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution
images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of image
constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their
composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to
conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object
classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the
generated image. In particular, we present the first results on
semantically-guided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers and obtain
the state of the art among autoregressive models on class-conditional ImageNet.

examples. Black-box attack is the most threatening attack. At present,
black-box attack methods mainly adopt gradient-based iterative attack methods,
which usually limit the relationship between the iteration step size, the
number of iterations, and the maximum perturbation. In this paper, we propose a
new gradient iteration framework, which redefines the relationship between the
above three. Under this framework, we easily improve the attack success rate of
DI-TI-MIM. In addition, we propose a gradient iterative attack method based on
input dropout, which can be well combined with our framework. We further
propose a multi dropout rate version of this method. Experimental results show
that our best method can achieve attack success rate of 96.2\% for defense
model on average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based
attacks.</span>

temporal spans has not been fully explored. This is partially because that,
existing benchmark datasets were mainly collected with limited spatial and
temporal ranges, e.g., using videos recorded in a few days by cameras in a
specific region of the campus. Such limited spatial and temporal ranges make it
hard to simulate the difficulties of person re-ID in real scenarios. In this
work, we contribute a novel Large-scale Spatio-Temporal LaST person re-ID
dataset, including 10,862 identities with more than 228k images. Compared with
existing datasets, LaST presents more challenging and high-diversity re-ID
settings, and significantly larger spatial and temporal ranges. For instance,
each person can appear in different cities or countries, and in various time
slots from daytime to night, and in different seasons from spring to winter. To
our best knowledge, LaST is a novel person re-ID dataset with the largest
spatio-temporal ranges. Based on LaST, we verified its challenge by conducting
a comprehensive performance evaluation of 14 re-ID algorithms. We further
propose an easy-to-implement baseline that works well on such challenging re-ID
setting. We also verified that models pre-trained on LaST can generalize well
on existing datasets with short-term and cloth-changing scenarios. We expect
LaST to inspire future works toward more realistic and challenging re-ID tasks.

via powerful learned prior from the numerous external natural images. However,
they show unpleasant results on the test image whose distribution is far from
the that of training images because their models are biased toward the training
images. In this paper, we propose a simple image inpainting algorithm with
test-time adaptation named AdaFill. Given a single out-of-distributed test
image, our goal is to complete hole region more naturally than the pre-trained
inpainting models. To achieve this goal, we treat remained valid regions of the
test image as another training cues because natural images have strong internal
similarities. From this test-time adaptation, our network can exploit
externally learned image priors from the pre-trained features as well as the
internal prior of the test image explicitly. Experimental results show that
AdaFill outperforms other models on the various out-of-distribution test
images. Furthermore, the model named ZeroFill, that are not pre-trained also
sometimes outperforms the pre-trained models.</span>

                                        <span>Optical colonoscopy (OC), the most prevalent colon cancer screening tool, has
a high miss rate due to a number of factors, including the geometry of the
colon (haustral fold and sharp bends occlusions), endoscopist inexperience or
fatigue, endoscope field of view, etc. We present a framework to visualize the
missed regions per-frame during the colonoscopy, and provides a workable
clinical solution. Specifically, we make use of 3D reconstructed virtual
colonoscopy (VC) data and the insight that VC and OC share the same underlying
geometry but differ in color, texture and specular reflections, embedded in the
OC domain. A lossy unpaired image-to-image translation model is introduced with
enforced shared latent space for OC and VC. This shared latent space captures
the geometric information while deferring the color, texture, and specular
information creation to additional Gaussian noise input. This additional noise
input can be utilized to generate one-to-many mappings from VC to OC and OC to
OC. The code, data and trained models will be released via our Computational
Endoscopy Platform at https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) often trains and evaluates a large number of
architectures. Recent predictor-based NAS approaches attempt to address such
heavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some
architecture-performance pairs and fitting a proxy accuracy predictor. Given
limited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top
architectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This
paper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find
the best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We
propose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one
strong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the
high-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key
property of the proposed weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling
better architectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed
architectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new
better weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework produces
coarse-to-fine iteration to refine the ranking of sampling space gradually.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method costs fewer samples to find
top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, as well as
achieves the state-of-the-art ImageNet performance on the NASNet search space.
In particular, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor-based NAS methods,
WeakNAS outperforms all of them with notable margins, e.g., requiring at least
7.5x less samples to find global optimal on NAS-Bench-101; and WeakNAS can also
absorb them for further performance boost. We further strike the new SOTA
result of 81.3% in the ImageNet MobileNet Search Space. The code is available
at https://github.com/VITA-Group/WeakNAS.</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models have recently demonstrated the ability to synthesize
photorealistic images of human faces with novel identities. A key challenge to
the wide applicability of such techniques is to provide independent control
over semantically meaningful parameters: appearance, head pose, face shape, and
facial expressions. In this paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our
knowledge the first method that learns a variational latent feature space of
neural face textures, which allows sampling of novel identities. We combine
this generative model with a parametric face model and gain explicit control
over head pose and facial expressions. To generate images of complete human
heads, we propose an additive decoder that generates plausible additional
details such as hair. A novel training scheme enforces a pose independent
latent space and in consequence, allows learning of a one-to-many mapping
between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions. The resulting
method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel identities
allowing fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial
expressions, facilitating a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling
novel identities, re-posing, expression transfer, and more.</span>

consuming vertical videos on hand-held devices. To revitalize the exposure of
horizontal contents, we hereby set forth the exploration of automated
horizontal-to-vertical (abbreviated as H2V) video conversion with our proposed
H2V framework, accompanied by an accurately annotated H2V-142K dataset.
Concretely, H2V framework integrates video shot boundary detection, subject
selection and multi-object tracking to facilitate the subject-preserving
conversion, wherein the key is subject selection. To achieve so, we propose a
Rank-SS module that detects human objects, then selects the subject-to-preserve
via exploiting location, appearance, and salient cues. Afterward, the framework
automatically crops the video around the subject to produce vertical contents
from horizontal sources. To build and evaluate our H2V framework, H2V-142K
dataset is densely annotated with subject bounding boxes for 125 videos with
132K frames and 9,500 video covers, upon which we demonstrate superior subject
selection performance comparing to traditional salient approaches, and exhibit
promising horizontal-to-vertical conversion performance overall. By publicizing
this dataset as well as our approach, we wish to pave the way for more valuable
endeavors on the horizontal-to-vertical video conversion task.</span>

                                        <span>Fluorescence microscopy allows for a detailed inspection of cells, cellular
networks, and anatomical landmarks by staining with a variety of
carefully-selected markers visualized as color channels. Quantitative
characterization of structures in acquired images often relies on automatic
image analysis methods. Despite the success of deep learning methods in other
vision applications, their potential for fluorescence image analysis remains
underexploited. One reason lies in the considerable workload required to train
accurate models, which are normally specific for a given combination of
markers, and therefore applicable to a very restricted number of experimental
settings. We herein propose Marker Sampling and Excite, a neural network
approach with a modality sampling strategy and a novel attention module that
together enable (i) flexible training with heterogeneous datasets with
combinations of markers and (ii) successful utility of learned models on
arbitrary subsets of markers prospectively. We show that our single neural
network solution performs comparably to an upper bound scenario where an
ensemble of many networks is na\&quot;ively trained for each possible marker
combination separately. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this
framework in high-throughput biological analysis by revising a recent
quantitative characterization of bone marrow vasculature in 3D confocal
microscopy datasets and further confirm the validity of our approach on an
additional, significantly different dataset of microvessels in fetal liver
tissues. Not only can our work substantially ameliorate the use of deep
learning in fluorescence microscopy analysis, but it can also be utilized in
other fields with incomplete data acquisitions and missing modalities.</span>

                                        <span>Cross-domain object detection is challenging, because object detection model
is often vulnerable to data variance, especially to the considerable domain
shift between two distinctive domains. In this paper, we propose a new Unbiased
Mean Teacher (UMT) model for cross-domain object detection. We reveal that
there often exists a considerable model bias for the simple mean teacher (MT)
model in cross-domain scenarios, and eliminate the model bias with several
simple yet highly effective strategies. In particular, for the teacher model,
we propose a cross-domain distillation method for MT to maximally exploit the
expertise of the teacher model. Moreover, for the student model, we alleviate
its bias by augmenting training samples with pixel-level adaptation. Finally,
for the teaching process, we employ an out-of-distribution estimation strategy
to select samples that most fit the current model to further enhance the
cross-domain distillation process. By tackling the model bias issue with these
strategies, our UMT model achieves mAPs of 44.1%, 58.1%, 41.7%, and 43.1% on
benchmark datasets Clipart1k, Watercolor2k, Foggy Cityscapes, and Cityscapes,
respectively, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art results in

was developed and presented in this paper. It was easy-to-use and automatic
system designed to help rice farmers improve the rice yield and quality. The
targeted images were taken from the actual paddy environment without special
sample preparation. We used a deep learning neural networks technique to detect
rice diseases from the images. We developed an object detection model training
and refinement process to improve the performance of our previous research on
rice leave diseases detection. The process was based on analyzing the model&#x27;s
predictive results and could be repeatedly used to improve the quality of the
database in the next training of the model. The deployment model for our LINE
Bot system was created from the selected best performance technique in our
previous paper, YOLOv3, trained by refined training data set. The performance
of the deployment model was measured on 5 target classes and found that the
Average True Positive Point improved from 91.1% in the previous paper to 95.6%
in this study. Therefore, we used this deployment model for Rice Disease LINE
Bot system. Our system worked automatically real-time to suggest primary
diagnosis results to the users in the LINE group, which included rice farmers
and rice disease specialists. They could communicate freely via chat. In the
real LINE Bot deployment, the model&#x27;s performance was measured by our own
defined measurement Average True Positive Point and was found to be an average
of 78.86%. The system was fast and took only 2-3 s for detection process in our
system server.</span>

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained considerable attention
owing to their ability to reproduce images. However, they can recreate training
images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and
compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the
recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by
demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy
images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators.
However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to
decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its
application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur,
compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these
problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that
can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without
knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or
quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator
model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators.
However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we
introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a
data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to
suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression,
we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between
irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative
studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ. In addition, we
demonstrate the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration.</span>

development of reliable autonomous vehicles in dense urban environments. The
interactions between vehicle and pedestrian or bicyclist have a significant
impact on the trajectories of traffic participants e.g. stopping or turning to
avoid collisions. Although recent datasets and trajectory prediction approaches
have fostered the development of autonomous vehicles yet the amount of
vehicle-pedestrian (bicyclist) interactions modeled are sparse. In this work,
we propose Euro-PVI, a dataset of pedestrian and bicyclist trajectories. In
particular, our dataset caters more diverse and complex interactions in dense
urban scenarios compared to the existing datasets. To address the challenges in
predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we develop a joint
inference model that learns an expressive multi-modal shared latent space
across agents in the urban scene. This enables our Joint-$\beta$-cVAE approach
to better model the distribution of future trajectories. We achieve state of
the art results on the nuScenes and Euro-PVI datasets demonstrating the
importance of capturing interactions between ego-vehicle and pedestrians
(bicyclists) for accurate predictions.</span>

can allow for better estimation of missed surface and can also serve as
valuable landmarks for registering pre-treatment virtual (CT) and optical
colonoscopies, to guide navigation towards the anomalies found in pre-treatment

introduced in order to leverage ground truth information between haustral fold

since its first report in December 2019 and thoracic computed tomography (CT)
has become one of the main tools for its diagnosis. In recent years, deep
learning-based approaches have shown impressive performance in myriad image
recognition tasks. However, they usually require a large number of annotated
data for training. Inspired by Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), a common finding in
COIVD-19 patient&#x27;s CT scans, we proposed in this paper a novel self-supervised
pretraining method based on pseudo lesions generation and restoration for
COVID-19 diagnosis. We used Perlin noise, a gradient noise based mathematical
model, to generate lesion-like patterns, which were then randomly pasted to the
lung regions of normal CT images to generate pseudo COVID-19 images. The pairs
of normal and pseudo COVID-19 images were then used to train an encoder-decoder
architecture based U-Net for image restoration, which does not require any
labelled data. The pretrained encoder was then fine-tuned using labelled data
for COVID-19 diagnosis task. Two public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of
CT images were employed for evaluation. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed self-supervised learning approach could extract
better feature representation for COVID-19 diagnosis and the accuracy of the
proposed method outperformed the supervised model pretrained on large scale
images by 6.57% and 3.03% on SARS-CoV-2 dataset and Jinan COVID-19 dataset,

foveation operations have for machine vision systems, inspired by the foveated
human visual system, which has higher acuity at the center of gaze and
texture-like encoding in the periphery. To do so, we introduce models
consisting of a first-stage \textit{fixed} image transform followed by a
second-stage \textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the
first stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage,
which we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with
spatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and
a final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1)
the foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the
reference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d.
generalization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater
sensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to
occlusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a
stronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with
a weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over
different classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics.
Altogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based
computations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format
of scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the
representational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have
for processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the
next generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.

                                        <span>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is among the worlds leading vision loss causes in
diabetic patients. DR is a microvascular disease that affects the eye retina,
which causes vessel blockage and therefore cuts the main source of nutrition
for the retina tissues. Treatment for this visual disorder is most effective
when it is detected in its earliest stages, as severe DR can result in
irreversible blindness. Nonetheless, DR identification requires the expertise
of Ophthalmologists which is often expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,
automatic detection systems were introduced aiming to facilitate the
identification process, making it available globally in a time and
cost-efficient manner. However, due to the limited reliable datasets and
medical records for this particular eye disease, the obtained predictions
accuracies were relatively unsatisfying for eye specialists to rely on them as
diagnostic systems. Thus, we explored an ensemble-based learning strategy,
merging a substantial selection of well-known classification algorithms in one
sophisticated diagnostic model. The proposed framework achieved the highest
accuracy rates among all other common classification algorithms in the area. 4
subdatasets were generated to contain the top 5 and top 10 features of the
Messidor dataset, selected by InfoGainEval. and WrapperSubsetEval., accuracies

processing as a promising substitute of convolution-based neural networks for
visual learning tasks. However, its supremacy degenerates given an insufficient
amount of training data (e.g., ImageNet). To make it into practical utility, we
propose a novel distillation-based method to train vision transformers. Unlike
previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, we
introduce lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases
(e.g., convolution and involution) to co-advise the student transformer. The
key is that teachers with different inductive biases attain different knowledge
despite that they are trained on the same dataset, and such different knowledge
compounds and boosts the student&#x27;s performance during distillation. Equipped
with this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers
(termed as CivT) outperform all previous transformers of the same architecture
on ImageNet.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate detection of obstacles in 3D is an essential task for autonomous
driving and intelligent transportation. In this work, we propose a general
multimodal fusion framework FusionPainting to fuse the 2D RGB image and 3D
point clouds at a semantic level for boosting the 3D object detection task.
Especially, the FusionPainting framework consists of three main modules: a
multi-modal semantic segmentation module, an adaptive attention-based semantic
fusion module, and a 3D object detector. First, semantic information is
obtained for 2D images and 3D Lidar point clouds based on 2D and 3D
segmentation approaches. Then the segmentation results from different sensors
are adaptively fused based on the proposed attention-based semantic fusion
module. Finally, the point clouds painted with the fused semantic label are
sent to the 3D detector for obtaining the 3D objection results. The
effectiveness of the proposed framework has been verified on the large-scale
nuScenes detection benchmark by comparing it with three different baselines.
The experimental results show that the fusion strategy can significantly
improve the detection performance compared to the methods using only point
clouds, and the methods using point clouds only painted with 2D segmentation
information. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes testing benchmark.</span>

synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on
absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as,
e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces
of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that
causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the
network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural
changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the
hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of
StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they
are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our

                                        <span>Building instance segmentation models that are data-efficient and can handle
rare object categories is an important challenge in computer vision. Leveraging
data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge.
Here, we perform a systematic study of the Copy-Paste augmentation ([13, 12])
for instance segmentation where we randomly paste objects onto an image. Prior
studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for
pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting
objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong
baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised
methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (e.g. self-training).
On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an
improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art.
We further demonstrate that Copy-Paste can lead to significant improvements on
the LVIS benchmark. Our baseline model outperforms the LVIS 2020 Challenge
winning entry by +3.6 mask AP on rare categories.</span>

retrieval. Reducing the search space into a finite set of action segments
facilitates a faster and less noisy matching. However, there exist a
substantial gap in machine understanding of natural temporal cuts during a

segmenting action segments in videos captured using an egocentric camera. Gaze
is used to locate the region-of-interest inside a frame. By tracking two simple

finite set of temporal cuts. We present several results using combinations (of

In this paper, we compare the performance of several widely used saliency
map-based interpretabilty techniques (Gradient, SmoothGrad and GradCAM), when
applied to Binarized or Full Precision Neural Networks (FPNNs). We found that
the basic Gradient method produces very similar-looking maps for both types of
network. However, SmoothGrad produces significantly noisier maps for BNNs.
GradCAM also produces saliency maps which differ between network types, with
some of the BNNs having seemingly nonsensical explanations. We comment on
possible reasons for these differences in explanations and present it as an
example of why interpretability techniques should be tested on a wider range of
network types.</span>

AI algorithms for potential bias based on demographic characteristics such as
race and gender, and the development of algorithms to address this bias. Most
applications to date have been in computer vision, although some work in
healthcare has started to emerge. The use of deep learning (DL) in cardiac MR
segmentation has led to impressive results in recent years, and such techniques
are starting to be translated into clinical practice. However, no work has yet
investigated the fairness of such models. In this work, we perform such an

imbalance, using a nnU-Net model trained and evaluated on cine short axis
cardiac MR data from the UK Biobank dataset, consisting of 5,903 subjects from
6 different racial groups. We find statistically significant differences in
Dice performance between different racial groups. To reduce the racial bias, we
investigated three strategies: (1) stratified batch sampling, in which batch
sampling is stratified to ensure balance between racial groups; (2) fair
meta-learning for segmentation, in which a DL classifier is trained to classify
race and jointly optimized with the segmentation model; and (3) protected group
models, in which a different segmentation model is trained for each racial
group. We also compared the results to the scenario where we have a perfectly
balanced database. To assess fairness we used the standard deviation (SD) and
skewed error ratio (SER) of the average Dice values. Our results demonstrate
that the racial bias results from the use of imbalanced training data, and that
all proposed bias mitigation strategies improved fairness, with the best SD and
SER resulting from the use of protected group models.</span>

an unexpected level. In the face of increasing data, the importance of data
processing has increased remarkably. Our resource topic is on the processing of
video data, which has an important place in increasing data, and the production
of summary videos. Within the scope of this resource, a new method for anomaly
detection with object-based unsupervised learning has been developed while
creating a video summary. By using this method, the video data is processed as
pixels and the result is produced as a video segment. The process flow can be
briefly summarized as follows. Objects on the video are detected according to
their type, and then they are tracked. Then, the tracking history data of the
objects are processed, and the classifier is trained with the object type.
Thanks to this classifier, anomaly behavior of objects is detected. Video
segments are determined by processing video moments containing anomaly
behaviors. The video summary is created by extracting the detected video
segments from the original video and combining them. The model we developed has
been tested and verified separately for single camera and dual camera systems.</span>

has mostly been driven by the search for the best performance in terms of
classification accuracy on standardized benchmarks like ImageNet. More
recently, this focus has been expanded by the notion of model robustness, i.e.
the generalization abilities of models towards previously unseen changes in the
data distribution. While new benchmarks, like ImageNet-C, have been introduced
to measure robustness properties, we argue that fixed testsets are only able to
capture a small portion of possible data variations and are thus limited and
prone to generate new overfitted solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, we
suggest to estimate the robustness of a model directly from the structure of
its learned feature-space. We introduce robustness indicators which are
obtained via unsupervised clustering of latent representations inside a trained
classifier and show very high correlations to the model performance on
corrupted test data.</span>

                                        <span>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the most prevalent cause of vision
impairment and irreversible blindness in the working-age adults. Due to the
renaissance of deep learning (DL), DL-based DR diagnosis has become a promising
tool for the early screening and severity grading of DR. However, training deep
neural networks (DNNs) requires an enormous amount of carefully labeled data.
Noisy label data may be introduced when labeling plenty of data, degrading the
performance of models. In this work, we propose a novel label management
mechanism (LMM) for the DNN to overcome overfitting on the noisy data. LMM
utilizes maximum posteriori probability (MAP) in the Bayesian statistic and
time-weighted technique to selectively correct the labels of unclean data,
which gradually purify the training data and improve classification
performance. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic noise data (Messidor
\&amp; our collected DR dataset) and real-world noise data (ANIMAL-10N)
demonstrated that LMM could boost performance of models and is superior to
three state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we present Vision Permutator, a conceptually simple and data
efficient MLP-like architecture for visual recognition. By realizing the
importance of the positional information carried by 2D feature representations,
unlike recent MLP-like models that encode the spatial information along the
flattened spatial dimensions, Vision Permutator separately encodes the feature
representations along the height and width dimensions with linear projections.
This allows Vision Permutator to capture long-range dependencies along one
spatial direction and meanwhile preserve precise positional information along
the other direction. The resulting position-sensitive outputs are then
aggregated in a mutually complementing manner to form expressive
representations of the objects of interest. We show that our Vision Permutators
are formidable competitors to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers. Without the dependence on spatial convolutions or attention
mechanisms, Vision Permutator achieves 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without
extra large-scale training data (e.g., ImageNet-22k) using only 25M learnable
parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision transformers under
the same model size constraint. When scaling up to 88M, it attains 83.2% top-1
accuracy. We hope this work could encourage research on rethinking the way of
encoding spatial information and facilitate the development of MLP-like models.

participate in the challenge, we employ a transformer to capture the spatial
information from each modality. Secondly, we employ a temporal attention module
to model temporal-wise inter-dependency. Thirdly, we employ the adversarial
domain adaptation network to learn the general features between labeled source
and unlabeled target domain. Finally, we incorporate multiple modalities to
improve the performance by a three-stream network with late fusion. Our network
achieves the comparable performance with the state-of-the-art baseline T$A^3$N
and outperforms the baseline on top-1 accuracy for verb class and top-5
accuracies for all three tasks which are verb, noun and action. Under the team

                                        <span>One widely used approach towards understanding the inner workings of deep
convolutional neural networks is to visualize unit responses via activation
maximization. Feature visualizations via activation maximization are thought to
provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a
unit to be activated. If this is indeed true, these synthetic images should
enable humans to predict the effect of an intervention, such as whether
occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog&#x27;s head) changes a unit&#x27;s
activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to predict which of
two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit&#x27;s activation. Both a
large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on
average, the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017)
indeed help humans on this task ($67 \pm 4\%$ accuracy; baseline performance
without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3\%$). However, they do not provide any
significant advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples),
which yield similar performance ($66 \pm 3\%$ to $67 \pm 3\%$ accuracy). Taken
together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit
of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that
feature visualizations provide humans with better &quot;causal understanding&quot; than
simple alternative visualizations.</span>

                                        <span>Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown great
potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep
learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while
the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative
tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label
selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for
generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this
work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with
continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image
synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an
uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images
with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is
achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our
framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis
problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from
different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify
our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show
that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved
the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training
UDA methods.</span>

                                        <span>Recent studies have shown remarkable success in the unsupervised image to
image (I2I) translation. However, due to the imbalance in the data, learning
joint distribution for various domains is still very challenging. Although
existing models can generate realistic target images, it&#x27;s difficult to
maintain the structure of the source image. In addition, training a generative
model on large data in multiple domains requires a lot of time and computer
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a novel image-to-image
translation method that generates images of the target domain by finetuning a
stylegan2 pretrained model. The stylegan2 model is suitable for unsupervised
I2I translation on unbalanced datasets; it is highly stable, produces realistic
images, and even learns properly from limited data when applied with simple
fine-tuning techniques. Thus, in this paper, we propose new methods to preserve
the structure of the source images and generate realistic images in the target
domain. The code and results are available at

characterizing patient blood samples. Automated methods to detect and classify
blood cell subtypes have important medical applications. Automated medical
image processing and analysis offers a powerful tool for medical diagnosis. In
this work we tackle the problem of white blood cell classification based on the
morphological characteristics of their outer contour, color. The work we would
explore a set of preprocessing and segmentation (Color-based segmentation,
Morphological processing, contouring) algorithms along with a set of features
extraction methods (Corner detection algorithms and Histogram of
Gradients(HOG)), dimensionality reduction algorithms (Principal Component
Analysis(PCA)) that are able to recognize and classify through various
Unsupervised(k-nearest neighbors) and Supervised (Support Vector Machine,
Decision Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis,
Naive Bayes) algorithms different categories of white blood cells to
Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. We even take a step forwards
to explore various Deep Convolutional Neural network architecture (Sqeezent,
MobilenetV1,MobilenetV2, InceptionNet etc.) without preprocessing/segmentation
and with preprocessing. We would like to explore many algorithms to identify
the robust algorithm with least time complexity and low resource requirement.
The outcome of this work can be a cue to selection of algorithms as per
requirement for automated blood cell classification.</span>

                                        <span>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) results from chronic remodeling caused by
a broad range of systemic and cardiovascular disease including hypertension,
aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis. Early
detection and characterization of LVH can significantly impact patient care but
is limited by under-recognition of hypertrophy, measurement error and
variability, and difficulty differentiating etiologies of LVH. To overcome this
challenge, we present EchoNet-LVH - a deep learning workflow that automatically
quantifies ventricular hypertrophy with precision equal to human experts and
predicts etiology of LVH. Trained on 28,201 echocardiogram videos, our model
accurately measures intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE]
1.4mm, 95% CI 1.2-1.5mm), left ventricular diameter (MAE 2.4mm, 95% CI
2.2-2.6mm), and posterior wall thickness (MAE 1.2mm, 95% CI 1.1-1.3mm) and
classifies cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve of 0.83) and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (AUC 0.98) from other etiologies of LVH. In external datasets
from independent domestic and international healthcare systems, EchoNet-LVH
accurately quantified ventricular parameters (R2 of 0.96 and 0.90 respectively)
and detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC 0.79) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(AUC 0.89) on the domestic external validation site. Leveraging measurements
across multiple heart beats, our model can more accurately identify subtle
changes in LV geometry and its causal etiologies. Compared to human experts,
EchoNet-LVH is fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise
measurements, and lays the foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac
hypertrophy. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly
available a large dataset of 23,212 annotated echocardiogram videos.</span>

plays a significant role in several application scenarios including autonomous
driving, land cover classification, and urban planning, etc. However, the
tremendous details contained in the VFR image severely limit the potential of
the existing deep learning approaches. More seriously, the considerable
variations in scale and appearance of objects further deteriorate the
representational capacity of those se-mantic segmentation methods, leading to
the confusion of adjacent objects. Addressing such is-sues represents a
promising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way
for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this
manuscript, we pro-pose a bilateral awareness network (BANet) which contains a
dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range
relationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specif-ically, the
dependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone
with memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is
built on the stacked convo-lution operation. Besides, using the linear
attention mechanism, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to
effectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive
experiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation
datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid
dataset, demonstrate the effective-ness of our BANet. Specifically, a 64.6%
mIoU is achieved on the UAVid dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Low-rankness is important in the hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising tasks.
The tensor nuclear norm (TNN), defined based on the tensor singular value
decomposition, is a state-of-the-art method to describe the low-rankness of
HSI. However, TNN ignores some of the physical meanings of HSI in tackling the
denoising tasks, leading to suboptimal denoising performance. In this paper, we
propose the multi-modal and frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm (MFWTNN) and
the non-convex MFWTNN for HSI denoising tasks. Firstly, we investigate the
physical meaning of frequency components and reconsider their weights to
improve the low-rank representation ability of TNN. Meanwhile, we also consider
the correlation among two spatial dimensions and the spectral dimension of HSI
and combine the above improvements to TNN to propose MFWTNN. Secondly, we use
non-convex functions to approximate the rank function of the frequency tensor
and propose the NonMFWTNN to relax the MFWTNN better. Besides, we adaptively
choose bigger weights for slices mainly containing noise information and
smaller weights for slices containing profile information. Finally, we develop
the efficient alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) based algorithm
to solve the proposed models, and the effectiveness of our models are
substantiated in simulated and real HSI datasets.</span>

long-term AR applications. Multi-agent cooperative SLAM is the precondition of
multi-user AR interaction. The cooperation of multiple smart phones has the
potential to improve efficiency and robustness of task completion and can
complete tasks that a single agent cannot do. However, it depends on robust
communication, efficient location detection, robust mapping, and efficient
information sharing among agents. We propose a multi-intelligence collaborative
monocular visual-inertial SLAM deployed on multiple ios mobile devices with a
centralized architecture. Each agent can independently explore the environment,
run a visual-inertial odometry module online, and then send all the measurement
information to a central server with higher computing resources. The server
manages all the information received, detects overlapping areas, merges and
optimizes the map, and shares information with the agents when needed. We have
verified the performance of the system in public datasets and real
environments. The accuracy of mapping and fusion of the proposed system is

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is
usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at
the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy
issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for
segmentation, and propose to adapt an &#x60;&#x60;off-the-shelf&quot; segmentation model
pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive
batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the
domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are
gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the
consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and
shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The
transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to
balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free
UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,
self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our
framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our
source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for
the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the
cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods
with the source data.</span>

                                        <span>3D face reconstruction from a single image is a task that has garnered
increased interest in the Computer Vision community, especially due to its
broad use in a number of applications such as realistic 3D avatar creation,
pose invariant face recognition and face hallucination. Since the introduction
of the 3D Morphable Model in the late 90&#x27;s, we witnessed an explosion of
research aiming at particularly tackling this task. Nevertheless, despite the
increasing level of detail in the 3D face reconstructions from single images
mainly attributed to deep learning advances, finer and highly deformable
components of the face such as the tongue are still absent from all 3D face
models in the literature, although being very important for the realness of the
3D avatar representations. In this work we present the first, to the best of
our knowledge, end-to-end trainable pipeline that accurately reconstructs the
3D face together with the tongue. Moreover, we make this pipeline robust in
&quot;in-the-wild&quot; images by introducing a novel GAN method tailored for 3D tongue
surface generation. Finally, we make publicly available to the community the
first diverse tongue dataset, consisting of 1,800 raw scans of 700 individuals
varying in gender, age, and ethnicity backgrounds. As we demonstrate in an
extensive series of quantitative as well as qualitative experiments, our model
proves to be robust and realistically captures the 3D tongue structure, even in
adverse &quot;in-the-wild&quot; conditions.</span>

magnitudes less frequently than common ones, leading to highly-imbalanced data
where rare classes can have only handfuls of examples. Learning from few
examples is a known challenge for deep learning based classification
algorithms, and is the focus of the field of low-shot learning. One potential
approach to increase the training data for these rare classes is to augment the
limited real data with synthetic samples. This has been shown to help, but the
domain shift between real and synthetic hinders the approaches&#x27; efficacy when
tested on real data.

We explore the use of image-to-image translation methods to close the domain
gap between synthetic and real imagery for animal species classification in
data collected from camera traps: motion-activated static cameras used to
monitor wildlife. We use low-level feature alignment between source and target
domains to make synthetic data for a rare species generated using a graphics
engine more &quot;realistic&quot;. Compared against a system augmented with unaligned
synthetic data, our experiments show a considerable decrease in classification
error rates on a rare species.</span>

                                        <span>Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has attracted increasing attention recently
with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotions
are ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label
distribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classification
task. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships
between emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in
psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded
circular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual
emotion distribution learning. To be specific, we first construct an Emotion
Circle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emotion Circle,
each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is
defined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion
intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides,
we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the
dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a
coarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an
emotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on
public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Fetal motion is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional MR scan
times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and
dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with
compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal
MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices
for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording
the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes
it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods.
To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal
Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised
super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice
acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition
along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate
pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution
network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time
series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data.
Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method
outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image
quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.</span>

years, it&#x27;s still a challenge to design high accuracy algorithms with real-time
performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time instance segmentation
framework termed OrienMask. Upon the one-stage object detector YOLOv3, a mask
head is added to predict some discriminative orientation maps, which are
explicitly defined as spatial offset vectors for both foreground and background
pixels. Thanks to the discrimination ability of orientation maps, masks can be
recovered without the need for extra foreground segmentation. All instances
that match with the same anchor size share a common orientation map. This
special sharing strategy reduces the amortized memory utilization for mask
predictions but without loss of mask granularity. Given the surviving box
predictions after NMS, instance masks can be concurrently constructed from the
corresponding orientation maps with low complexity. Owing to the concise design
for mask representation and its effective integration with the anchor-based
object detector, our method is qualified under real-time conditions while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Experiments on COCO benchmark show that
OrienMask achieves 34.8 mask AP at the speed of 42.7 fps evaluated with a
single RTX 2080 Ti. The code is available at https://github.com/duwt/OrienMask.</span>

machine learning paradigm. As a result of statistical heterogeneity, recent
studies clearly show that the performance of popular FL methods (e.g., FedAvg)
deteriorates dramatically due to the client drift caused by local updates. This
paper proposes a novel Federated Learning algorithm (called IGFL), which
leverages both Individual and Group behaviors to mimic distribution, thereby
improving the ability to deal with heterogeneity. Unlike existing FL methods,
our IGFL can be applied to both client and server optimization. As a
by-product, we propose a new attention-based federated learning in the server
optimization of IGFL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to
incorporate attention mechanisms into federated optimization. We conduct
extensive experiments and show that IGFL can significantly improve the
performance of existing federated learning methods. Especially when the
distributions of data among individuals are diverse, IGFL can improve the
classification accuracy by about 13% compared with prior baselines.</span>

robust representations of histopathological images for the pRCC subtyping task
by extracting finer features from instance patches (by cropping around
segmented nuclei and assigning predicted grades). The proposed i-ViT takes
top-K instances as input and aggregates them for capturing both the cellular
and cell-layer level patterns by a position-embedding layer, a grade-embedding
layer, and a multi-head multi-layer self-attention module. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework, experienced pathologists are invited to
selected 1162 regions of interest from 171 whole slide images of type 1 and
type 2 pRCC. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better
performance than existing CNN-based models with a significant margin.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce Transductive Infomation Maximization (TIM) for few-shot
learning. Our method maximizes the mutual information between the query
features and their label predictions for a given few-shot task, in conjunction
with a supervision loss based on the support set. We motivate our transductive
loss by deriving a formal relation between the classification accuracy and
mutual-information maximization. Furthermore, we propose a new
alternating-direction solver, which substantially speeds up transductive
inference over gradient-based optimization, while yielding competitive
accuracy. We also provide a convergence analysis of our solver based on
Zangwill&#x27;s theory and bound-optimization arguments. TIM inference is modular:
it can be used on top of any base-training feature extractor. Following
standard transductive few-shot settings, our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that TIM outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly across
various datasets and networks, while used on top of a fixed feature extractor
trained with simple cross-entropy on the base classes, without resorting to
complex meta-learning schemes. It consistently brings between 2 % and 5 %
improvement in accuracy over the best performing method, not only on all the
well-established few-shot benchmarks but also on more challenging scenarios,
with random tasks, domain shift and larger numbers of classes, as in the
recently introduced META-DATASET. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/mboudiaf/TIM. We also publicly release a standalone PyTorch
implementation of META-DATASET, along with additional benchmarking results, at

                                        <span>Image denoising is of great importance for medical imaging system, since it
can improve image quality for disease diagnosis and downstream image analyses.
In a variety of applications, dynamic imaging techniques are utilized to
capture the time-varying features of the subject, where multiple images are
acquired for the same subject at different time points. Although
signal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short
acquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited
to improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With
the success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning
methods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on
large datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several
self-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising
results without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field
of multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting
correlated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised
deep learning methods. In this work, we propose Deformed2Self, an end-to-end
self-supervised deep learning framework for dynamic imaging denoising. It
combines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and
use a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices.
Further, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary
observations at different time frames for training and inference. Evaluations
on phantom and in vivo data with different noise statistics show that our
method has comparable performance to other state-of-the-art unsupervised or
self-supervised denoising methods and outperforms under high noise levels.</span>

                                        <span>Over the years, accelerating neural networks with quantization has been
widely studied. Unfortunately, prior efforts with diverse precisions (e.g.,
1-bit weights and 2-bit activations) are usually restricted by limited
precision support on GPUs (e.g., int1 and int4). To break such restrictions, we
introduce the first Arbitrary Precision Neural Network framework (APNN-TC) to
fully exploit quantization benefits on Ampere GPU Tensor Cores. Specifically,
APNN-TC first incorporates a novel emulation algorithm to support arbitrary
short bit-width computation with int1 compute primitives and XOR/AND Boolean
operations. Second, APNN-TC integrates arbitrary precision layer designs to
efficiently map our emulation algorithm to Tensor Cores with novel batching
strategies and specialized memory organization. Third, APNN-TC embodies a novel
arbitrary precision NN design to minimize memory access across layers and
further improve performance. Extensive evaluations show that APNN-TC can
achieve significant speedup over CUTLASS kernels and various NN models, such as
ResNet and VGG.</span>

adults which has been on a constant rise. Elderly people have several needs and
requirements due to physical disabilities, cognitive issues, weakened memory
and disorganized behavior, that they face with increasing age. The extent of
these limitations also differs according to the varying diversities in elderly,
which include age, gender, background, experience, skills, knowledge and so on.
These varying needs and challenges with increasing age, limits abilities of
older adults to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in an independent
manner. To add to it, the shortage of caregivers creates a looming need for
technology-based services for elderly people, to assist them in performing
their daily routine tasks to sustain their independent living and active aging.
To address these needs, this work consists of making three major contributions
in this field. First, it provides a rather comprehensive review of assisted
living technologies aimed at helping elderly people to perform ADLs. Second,
the work discusses the challenges identified through this review, that
currently exist in the context of implementation of assisted living services
for elderly care in Smart Homes and Smart Cities. Finally, the work also
outlines an approach for implementation, extension and integration of the
existing works in this field for development of a much-needed framework that
can provide personalized assistance and user-centered behavior interventions to
elderly as per their varying and ever-changing needs.</span>

recognized in crowd counting. Humans glance at a crowd image and instantly know
the approximate number of human and where they are through attention the crowd
regions and the congestion degree of crowd regions with a global receptive
filed. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel feedback network with
Region-Aware block called RANet by modeling human&#x27;s Top-Down visual perception

maps that provide prior about candidate crowd regions in input images. The
prior enables the RANet pay more attention to crowd regions. Then we design
Region-Aware block that could adaptively encode the contextual information into
input images through global receptive field. More specifically, we scan the
whole input images and its priority maps in the form of column vector to obtain
a relevance matrix estimating their similarity. The relevance matrix obtained
would be utilized to build global relationships between pixels. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art crowd counting methods on several public datasets.</span>

innovation, the diversity of the industrial goods is significantly larger, in
which the incomplete multiview, multimodal and multilabel are different from
the traditional dataset. In this paper, we introduce an industrial goods
dataset, namely PatentNet, with numerous highly diverse, accurate and detailed

the images and texts are sourced from design patent. Within over 6M images and
corresponding texts of industrial goods labeled manually checked by
professionals, PatentNet is the first ongoing industrial goods image database
whose varieties are wider than industrial goods datasets used previously for

advancement to relieve this bottleneck. We identify one such domain, where deep
learning can be leveraged to alleviate the process of manual scoring. Novelty
preference paradigms have been widely used to study recognition memory in pigs,
but analysis of these videos requires human intervention. We introduce a subset

                                        <span>It is desirable to transfer the knowledge stored in a well-trained source
model onto non-annotated target domain in the absence of source data. However,
state-of-the-art methods for source free domain adaptation (SFDA) are subject
to strict limits: 1) access to internal specifications of source models is a
must; and 2) pseudo labels should be clean during self-training, making
critical tasks relying on semantic segmentation unreliable. Aiming at these
pitfalls, this study develops a domain adaptive solution to semantic
segmentation with pseudo label rectification (namely \textit{PR-SFDA}), which
operates in two phases: 1) \textit{Confidence-regularized unsupervised
learning}: Maximum squares loss applies to regularize the target model to
ensure the confidence in prediction; and 2) \textit{Noise-aware pseudo label
learning}: Negative learning enables tolerance to noisy pseudo labels in
training, meanwhile positive learning achieves fast convergence. Extensive
experiments have been performed on domain adaptive semantic segmentation
benchmark, \textit{GTA5 $\to$ Cityscapes}. Overall, \textit{PR-SFDA} achieves a
performance of 49.0 mIoU, which is very close to that of the state-of-the-art
counterparts. Note that the latter demand accesses to the source model&#x27;s
internal specifications, whereas the \textit{PR-SFDA} solution needs none as a
sharp contrast.</span>

                                        <span>Deep convolutional neural networks have been widely employed as an effective
technique to handle complex and practical problems. However, one of the
fundamental problems is the lack of formal methods to analyze their behavior.
To address this challenge, we propose an approach to compute the exact
reachable sets of a network given an input domain, where the reachable set is
represented by the face lattice structure. Besides the computation of reachable
sets, our approach is also capable of backtracking to the input domain given an
output reachable set. Therefore, a full analysis of a network&#x27;s behavior can be
realized. In addition, an approach for fast analysis is also introduced, which
conducts fast computation of reachable sets by considering selected sensitive
neurons in each layer. The exact pixel-level reachability analysis method is
evaluated on a CNN for the CIFAR10 dataset and compared to related works. The
fast analysis method is evaluated over a CNN CIFAR10 dataset and VGG16
architecture for the ImageNet dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Neural volume rendering became increasingly popular recently due to its
success in synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of input
images. So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was
modeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was
extracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a
noisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve
geometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We
achieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This
is in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the
volume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as
Laplace&#x27;s cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance
function (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three
benefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in
the neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity
approximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.
Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and
radiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape
and appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to
challenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry
reconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shape
and appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of the
two.</span>

is not an exception. Having automatic item descriptions is of great interest
for fashion web platforms hosting sometimes hundreds of thousands of images.
This paper is one of the first tackling image captioning for fashion images. To
contribute addressing dataset diversity issues, we introduced the InFashAIv1
dataset containing almost 16.000 African fashion item images with their titles,
prices and general descriptions. We also used the well known DeepFashion
dataset in addition to InFashAIv1. Captions are generated using the
\textit{Show and Tell} model made of CNN encoder and RNN Decoder. We showed
that jointly training the model on both datasets improves captions quality for
African style fashion images, suggesting a transfer learning from Western style
data. The InFashAIv1 dataset is released on
\href{https://github.com/hgilles06/infashai}{Github} to encourage works with
more diversity inclusion.</span>

                                        <span>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the primary tools to show
microstructural characterization of materials as well as film thickness.
However, manual determination of film thickness from TEM images is
time-consuming as well as subjective, especially when the films in question are
very thin and the need for measurement precision is very high. Such is the case
for head overcoat (HOC) thickness measurements in the magnetic hard disk drive
industry. It is therefore necessary to develop software to automatically
measure HOC thickness. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a HOC
layer segmentation method using NASNet-Large as an encoder and then followed by
a decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in
deep learning for image segmentation. To further improve segmentation results,
we are the first to propose a post-processing layer to remove irrelevant
portions in the segmentation result. To measure the thickness of the segmented
HOC layer, we propose a regressive convolutional neural network (RCNN) model as
well as orthogonal thickness calculation methods. Experimental results
demonstrate a higher dice score for our model which has lower mean squared
error and outperforms current state-of-the-art manual measurement.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are behind many of the recent successes in machine
learning applications. However, these models can produce overconfident
decisions while encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples or making a
wrong prediction. This inconsistent predictive confidence limits the
integration of independently-trained learning models into a larger system. This
paper introduces separable concept learning framework to realistically measure
the performance of classifiers in presence of OOD examples. In this setup,
several instances of a classifier are trained on different parts of a partition
of the set of classes. Later, the performance of the combination of these
models is evaluated on a separate test set. Unlike current OOD detection
techniques, this framework does not require auxiliary OOD datasets and does not
separate classification from detection performance. Furthermore, we present a
new strong baseline for more consistent predictive confidence in deep models,
called fitted ensembles, where overconfident predictions are rectified by
transformed versions of the original classification task. Fitted ensembles can
naturally detect OOD examples without requiring auxiliary data by observing
contradicting predictions among its components. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet show fitted ensemble significantly outperform
conventional ensembles on OOD examples and are possible to scale.</span>

                                        <span>Many learning-based 3D shape semantic segmentation methods assign labels to
shape atoms (e.g. points in a point cloud or faces in a mesh) with a
single-pass approach trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such methods achieve
impressive performance but require large amounts of labeled training data. This
paradigm entangles two separable subproblems: (1) decomposing a shape into
regions and (2) assigning semantic labels to these regions. We claim that
disentangling these subproblems reduces the labeled data burden: (1) region
decomposition requires no semantic labels and could be performed in an
unsupervised fashion, and (2) labeling shape regions instead of atoms results
in a smaller search space and should be learnable with less labeled training
data. In this paper, we investigate this second claim by presenting the
Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a method that learns how to assign
semantic labels to regions of an over-segmented 3D shape. We solve this problem
via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a labeling assignment
conditioned on an input shape. We employ a Monte Carlo importance sampling
approach guided by a neural proposal network, a search-based approach made
feasible by assuming the input shape is decomposed into discrete regions. We
evaluate NGSP on the task of hierarchical semantic segmentation on manufactured
3D shapes from PartNet. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance
improvements over baselines that learn to label shape atoms and then aggregate
predictions for each shape region, especially in low-data regimes. Finally, we
demonstrate that NGSP is robust to region granularity, as it maintains strong
segmentation performance even as the regions undergo significant corruption.</span>

RNNs or fusion modules to combine information from multiple images after
encoding them. These two separate steps have loose connections and do not
consider all available information while encoding each view. We propose
LegoFormer, a transformer-based model that unifies object reconstruction under
a single framework and parametrizes the reconstructed occupancy grid by its
decomposition factors. This reformulation allows the prediction of an object as
a set of independent structures then aggregated to obtain the final
reconstruction. Experiments conducted on ShapeNet display the competitive
performance of our network with respect to the state-of-the-art methods. We
also demonstrate how the use of self-attention leads to increased

                                        <span>In this work, we propose a novel straightforward method for medical volume
and sequence segmentation with limited annotations. To avert laborious
annotating, the recent success of self-supervised learning(SSL) motivates the
pre-training on unlabeled data. Despite its success, it is still challenging to
adapt typical SSL methods to volume/sequence segmentation, due to their lack of
mining on local semantic discrimination and rare exploitation on volume and
sequence structures. Based on the continuity between slices/frames and the
common spatial layout of organs across volumes/sequences, we introduced a novel
bootstrap self-supervised representation learning method by leveraging the
predictable possibility of neighboring slices. At the core of our method is a
simple and straightforward dense self-supervision on the predictions of local
representations and a strategy of predicting locals based on global context,
which enables stable and reliable supervision for both global and local
representation mining among volumes. Specifically, we first proposed an
asymmetric network with an attention-guided predictor to enforce
distance-specific prediction and supervision on slices within and across
volumes/sequences. Secondly, we introduced a novel prototype-based
foreground-background calibration module to enhance representation consistency.
The two parts are trained jointly on labeled and unlabeled data. When evaluated
on three benchmark datasets of medical volumes and sequences, our model
outperforms existing methods with a large margin of 4.5\% DSC on ACDC, 1.7\% on
Prostate, and 2.3\% on CAMUS. Intensive evaluations reveals the effectiveness
and superiority of our method.</span>

                                        <span>Detailed analysis of seizure semiology, the symptoms and signs which occur
during a seizure, is critical for management of epilepsy patients. Inter-rater
reliability using qualitative visual analysis is often poor for semiological
features. Therefore, automatic and quantitative analysis of video-recorded
seizures is needed for objective assessment.

We present GESTURES, a novel architecture combining convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn deep
representations of arbitrarily long videos of epileptic seizures.

We use a spatiotemporal CNN (STCNN) pre-trained on large human action
recognition (HAR) datasets to extract features from short snippets (approx. 0.5
s) sampled from seizure videos. We then train an RNN to learn seizure-level
representations from the sequence of features.

We curated a dataset of seizure videos from 68 patients and evaluated
GESTURES on its ability to classify seizures into focal onset seizures (FOSs)
(N &#x3D; 106) vs. focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) (N &#x3D; 77),
obtaining an accuracy of 98.9% using bidirectional long short-term memory
(BLSTM) units.

We demonstrate that an STCNN trained on a HAR dataset can be used in
combination with an RNN to accurately represent arbitrarily long videos of
seizures. GESTURES can provide accurate seizure classification by modeling
sequences of semiologies.</span>

                                        <span>This paper jointly resolves two problems in vision transformer: i) the
computation of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) has high computational/space
complexity; ii) recent vision transformer networks are overly tuned for image
classification, ignoring the difference between image classification (simple
scenarios, more similar to NLP) and downstream scene understanding tasks
(complicated scenarios, rich structural and contextual information). To this
end, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective in
various vision tasks owing to its powerful context abstraction, and its natural
property of spatial invariance is suitable to address the loss of structural
information (problem ii)). Hence, we propose to adapt pyramid pooling to MHSA
for alleviating its high requirement on computational resources (problem i)).
In this way, this pooling-based MHSA can well address the above two problems
and is thus flexible and powerful for downstream scene understanding tasks.
Plugged with our pooling-based MHSA, we build a downstream-task-oriented
transformer network, dubbed Pyramid Pooling Transformer (P2T). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that, when applied P2T as the backbone network, it
shows substantial superiority in various downstream scene understanding tasks
such as semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and
visual saliency detection, compared to previous CNN- and transformer-based
networks. The code will be released at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/P2T. Note
that this technical report will keep updating.</span>

attain the balance between exploration and exploitation. Due to the superior
performance and low feedback learning without the learning to act in multiple
situations, Multi-armed Bandits drawing widespread attention in applications
ranging such as recommender systems. Likewise, within the recommender system,
collaborative filtering (CF) is arguably the earliest and most influential
method in the recommender system. Crucially, new users and an ever-changing
pool of recommended items are the challenges that recommender systems need to
address. For collaborative filtering, the classical method is training the
model offline, then perform the online testing, but this approach can no longer
handle the dynamic changes in user preferences which is the so-called cold
start. So how to effectively recommend items to users in the absence of
effective information? To address the aforementioned problems, a multi-armed
bandit based collaborative filtering recommender system has been proposed,
named BanditMF. BanditMF is designed to address two challenges in the
multi-armed bandits algorithm and collaborative filtering: (1) how to solve the
cold start problem for collaborative filtering under the condition of scarcity
of valid information, (2) how to solve the sub-optimal problem of bandit
algorithms in strong social relations domains caused by independently

                                        <span>One of the key challenges in Sequential Recommendation (SR) is how to extract
and represent user preferences. Traditional SR methods rely on the next item as
the supervision signal to guide preference extraction and representation. We
propose a novel learning strategy, named preference editing. The idea is to
force the SR model to discriminate the common and unique preferences in
different sequences of interactions between users and the recommender system.
By doing so, the SR model is able to learn how to identify common and unique
user preferences, and thereby do better user preference extraction and
representation. We propose a transformer based SR model, named MrTransformer
(Multi-preference Transformer), that concatenates some special tokens in front
of the sequence to represent multiple user preferences and makes sure they
capture different aspects through a preference coverage mechanism. Then, we
devise a preference editing-based self-supervised learning mechanism for
training MrTransformer which contains two main operations: preference
separation and preference recombination. The former separates the common and
unique user preferences for a given pair of sequences. The latter swaps the
common preferences to obtain recombined user preferences for each sequence.
Based on the preference separation and preference recombination operations, we
define two types of SSL loss that require that the recombined preferences are
similar to the original ones, and the common preferences are close to each
other.

We carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. MrTransformer
with preference editing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods
in terms of Recall, MRR and NDCG. We find that long sequences whose user
preferences are harder to extract and represent benefit most from preference
editing.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes new acoustic feature signatures based on the multiscale
fractal dimension (MFD), which are robust against the diversity of
environmental sounds, for the content-based similarity search. The diversity of
sound sources and acoustic compositions is a typical feature of environmental
sounds. Several acoustic features have been proposed for environmental sounds.
Among them is the widely-used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs),
which describes frequency-domain features. However, in addition to these
features in the frequency domain, environmental sounds have other important
features in the time domain with various time scales. In our previous paper, we
proposed enhanced multiscale fractal dimension signature (EMFD) for
environmental sounds. This paper extends EMFD by using the kernel density
estimation method, which results in better performance of the similarity search
tasks. Furthermore, it newly proposes another acoustic feature signature based
on MFD, namely very-long-range multiscale fractal dimension signature (MFD-VL).
The MFD-VL signature describes several features of the time-varying envelope
for long periods of time. The MFD-VL signature has stability and robustness
against background noise and small fluctuations in the parameters of sound
sources, which are produced in field recordings. We discuss the effectiveness
of these signatures in the similarity sound search by comparing with acoustic
features proposed in the DCASE 2018 challenges. Due to the unique
descriptiveness of our proposed signatures, we confirmed the signatures are
effective when they are used with other acoustic features.</span>

event logs. Activities extracted from healthcare information systems with the
free-text nature may lead to inconsistent labels. Such inconsistency would then
lead to redundancy of activity labels, which refer to labels that have
different syntax but share the same behaviours. The identifications of these
labels from data-driven process discovery are difficult and rely heavily on
resource-intensive human review. Existing work achieves low accuracy either
redundant activity labels are in low occurrence frequency or the existence of
numerical data values as attributes in event logs. However, these phenomena are
commonly observed in healthcare information systems. In this paper, we propose
an approach to detect redundant activity labels using control-flow relations
and numerical data values from event logs. Natural Language Processing is also
integrated into our method to assess semantic similarity between labels, which
provides users with additional insights. We have evaluated our approach through
synthetic logs generated from the real-life Sepsis log and a case study using
the MIMIC-III data set. The results demonstrate that our approach can
successfully detect redundant activity labels. This approach can add value to
the preprocessing step to generate more representative event logs for process
mining tasks in the healthcare domain.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning models for the ad-hoc retrieval of documents and passages
have recently shown impressive improvements due to better language
understanding using large pre-trained language models. However, these
over-parameterized models are inherently non-interpretable and do not provide
any information on the parts of the documents that were used to arrive at a
certain prediction.

In this paper we introduce the select and rank paradigm for document ranking,
where interpretability is explicitly ensured when scoring longer documents.
Specifically, we first select sentences in a document based on the input query
and then predict the query-document score based only on the selected sentences,
acting as an explanation. We treat sentence selection as a latent variable
trained jointly with the ranker from the final output. We conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate that our inherently interpretable select-and-rank
approach is competitive in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and
sometimes even outperforms them. This is due to our novel end-to-end training
approach based on weighted reservoir sampling that manages to train the
selector despite the stochastic sentence selection. We also show that our
sentence selection approach can be used to provide explanations for models that
operate on only parts of the document, such as BERT.</span>

                                        <span>Atomic clauses are fundamental text units for understanding complex
sentences. Identifying the atomic sentences within complex sentences is
important for applications such as summarization, argument mining, discourse
analysis, discourse parsing, and question answering. Previous work mainly
relies on rule-based methods dependent on parsing. We propose a new task to
decompose each complex sentence into simple sentences derived from the tensed
clauses in the source, and a novel problem formulation as a graph edit task.
Our neural model learns to Accept, Break, Copy or Drop elements of a graph that
combines word adjacency and grammatical dependencies. The full processing
pipeline includes modules for graph construction, graph editing, and sentence
generation from the output graph. We introduce DeSSE, a new dataset designed to
train and evaluate complex sentence decomposition, and MinWiki, a subset of
MinWikiSplit. ABCD achieves comparable performance as two parsing baselines on
MinWiki. On DeSSE, which has a more even balance of complex sentence types, our
model achieves higher accuracy on the number of atomic sentences than an
encoder-decoder baseline. Results include a detailed error analysis.</span>

                                        <span>One widely used approach towards understanding the inner workings of deep
convolutional neural networks is to visualize unit responses via activation
maximization. Feature visualizations via activation maximization are thought to
provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a
unit to be activated. If this is indeed true, these synthetic images should
enable humans to predict the effect of an intervention, such as whether
occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog&#x27;s head) changes a unit&#x27;s
activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to predict which of
two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit&#x27;s activation. Both a
large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on
average, the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017)
indeed help humans on this task ($67 \pm 4\%$ accuracy; baseline performance
without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3\%$). However, they do not provide any
significant advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples),
which yield similar performance ($66 \pm 3\%$ to $67 \pm 3\%$ accuracy). Taken
together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit
of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that
feature visualizations provide humans with better &quot;causal understanding&quot; than
simple alternative visualizations.</span>

                                        <span>Many learning-based 3D shape semantic segmentation methods assign labels to
shape atoms (e.g. points in a point cloud or faces in a mesh) with a
single-pass approach trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such methods achieve
impressive performance but require large amounts of labeled training data. This
paradigm entangles two separable subproblems: (1) decomposing a shape into
regions and (2) assigning semantic labels to these regions. We claim that
disentangling these subproblems reduces the labeled data burden: (1) region
decomposition requires no semantic labels and could be performed in an
unsupervised fashion, and (2) labeling shape regions instead of atoms results
in a smaller search space and should be learnable with less labeled training
data. In this paper, we investigate this second claim by presenting the
Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a method that learns how to assign
semantic labels to regions of an over-segmented 3D shape. We solve this problem
via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a labeling assignment
conditioned on an input shape. We employ a Monte Carlo importance sampling
approach guided by a neural proposal network, a search-based approach made
feasible by assuming the input shape is decomposed into discrete regions. We
evaluate NGSP on the task of hierarchical semantic segmentation on manufactured
3D shapes from PartNet. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance
improvements over baselines that learn to label shape atoms and then aggregate
predictions for each shape region, especially in low-data regimes. Finally, we
demonstrate that NGSP is robust to region granularity, as it maintains strong
segmentation performance even as the regions undergo significant corruption.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) often trains and evaluates a large number of
architectures. Recent predictor-based NAS approaches attempt to address such
heavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some
architecture-performance pairs and fitting a proxy accuracy predictor. Given
limited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top
architectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This
paper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find
the best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We
propose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one
strong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the
high-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key
property of the proposed weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling
better architectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed
architectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new
better weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework produces
coarse-to-fine iteration to refine the ranking of sampling space gradually.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method costs fewer samples to find
top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, as well as
achieves the state-of-the-art ImageNet performance on the NASNet search space.
In particular, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor-based NAS methods,
WeakNAS outperforms all of them with notable margins, e.g., requiring at least
7.5x less samples to find global optimal on NAS-Bench-101; and WeakNAS can also
absorb them for further performance boost. We further strike the new SOTA
result of 81.3% in the ImageNet MobileNet Search Space. The code is available
at https://github.com/VITA-Group/WeakNAS.</span>

propose to use the assumption of a random-effect model. In this model, the mean

identically distributed random variables with which the original time series
has a causal representation. The innovation at a time is statistically
independent of the prior history of the time series. As such, it represents the
new information contained at present but not in the past. Because of its simple
probability structure, an innovations sequence is the most efficient signature
of the original. Unlike the principle or independent analysis (PCA/ICA)
representations, an innovations sequence preserves not only the complete
statistical properties but also the temporal order of the original time series.
An long-standing open problem is to find a computationally tractable way to
extract an innovations sequence of non-Gaussian processes. This paper presents
a deep learning approach, referred to as Innovations Autoencoder (IAE), that
extracts innovations sequences using a causal convolutional neural network. An
application of IAE to nonparametric anomaly detection with unknown anomaly and

                                        <span>In Federated edge learning (FEEL), energy-constrained devices at the network
edge consume significant energy when training and uploading their local machine
learning models, leading to a decrease in their lifetime. This work proposes
novel solutions for energy-efficient FEEL by jointly considering local training
data, available computation, and communications resources, and deadline
constraints of FEEL rounds to reduce energy consumption. This paper considers a
system model where the edge server is equipped with multiple antennas employing
beamforming techniques to communicate with the local users through orthogonal
channels. Specifically, we consider a problem that aims to find the optimal
user&#x27;s resources, including the fine-grained selection of relevant training
samples, bandwidth, transmission power, beamforming weights, and processing
speed with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption given a deadline
constraint on the communication rounds of FEEL. Then, we devise tractable
solutions by first proposing a novel fine-grained training algorithm that
excludes less relevant training samples and effectively chooses only the
samples that improve the model&#x27;s performance. After that, we derive closed-form
solutions, followed by a Golden-Section-based iterative algorithm to find the
optimal computation and communication resources that minimize energy
consumption. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our
proposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art solutions as
energy consumption decreases by 79% for MNIST and 73% for CIFAR-10 datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers recently are adapted from the community of natural language
processing as a promising substitute of convolution-based neural networks for
visual learning tasks. However, its supremacy degenerates given an insufficient
amount of training data (e.g., ImageNet). To make it into practical utility, we
propose a novel distillation-based method to train vision transformers. Unlike
previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, we
introduce lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases
(e.g., convolution and involution) to co-advise the student transformer. The
key is that teachers with different inductive biases attain different knowledge
despite that they are trained on the same dataset, and such different knowledge
compounds and boosts the student&#x27;s performance during distillation. Equipped
with this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers
(termed as CivT) outperform all previous transformers of the same architecture
on ImageNet.</span>

clustering, was recently used for outlier detection. In the application of
Innovation Search for outlier detection, the directions of innovation were
utilized to measure the innovation of the data points. We study the Innovation
Values computed by the Innovation Search algorithm under a quadratic cost
function and it is proved that Innovation Values with the new cost function are
equivalent to Leverage Scores. This interesting connection is utilized to
establish several theoretical guarantees for a Leverage Score based robust PCA
method and to design a new robust PCA method. The theoretical results include
performance guarantees with different models for the distribution of outliers

the algorithms against the presence of noise. The numerical and theoretical

                                        <span>Commonsense reasoning is one of the key problems in natural language
processing, but the relative scarcity of labeled data holds back the progress
for languages other than English. Pretrained cross-lingual models are a source
of powerful language-agnostic representations, yet their inherent reasoning
capabilities are still actively studied. In this work, we design a simple
approach to commonsense reasoning which trains a linear classifier with weights
of multi-head attention as features. To evaluate this approach, we create a
multilingual Winograd Schema corpus by processing several datasets from prior
work within a standardized pipeline and measure cross-lingual generalization
ability in terms of out-of-sample performance. The method performs
competitively with recent supervised and unsupervised approaches for
commonsense reasoning, even when applied to other languages in a zero-shot
manner. Also, we demonstrate that most of the performance is given by the same
small subset of attention heads for all studied languages, which provides
evidence of universal reasoning capabilities in multilingual encoders.</span>

                                        <span>This paper considers quantized distributed optimization algorithms in the
parameter server framework of distributed training. We introduce the principle
we call Differential Quantization (DQ) that prescribes that the past
quantization errors should be compensated in such a way as to direct the
descent trajectory of a quantized algorithm towards that of its unquantized
counterpart. Assuming that the objective function is smooth and strongly
convex, we prove that in the limit of large problem dimension, Differentially
Quantized Gradient Descent (DQ-GD) attains a linear contraction factor of
$\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$, where $\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ is the
contraction factor of unquantized gradient descent (GD). Thus at any
$R\geq\log_2 1 /\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ bits, the contraction factor of DQ-GD is
the same as that of unquantized GD, i.e., there is no loss due to quantization.
We show a converse demonstrating that no quantized gradient descent algorithm
can converge faster than $\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$. In contrast,
naively quantized GD where the worker directly quantizes the gradient barely
attains $\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}} + 2^{-R}$. The principle of differential
quantization continues to apply to gradient methods with momentum such as
Nesterov&#x27;s accelerated gradient descent, and Polyak&#x27;s heavy ball method. For
these algorithms as well, if the rate is above a certain threshold, there is no
loss in contraction factor obtained by the differentially quantized algorithm
compared to its unquantized counterpart, and furthermore, the differentially
quantized heavy ball method attains the optimal contraction achievable among
all (even unquantized) gradient methods. Experimental results on both simulated
and real-world least-squares problems validate our theoretical analysis.</span>

                                        <span>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), more specifically their Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) variants, have been widely used as a deep learning tool for
tackling sequence-based learning tasks in text and speech. Training of such
LSTM applications is computationally intensive due to the recurrent nature of
hidden state computation that repeats for each time step. While sparsity in
Deep Neural Nets has been widely seen as an opportunity for reducing
computation time in both training and inference phases, the usage of non-ReLU
activation in LSTM RNNs renders the opportunities for such dynamic sparsity
associated with neuron activation and gradient values to be limited or
non-existent. In this work, we identify dropout induced sparsity for LSTMs as a
suitable mode of computation reduction. Dropout is a widely used regularization
mechanism, which randomly drops computed neuron values during each iteration of
training. We propose to structure dropout patterns, by dropping out the same
set of physical neurons within a batch, resulting in column (row) level hidden
state sparsity, which are well amenable to computation reduction at run-time in
general-purpose SIMD hardware as well as systolic arrays. We conduct our
experiments for three representative NLP tasks: language modelling on the PTB
dataset, OpenNMT based machine translation using the IWSLT De-En and En-Vi
datasets, and named entity recognition sequence labelling using the CoNLL-2003
shared task. We demonstrate that our proposed approach can be used to translate
dropout-based computation reduction into reduced training time, with
improvement ranging from 1.23x to 1.64x, without sacrificing the target metric.</span>

playing, sequential prediction), human or expert data is available containing
useful information about the task. However, imitation learning (IL) from a
small amount of expert data can be challenging in high-dimensional environments
with complex dynamics. Behavioral cloning is a simple method that is widely
used due to its simplicity of implementation and stable convergence but doesn&#x27;t
utilize any information involving the environment&#x27;s dynamics. Many existing
methods that exploit dynamics information are difficult to train in practice
due to an adversarial optimization process over reward and policy approximators
or biased, high variance gradient estimators. We introduce a method for
dynamics-aware IL which avoids adversarial training by learning a single
Q-function, implicitly representing both reward and policy. On standard
benchmarks, the implicitly learned rewards show a high positive correlation
with the ground-truth rewards, illustrating our method can also be used for
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Our method, Inverse soft-Q learning
(IQ-Learn) obtains state-of-the-art results in offline and online imitation
learning settings, surpassing existing methods both in the number of required
environment interactions and scalability in high-dimensional spaces.</span>

conferences commonly constitute the main platforms for releasing the latest
peer-reviewed advancements in their respective fields. However, choosing a
suitable academic venue for publishing one&#x27;s research can represent a
challenging task considering the plethora of available conferences,
particularly for those at the start of their academic careers, or for those
seeking to publish outside of their usual domain. In this paper, we propose
GraphConfRec, a conference recommender system which combines SciGraph and graph
neural networks, to infer suggestions based not only on title and abstract, but
also on co-authorship and citation relationships. GraphConfRec achieves a
recall@10 of up to 0.580 and a MAP of up to 0.336 with a graph attention
network-based recommendation model. A user study with 25 subjects supports the
positive results.</span>

                                        <span>As predictive models are deployed into the real world, they must increasingly
contend with strategic behavior. A growing body of work on strategic
classification treats this problem as a Stackelberg game: the decision-maker
&quot;leads&quot; in the game by deploying a model, and the strategic agents &quot;follow&quot; by
playing their best response to the deployed model. Importantly, in this
framing, the burden of learning is placed solely on the decision-maker, while
the agents&#x27; best responses are implicitly treated as instantaneous. In this
work, we argue that the order of play in strategic classification is
fundamentally determined by the relative frequencies at which the
decision-maker and the agents adapt to each other&#x27;s actions. In particular, by
generalizing the standard model to allow both players to learn over time, we
show that a decision-maker that makes updates faster than the agents can
reverse the order of play, meaning that the agents lead and the decision-maker
follows. We observe in standard learning settings that such a role reversal can
be desirable for both the decision-maker and the strategic agents. Finally, we
show that a decision-maker with the freedom to choose their update frequency
can induce learning dynamics that converge to Stackelberg equilibria with
either order of play.</span>

                                        <span>We investigate the adversarial robustness of CNNs from the perspective of
channel-wise activations. By comparing \textit{non-robust} (normally trained)
and \textit{robustified} (adversarially trained) models, we observe that
adversarial training (AT) robustifies CNNs by aligning the channel-wise
activations of adversarial data with those of their natural counterparts.
However, the channels that are \textit{negatively-relevant} (NR) to predictions
are still over-activated when processing adversarial data. Besides, we also
observe that AT does not result in similar robustness for all classes. For the
robust classes, channels with larger activation magnitudes are usually more
\textit{positively-relevant} (PR) to predictions, but this alignment does not
hold for the non-robust classes. Given these observations, we hypothesize that
suppressing NR channels and aligning PR ones with their relevances further
enhances the robustness of CNNs under AT. To examine this hypothesis, we
introduce a novel mechanism, i.e., \underline{C}hannel-wise
\underline{I}mportance-based \underline{F}eature \underline{S}election (CIFS).
The CIFS manipulates channels&#x27; activations of certain layers by generating
non-negative multipliers to these channels based on their relevances to
predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR10 and
SVHN clearly verify the hypothesis and CIFS&#x27;s effectiveness of robustifying
CNNs.</span>

a non-time-aligned environment because most imitation learning methods aim to
imitate experts by following the demonstration step-by-step. However, aligned

propose a new imitation learning approach called Hierarchical Imitation
Learning from Observation(HILONet), which adopts a hierarchical structure to
choose feasible sub-goals from demonstrated observations dynamically. Our
method can solve all kinds of tasks by achieving these sub-goals, whether it
has a single goal position or not. We also present three different ways to
increase sample efficiency in the hierarchical structure. We conduct extensive

development of reliable autonomous vehicles in dense urban environments. The
interactions between vehicle and pedestrian or bicyclist have a significant
impact on the trajectories of traffic participants e.g. stopping or turning to
avoid collisions. Although recent datasets and trajectory prediction approaches
have fostered the development of autonomous vehicles yet the amount of
vehicle-pedestrian (bicyclist) interactions modeled are sparse. In this work,
we propose Euro-PVI, a dataset of pedestrian and bicyclist trajectories. In
particular, our dataset caters more diverse and complex interactions in dense
urban scenarios compared to the existing datasets. To address the challenges in
predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we develop a joint
inference model that learns an expressive multi-modal shared latent space
across agents in the urban scene. This enables our Joint-$\beta$-cVAE approach
to better model the distribution of future trajectories. We achieve state of
the art results on the nuScenes and Euro-PVI datasets demonstrating the
importance of capturing interactions between ego-vehicle and pedestrians
(bicyclists) for accurate predictions.</span>

exploration of the localization schemes of Awasthi~et~al.~(2017). We further

                                        <span>Recently, bound propagation based certified robust training methods have been
proposed for training neural networks with certifiable robustness guarantees.
Despite that state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including interval bound
propagation (IBP) and CROWN-IBP have per-batch training complexity similar to
standard neural network training, they usually use a long warmup schedule with
hundreds or thousands epochs to reach SOTA performance and are thus still
costly. In this paper, we identify two important issues in existing methods,
namely exploded bounds at initialization, and the imbalance in ReLU activation
states. These two issues make certified training difficult and unstable, and
thereby long warmup schedules were needed in prior works. To mitigate these
issues and conduct certified training with shorter warmup, we propose three
improvements: 1) We derive a new weight initialization method for IBP training;
2) We propose to fully add Batch Normalization (BN) to each layer in the model,
since we find BN can reduce the imbalance in ReLU activation states; 3) We also
design regularization to explicitly tighten certified bounds and balance ReLU
activation states. In our experiments, we are able to obtain 65.03% verified
error on CIFAR-10 ($\epsilon&#x3D;\frac{8}{255}$) and 82.36% verified error on
TinyImageNet ($\epsilon&#x3D;\frac{1}{255}$) using very short training schedules
(160 and 80 total epochs, respectively), outperforming literature SOTA trained
with hundreds or thousands epochs under the same network architecture.</span>

examples. Black-box attack is the most threatening attack. At present,
black-box attack methods mainly adopt gradient-based iterative attack methods,
which usually limit the relationship between the iteration step size, the
number of iterations, and the maximum perturbation. In this paper, we propose a
new gradient iteration framework, which redefines the relationship between the
above three. Under this framework, we easily improve the attack success rate of
DI-TI-MIM. In addition, we propose a gradient iterative attack method based on
input dropout, which can be well combined with our framework. We further
propose a multi dropout rate version of this method. Experimental results show
that our best method can achieve attack success rate of 96.2\% for defense
model on average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based
attacks.</span>

                                        <span>Data subset selection from a large number of training instances has been a
successful approach toward efficient and cost-effective machine learning.
However, models trained on a smaller subset may show poor generalization
ability. In this paper, our goal is to design an algorithm for selecting a
subset of the training data, so that the model can be trained quickly, without
significantly sacrificing on accuracy. More specifically, we focus on data
subset selection for L2 regularized regression problems and provide a novel
problem formulation which seeks to minimize the training loss with respect to
both the trainable parameters and the subset of training data, subject to error
bounds on the validation set. We tackle this problem using several technical
innovations. First, we represent this problem with simplified constraints using
the dual of the original training problem and show that the objective of this
new representation is a monotone and alpha-submodular function, for a wide
variety of modeling choices. Such properties lead us to develop SELCON, an
efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for data subset selection, that
admits an approximation guarantee even when the training provides an imperfect
estimate of the trained model. Finally, our experiments on several datasets
show that SELCON trades off accuracy and efficiency more effectively than the
current state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise efficient use of near-term
quantum computers. However, training VQAs often requires an extensive amount of
time and suffers from the barren plateau problem where the magnitude of the
gradients vanishes with increasing number of qubits. Here, we show how to
optimally train VQAs for learning quantum states. Parameterized quantum
circuits can form Gaussian kernels, which we use to derive adaptive learning
rates for gradient ascent. We introduce the generalized quantum natural
gradient that features stability and optimized movement in parameter space.
Both methods together outperform other optimization routines in training VQAs.
Our methods also excel at numerically optimizing driving protocols for quantum
control problems. The gradients of the VQA do not vanish when the fidelity
between the initial state and the state to be learned is bounded from below. We
identify a VQA for quantum simulation with such a constraint that thus can be
trained free of barren plateaus. Finally, we propose the application of
Gaussian kernels for quantum machine learning.</span>

                                        <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited in their expressive power, struggle
with long-range interactions and lack a principled way to model higher-order
structures. These problems can be attributed to the strong coupling between the
computational graph and the input graph structure. The recently proposed
Message Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by
performing message passing on the clique complex of the graph. Nevertheless,
these models are severely constrained by the rigid combinatorial structure of
Simplicial Complexes (SCs). In this work, we extend recent theoretical results
on SCs to regular Cell Complexes, topological objects that flexibly subsume SCs
and graphs. We show that this generalisation provides a powerful set of graph
&#x60;&#x60;lifting&#x27;&#x27; transformations, each leading to a unique hierarchical message
passing procedure. The resulting methods, which we collectively call CW
Networks (CWNs), are strictly more powerful than the WL test and, in certain
cases, not less powerful than the 3-WL test. In particular, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of one such scheme, based on rings, when applied to molecular
graph problems. The proposed architecture benefits from provably larger
expressivity than commonly used GNNs, principled modelling of higher-order
signals and from compressing the distances between nodes. We demonstrate that
our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of molecular datasets.</span>

                                        <span>The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot
scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works
focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the
original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity
Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be
applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the
dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional
encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional
encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can
incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to
accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the
kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional
encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized
attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity.
Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional
encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized
attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be
trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model
performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than
standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.</span>

Although various classification procedures are available, none of them can give
high accuracy in all applications. Therefore, in this paper, a novel
multi-classifier fusion approach is developed to boost the performance of the
individual classifiers. This is acquired by using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
However, in cases with conflicting evidences, the DST may give
counter-intuitive results. In this regard, a preprocessing technique based on a
new metric is devised in order to measure and mitigate the conflict between the
evidences. To evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
the method is applied to 15 benchmarks datasets from UCI and KEEL. Further, it
is applied for classifying polycrystalline Nickel alloy first-stage turbine
blades based on their broadband vibrational response. Through statistical
analysis with different noise levels, and by comparing with four
state-of-the-art fusion techniques, it is shown that that the proposed method
improves the classification accuracy and outperforms the individual
classifiers.</span>

procedural modeling, i.e. generating geometry using programs. Such programs
consist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter
values. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program
should be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful
manipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design
higher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of
commands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring
such macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely
restricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm
for automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of
3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an
imperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that
make programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free
parameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on
multiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D
shape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of
macros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that
generalize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros
found by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape
generative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we
conduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD&#x27;s discovered macros make
interactive shape editing more efficient.</span>

                                        <span>We study {\em online} active learning of homogeneous halfspaces in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with adversarial noise where the overall probability of a noisy
label is constrained to be at most $\nu$. Our main contribution is a
Perceptron-like online active learning algorithm that runs in polynomial time,
and under the conditions that the marginal distribution is isotropic
log-concave and $\nu &#x3D; \Omega(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is the
target error rate, our algorithm PAC learns the underlying halfspace with
near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\big(d \cdot
polylog(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\big)$ and sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{d}{\epsilon} \big)$. Prior to this work, existing online
algorithms designed for tolerating the adversarial noise are subject to either
label complexity polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, or suboptimal noise
tolerance, or restrictive marginal distributions. With the additional prior
knowledge that the underlying halfspace is $s$-sparse, we obtain
attribute-efficient label complexity of $\tilde{O}\big( s \cdot polylog(d,
\frac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$ and sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{s}{\epsilon} \cdot polylog(d) \big)$. As an immediate
corollary, we show that under the agnostic model where no assumption is made on
the noise rate $\nu$, our active learner achieves an error rate of $O(OPT) +
\epsilon$ with the same running time and label and sample complexity, where
$OPT$ is the best possible error rate achievable by any homogeneous halfspace.</span>

                                        <span>Climate models are critical tools for developing strategies to manage the
risks posed by sea-level rise to coastal communities. While these models are
necessary for understanding climate risks, there is a level of uncertainty
inherent in each parameter in the models. This model parametric uncertainty
leads to uncertainty in future climate risks. Consequently, there is a need to
understand how those parameter uncertainties impact our assessment of future
climate risks and the efficacy of strategies to manage them. Here, we use
random forests to examine the parametric drivers of future climate risk and how
the relative importances of those drivers change over time. We find that the
equilibrium climate sensitivity and a factor that scales the effect of aerosols
on radiative forcing are consistently the most important climate model
parametric uncertainties throughout the 2020 to 2150 interval for both low and
high radiative forcing scenarios. The near-term hazards of high-end sea-level
rise are driven primarily by thermal expansion, while the longer-term hazards
are associated with mass loss from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Our
results highlight the practical importance of considering time-evolving
parametric uncertainties when developing strategies to manage future climate
risks.</span>

random latent vectors. Although manipulating the latent vectors controls the
synthesized outputs, editing real images with GANs suffers from i)
time-consuming optimization for projecting real images to the latent vectors,
ii) or inaccurate embedding through an encoder. We propose StyleMapGAN: the
intermediate latent space has spatial dimensions, and a spatially variant
modulation replaces AdaIN. It makes the embedding through an encoder more
accurate than existing optimization-based methods while maintaining the
properties of GANs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in various image manipulation

                                        <span>Fluorescence microscopy allows for a detailed inspection of cells, cellular
networks, and anatomical landmarks by staining with a variety of
carefully-selected markers visualized as color channels. Quantitative
characterization of structures in acquired images often relies on automatic
image analysis methods. Despite the success of deep learning methods in other
vision applications, their potential for fluorescence image analysis remains
underexploited. One reason lies in the considerable workload required to train
accurate models, which are normally specific for a given combination of
markers, and therefore applicable to a very restricted number of experimental
settings. We herein propose Marker Sampling and Excite, a neural network
approach with a modality sampling strategy and a novel attention module that
together enable (i) flexible training with heterogeneous datasets with
combinations of markers and (ii) successful utility of learned models on
arbitrary subsets of markers prospectively. We show that our single neural
network solution performs comparably to an upper bound scenario where an
ensemble of many networks is na\&quot;ively trained for each possible marker
combination separately. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this
framework in high-throughput biological analysis by revising a recent
quantitative characterization of bone marrow vasculature in 3D confocal
microscopy datasets and further confirm the validity of our approach on an
additional, significantly different dataset of microvessels in fetal liver
tissues. Not only can our work substantially ameliorate the use of deep
learning in fluorescence microscopy analysis, but it can also be utilized in
other fields with incomplete data acquisitions and missing modalities.</span>

framework for reinforcement learning based on Bregman divergences and momentum
techniques. Specifically, we propose a Bregman gradient policy optimization
(BGPO) algorithm based on the basic momentum technique and mirror descent
iteration. At the same time, we present an accelerated Bregman gradient policy
optimization (VR-BGPO) algorithm based on a momentum variance-reduced
technique. Moreover, we introduce a convergence analysis framework for our
Bregman gradient policy optimization under the nonconvex setting. Specifically,
we prove that BGPO achieves the sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$
for finding $\epsilon$-stationary point only requiring one trajectory at each
iteration, and VR-BGPO reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, which
also only requires one trajectory at each iteration. In particular, by using
different Bregman divergences, our methods unify many existing policy
optimization algorithms and their new variants such as the existing
(variance-reduced) policy gradient algorithms and (variance-reduced) natural
policy gradient algorithms. Extensive experimental results on multiple

connections between nodes and nodes&#x27; cluster memberships may change over time,
e.g., due to community migration. We first propose a dynamic stochastic block
model that captures these changes, and a simple decay-based clustering
algorithm that clusters nodes based on weighted connections between them, where
the weight decreases at a fixed rate over time. This decay rate can then be
interpreted as signifying the importance of including historical connection
information in the clustering. However, the optimal decay rate may differ for
clusters with different rates of turnover. We characterize the optimal decay
rate for each cluster and propose a clustering method that achieves almost
exact recovery of the true clusters. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our
clustering algorithm with optimized decay rates on simulated graph data.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a popular algorithm for sequence learning,
use a similar decay-based method, and we use this insight to propose two new

                                        <span>Tensor decompositions are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction and
feature interpretation of multidimensional data such as signals. Existing
tensor decomposition objectives (e.g., Frobenius norm) are designed for fitting
raw data under statistical assumptions, which may not align with downstream
classification tasks. Also, real-world tensor data are usually high-ordered and
have large dimensions with millions or billions of entries. Thus, it is
expensive to decompose the whole tensor with traditional algorithms. In
practice, raw tensor data also contains redundant information while data
augmentation techniques may be used to smooth out noise in samples. This paper
addresses the above challenges by proposing augmented tensor decomposition
(ATD), which effectively incorporates data augmentations to boost downstream
classification. To reduce the memory footprint of the decomposition, we propose
a stochastic algorithm that updates the factor matrices in a batch fashion. We
evaluate ATD on multiple signal datasets. It shows comparable or better
performance (e.g., up to 15% in accuracy) over self-supervised and autoencoder
baselines with less than 5% of model parameters, achieves 0.6% ~ 1.3% accuracy
gain over other tensor-based baselines, and reduces the memory footprint by 9X
when compared to standard tensor decomposition algorithms.</span>

work has shown that neural networks are capable of producing sketches of
natural objects drawn from a small number of classes. While earlier approaches
focus on generation quality or retrieval, we explore properties of image
representations learned by training a model to produce sketches of images. We
show that this generative, class-agnostic model produces informative embeddings
of images from novel examples, classes, and even novel datasets in a few-shot

interesting structure and compositionality.</span>

                                        <span>Attribution methods have been shown as promising approaches for identifying
key features that led to learned model predictions. While most existing
attribution methods rely on a baseline input for performing feature
perturbations, limited research has been conducted to address the baseline
selection issues. Poor choices of baselines limit the ability of one-vs-one
(1-vs-1) explanations for multi-class classifiers, which means the attribution
methods were not able to explain why an input belongs to its original class but
not the other specified target class. 1-vs-1 explanation is crucial when
certain classes are more similar than others, e.g. two bird types among
multiple animals, by focusing on key differentiating features rather than
shared features across classes. In this paper, we present GAN-based Model
EXplainability (GANMEX), a novel approach applying Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) by incorporating the to-be-explained classifier as part of the
adversarial networks. Our approach effectively selects the counterfactual
baseline as the closest realistic sample belong to the target class, which
allows attribution methods to provide true 1-vs-1 explanations. We showed that
GANMEX baselines improved the saliency maps and led to stronger performance on
perturbation-based evaluation metrics over the existing baselines. Existing
attribution results are known for being insensitive to model randomization, and
we demonstrated that GANMEX baselines led to better outcome under the cascading
randomization of the model.</span>

                                        <span>Methods that sparsify a network at initialization are important in practice
because they greatly improve the efficiency of both learning and inference. Our
work is based on a recently proposed decomposition of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) that has decoupled the dynamics of the training process into a
data-dependent component and an architecture-dependent kernel - the latter
referred to as Path Kernel. That work has shown how to design sparse neural
networks for faster convergence, without any training data, using the
Synflow-L2 algorithm. We first show that even though Synflow-L2 is optimal in
terms of convergence, for a given network density, it results in sub-networks
with &quot;bottleneck&quot; (narrow) layers - leading to poor performance as compared to
other data-agnostic methods that use the same number of parameters. Then we
propose a new method to construct sparse networks, without any training data,
referred to as Paths with Higher-Edge Weights (PHEW). PHEW is a probabilistic
network formation method based on biased random walks that only depends on the
initial weights. It has similar path kernel properties as Synflow-L2 but it
generates much wider layers, resulting in better generalization and
performance. PHEW achieves significant improvements over the data-independent
SynFlow and SynFlow-L2 methods at a wide range of network densities.</span>

                                        <span>Generative Adversarial Networks are notoriously challenging to train. The
underlying minmax optimization is highly susceptible to the variance of the
stochastic gradient and the rotational component of the associated game vector
field. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Lookahead algorithm for
minmax optimization, originally developed for single objective minimization
only. The backtracking step of our Lookahead-minmax naturally handles the
rotational game dynamics, a property which was identified to be key for
enabling gradient ascent descent methods to converge on challenging examples
often analyzed in the literature. Moreover, it implicitly handles high variance
without using large mini-batches, known to be essential for reaching state of
the art performance. Experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and
ImageNet demonstrate a clear advantage of combining Lookahead-minmax with Adam
or extragradient, in terms of performance and improved stability, for
negligible memory and computational cost. Using 30-fold fewer parameters and
16-fold smaller minibatches we outperform the reported performance of the
class-dependent BigGAN on CIFAR-10 by obtaining FID of 12.19 without using the
class labels, bringing state-of-the-art GAN training within reach of common
computational resources.</span>

process that diffuses data to noise, and are trained by minimizing a weighted
combination of score matching losses. The log-likelihood of score-based models
can be tractably computed through a connection to continuous normalizing flows,
but log-likelihood is not directly optimized by the weighted combination of
score matching losses. We show that for a specific weighting scheme, the
objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood, thus enabling approximate
maximum likelihood training of score-based models. We empirically observe that
maximum likelihood training consistently improves the likelihood of score-based
models across multiple datasets, stochastic processes, and model architectures.
Our best models achieve negative log-likelihoods of 2.74 and 3.76 bits/dim on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32, outperforming autoregressive models on these

installed. However, recent supply-chain attacks demonstrate that application
integrity must be ensured during installation itself. We introduce SIGL, a new
tool for detecting malicious behavior during software installation. SIGL
collects traces of system call activity, building a data provenance graph that
it analyzes using a novel autoencoder architecture with a graph long short-term
memory network (graph LSTM) for the encoder and a standard multilayer
perceptron for the decoder. SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the
specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a
test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we
demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar
systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45%
in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most
likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms
and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and
adversarial attack. It can be used with application-specific models, even in
the presence of new software versions, as well as application-agnostic
meta-models that encompass a wide range of applications and installers.</span>

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model&#x27;s architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) to forecast
dominant wave periods in oceanic waters. First, we use the data collected from
CDIP buoys and apply various data filtering methods. The data filtering methods
allow us to obtain a high-quality dataset for training and validation purposes.
We then extract various wave-based features like wave heights, periods,
skewness, kurtosis, etc., and atmospheric features like humidity, pressure, and
air temperature for the buoys. Afterward, we train algorithms that use LightGBM
and Extra Trees through a hv-block cross-validation scheme to forecast dominant
wave periods for up to 30 days ahead. LightGBM has the R2 score of 0.94, 0.94,
and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. Similarly,
Extra Trees (ET) has an R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day ahead,
15-day ahead, and 30 day ahead prediction. In case of the test dataset,
LightGBM has R2 score of 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead and
30-day ahead prediction. ET has R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day
ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. A similar R2 score for both
training and the test dataset suggests that the machine learning models
developed in this paper are robust. Since the LightGBM algorithm outperforms ET
for all the windows tested, it is taken as the final algorithm. Note that the
performance of both methods does not decrease significantly as the forecast
horizon increases. Likewise, the proposed method outperforms the numerical
approaches included in this paper in the test dataset. For 1 day ahead
prediction, the proposed algorithm has SI, Bias, CC, and RMSE of 0.09, 0.00,
0.97, and 1.78 compared to 0.268, 0.40, 0.63, and 2.18 for the European Centre
for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, which outperforms all the
other methods in the test dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in scanning tunneling and transmission electron microscopies
(STM and STEM) have allowed routine generation of large volumes of imaging data
containing information on the structure and functionality of materials. The
experimental data sets contain signatures of long-range phenomena such as
physical order parameter fields, polarization and strain gradients in STEM, or
standing electronic waves and carrier-mediated exchange interactions in STM,
all superimposed onto scanning system distortions and gradual changes of
contrast due to drift and/or mis-tilt effects. Correspondingly, while the human
eye can readily identify certain patterns in the images such as lattice
periodicities, repeating structural elements, or microstructures, their
automatic extraction and classification are highly non-trivial and universal
pathways to accomplish such analyses are absent. We pose that the most
distinctive elements of the patterns observed in STM and (S)TEM images are
similarity and (almost-) periodicity, behaviors stemming directly from the
parsimony of elementary atomic structures, superimposed on the gradual changes
reflective of order parameter distributions. However, the discovery of these
elements via global Fourier methods is non-trivial due to variability and lack
of ideal discrete translation symmetry. To address this problem, we develop
shift-invariant variational autoencoders (shift-VAE) that allow disentangling
characteristic repeating features in the images, their variations, and shifts
inevitable for random sampling of image space. Shift-VAEs balance the
uncertainty in the position of the object of interest with the uncertainty in
shape reconstruction. This approach is illustrated for model 1D data, and
further extended to synthetic and experimental STM and STEM 2D data.</span>

                                        <span>Dynamical variational auto-encoders (DVAEs) are a class of deep generative
models with latent variables, dedicated to time series data modeling. DVAEs can
be considered as extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) that include
the modeling of temporal dependencies between successive observed and/or latent
vectors in data sequences. Previous work has shown the interest of DVAEs and
their better performance over the VAE for speech signals (spectrogram)
modeling. Independently, the VAE has been successfully applied to speech
enhancement in noise, in an unsupervised noise-agnostic set-up that does not
require the use of a parallel dataset of clean and noisy speech samples for
training, but only requires clean speech signals. In this paper, we extend
those works to DVAE-based single-channel unsupervised speech enhancement, hence
exploiting both speech signals unsupervised representation learning and
dynamics modeling. We propose an unsupervised speech enhancement algorithm
based on the most general form of DVAEs, that we then adapt to three specific
DVAE models to illustrate the versatility of the framework. More precisely, we
combine DVAE-based speech priors with a noise model based on nonnegative matrix
factorization, and we derive a variational expectation-maximization (VEM)
algorithm to perform speech enhancement. Experimental results show that the
proposed approach based on DVAEs outperforms its VAE counterpart and a
supervised speech enhancement baseline.</span>

care industry, sports, rehabilitation and fitness assessment), sufficiently
valid and reliable gait parameter measurement is still limited to high-tech
gait laboratories mostly. Here, we demonstrate the excellent validity and
test-retest repeatability of a novel gait assessment system which is built upon
modern convolutional neural networks to extract three-dimensional skeleton
joints from monocular frontal-view videos of walking humans. The validity study
is based on a comparison to the GAITRite pressure-sensitive walkway system. All
measured gait parameters (gait speed, cadence, step length and step time)
showed excellent concurrent validity for multiple walk trials at normal and
fast gait speeds. The test-retest-repeatability is on the same level as the
GAITRite system. In conclusion, we are convinced that our results can pave the
way for cost, space and operationally effective gait analysis in broad
mainstream applications. Most sensor-based systems are costly, must be operated
by extensively trained personnel (e.g., motion capture systems) or - even if
not quite as costly - still possess considerable complexity (e.g., wearable
sensors). In contrast, a video sufficient for the assessment method presented

the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible
transformations. Yet, modeling long-range dependencies over normalizing flows
remains understudied. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce two types of
invertible attention mechanisms for generative flow models. To be precise, we
propose map-based and scaled dot-product attention for unconditional and
conditional generative flow models. The key idea is to exploit split-based
attention mechanisms to learn the attention weights and input representations
on every two splits of flow feature maps. Our method provides invertible
attention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling seamless
integration of it at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed
attention mechanism can model the global data dependencies, leading to more
comprehensive flow models. Evaluation on multiple generation tasks demonstrates
that the introduced attention flow idea results in efficient flow models and
compares favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional
generative flow methods.</span>

attain the balance between exploration and exploitation. Due to the superior
performance and low feedback learning without the learning to act in multiple
situations, Multi-armed Bandits drawing widespread attention in applications
ranging such as recommender systems. Likewise, within the recommender system,
collaborative filtering (CF) is arguably the earliest and most influential
method in the recommender system. Crucially, new users and an ever-changing
pool of recommended items are the challenges that recommender systems need to
address. For collaborative filtering, the classical method is training the
model offline, then perform the online testing, but this approach can no longer
handle the dynamic changes in user preferences which is the so-called cold
start. So how to effectively recommend items to users in the absence of
effective information? To address the aforementioned problems, a multi-armed
bandit based collaborative filtering recommender system has been proposed,
named BanditMF. BanditMF is designed to address two challenges in the
multi-armed bandits algorithm and collaborative filtering: (1) how to solve the
cold start problem for collaborative filtering under the condition of scarcity
of valid information, (2) how to solve the sub-optimal problem of bandit
algorithms in strong social relations domains caused by independently
estimating unknown parameters associated with each user and ignoring
correlations between users.</span>

                                        <span>An increasingly common setting in machine learning involves multiple parties,
each with their own data, who want to jointly make predictions on future test
points. Agents wish to benefit from the collective expertise of the full set of
agents to make better predictions than they would individually, but may not be
willing to release their data or model parameters. In this work, we explore a
decentralized mechanism to make collective predictions at test time, leveraging
each agent&#x27;s pre-trained model without relying on external validation, model
retraining, or data pooling. Our approach takes inspiration from the literature
in social science on human consensus-making. We analyze our mechanism
theoretically, showing that it converges to inverse meansquared-error (MSE)
weighting in the large-sample limit. To compute error bars on the collective
predictions we propose a decentralized Jackknife procedure that evaluates the
sensitivity of our mechanism to a single agent&#x27;s prediction. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our scheme effectively combines models with differing quality
across the input space. The proposed consensus prediction achieves significant
gains over classical model averaging, and even outperforms weighted averaging
schemes that have access to additional validation data.</span>

                                        <span>This paper deals with the problem of localization in a cellular network in a
dense urban scenario. Global Navigation Satellite Systems typically perform
poorly in urban environments, where the likelihood of line-of-sight conditions
between the devices and the satellites is low, and thus alternative
localization methods are required for good accuracy. We present a deep learning
method for localization, based merely on pathloss, which does not require any
increase in computation complexity at the user devices with respect to the
device standard operations, unlike methods that rely on time of arrival or
angle of arrival information. In a wireless network, user devices scan the base
station beacon slots and identify the few strongest base station signals for
handover and user-base station association purposes. In the proposed method,
the user to be localized simply reports such received signal strengths to a
central processing unit, which may be located in the cloud. For each base
station we have good approximation of the pathloss at every location in a dense
grid in the map. This approximation is provided by RadioUNet, a deep
learning-based simulator of pathloss functions in urban environment, that we
have previously proposed and published. Using the estimated pathloss radio maps
of all base stations and the corresponding reported signal strengths, the
proposed deep learning algorithm can extract a very accurate localization of
the user. The proposed method, called LocUNet, enjoys high robustness to
inaccuracies in the estimated radio maps. We demonstrate this by numerical
experiments, which obtain state-of-the-art results.</span>

In this paper we introduce OpenML-Python, a client API for Python, opening up
the OpenML platform for a wide range of Python-based tools. It provides easy
access to all datasets, tasks and experiments on OpenML from within Python. It
also provides functionality to conduct machine learning experiments, upload the

                                        <span>Deep generative models have recently demonstrated the ability to synthesize
photorealistic images of human faces with novel identities. A key challenge to
the wide applicability of such techniques is to provide independent control
over semantically meaningful parameters: appearance, head pose, face shape, and
facial expressions. In this paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our
knowledge the first method that learns a variational latent feature space of
neural face textures, which allows sampling of novel identities. We combine
this generative model with a parametric face model and gain explicit control
over head pose and facial expressions. To generate images of complete human
heads, we propose an additive decoder that generates plausible additional
details such as hair. A novel training scheme enforces a pose independent
latent space and in consequence, allows learning of a one-to-many mapping
between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions. The resulting
method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel identities
allowing fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial
expressions, facilitating a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling
novel identities, re-posing, expression transfer, and more.</span>

                                        <span>Minimizing cross-entropy over the softmax scores of a linear map composed
with a high-capacity encoder is arguably the most popular choice for training
neural networks on supervised learning tasks. However, recent works show that
one can directly optimize the encoder instead, to obtain equally (or even more)
discriminative representations via a supervised variant of a contrastive
objective. In this work, we address the question whether there are fundamental
differences in the sought-for representation geometry in the output space of
the encoder at minimal loss. Specifically, we prove, under mild assumptions,
that both losses attain their minimum once the representations of each class
collapse to the vertices of a regular simplex, inscribed in a hypersphere. We
provide empirical evidence that this configuration is attained in practice and
that reaching a close-to-optimal state typically indicates good generalization
performance. Yet, the two losses show remarkably different optimization
behavior. The number of iterations required to perfectly fit to data scales
superlinearly with the amount of randomly flipped labels for the supervised
contrastive loss. This is in contrast to the approximately linear scaling
previously reported for networks trained with cross-entropy.</span>

                                        <span>Social learning is a key component of human and animal intelligence. By
taking cues from the behavior of experts in their environment, social learners
can acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to new circumstances. This
paper investigates whether independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a
multi-agent environment can learn to use social learning to improve their
performance. We find that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents
do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons for this deficiency, and
show that by imposing constraints on the training environment and introducing a
model-based auxiliary loss we are able to obtain generalized social learning
policies which enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are not
learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt online to novel environments
by taking cues from experts present in the new environment. In contrast, agents
trained with model-free RL or imitation learning generalize poorly and do not
succeed in the transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo training, we can
obtain agents that use social learning to gain skills that they can deploy when
alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from the start.</span>

                                        <span>Imitation learning is an effective and safe technique to train robot policies
in the real world because it does not depend on an expensive random exploration
process. However, due to the lack of exploration, learning policies that
generalize beyond the demonstrated behaviors is still an open challenge. We
present a novel imitation learning framework to enable robots to 1) learn
complex real world manipulation tasks efficiently from a small number of human
demonstrations, and 2) synthesize new behaviors not contained in the collected
demonstrations. Our key insight is that multi-task domains often present a
latent structure, where demonstrated trajectories for different tasks intersect
at common regions of the state space. We present Generalization Through
Imitation (GTI), a two-stage offline imitation learning algorithm that exploits
this intersecting structure to train goal-directed policies that generalize to
unseen start and goal state combinations. In the first stage of GTI, we train a
stochastic policy that leverages trajectory intersections to have the capacity
to compose behaviors from different demonstration trajectories together. In the
second stage of GTI, we collect a small set of rollouts from the unconditioned
stochastic policy of the first stage, and train a goal-directed agent to
generalize to novel start and goal configurations. We validate GTI in both
simulated domains and a challenging long-horizon robotic manipulation domain in
the real world. Additional results and videos are available at

                                        <span>As machine learning models are increasingly used in critical decision-making
settings (e.g., healthcare, finance), there has been a growing emphasis on
developing methods to explain model predictions. Such \textit{explanations} are
used to understand and establish trust in models and are vital components in
machine learning pipelines. Though explanations are a critical piece in these
systems, there is little understanding about how they are vulnerable to
manipulation by adversaries. In this paper, we discuss how two broad classes of
explanations are vulnerable to manipulation. We demonstrate how adversaries can
design biased models that manipulate model agnostic feature attribution methods
(e.g., LIME \&amp; SHAP) and counterfactual explanations that hill-climb during the
counterfactual search (e.g., Wachter&#x27;s Algorithm \&amp; DiCE) into
\textit{concealing} the model&#x27;s biases. These vulnerabilities allow an
adversary to deploy a biased model, yet explanations will not reveal this bias,
thereby deceiving stakeholders into trusting the model. We evaluate the
manipulations on real world data sets, including COMPAS and Communities \&amp;
Crime, and find explanations can be manipulated in practice.</span>

(RNN) models as post-processing units for the compensation of fibre
nonlinearities in digital coherent systems carrying polarization multiplexed
16-QAM and 32-QAM signals. We evaluate three bi-directional RNN models, namely
the bi-LSTM, bi-GRU and bi-Vanilla-RNN and show that all of them are promising
nonlinearity compensators especially in dispersion unmanaged systems. Our
simulations show that during inference the three models provide similar
compensation performance, therefore in real-life systems the simplest scheme
based on Vanilla-RNN units should be preferred. We compare bi-Vanilla-RNN with
Volterra nonlinear equalizers and exhibit its superiority both in terms of
performance and complexity, thus highlighting that RNN processing is a very
promising pathway for the upgrade of long-haul optical communication systems
utilizing coherent detection.</span>

patients where the annotated data is limited or unavailable. There have been
several attempts to use gradient-based attribution methods to localize
pathology from medical scans without using segmentation labels. This research
direction has been impeded by the lack of robustness and reliability. These
methods are highly sensitive to the network parameters. In this study, we
introduce a robust visual explanation method to address this problem for
medical applications. We provide an innovative visual explanation algorithm for
general purpose and as an example application, we demonstrate its effectiveness
for quantifying lesions in the lungs caused by the Covid-19 with high accuracy
and robustness without using dense segmentation labels. This approach overcomes
the drawbacks of commonly used Grad-CAM and its extended versions. The premise
behind our proposed strategy is that the information flow is minimized while
ensuring the classifier prediction stays similar. Our findings indicate that
the bottleneck condition provides a more stable severity estimation than the
similar attribution methods.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to
small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat
and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models.
With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar
investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that
adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in
a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from
a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a
few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through
flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found
for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad
actors &#x60;&#x60;anchor nodes&#x27;&#x27; and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them.
Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the
anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the
intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success
rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor
nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other
three models.</span>

                                        <span>Recent studies show a close connection between neural networks (NN) and
kernel methods. However, most of these analyses (e.g., NTK) focus on the
influence of (infinite) width instead of the depth of NN models. There remains
a gap between theory and practical network designs that benefit from the depth.
This paper first proposes a novel kernel family named Neural Optimization
Kernel (NOK). Our kernel is defined as the inner product between two $T$-step
updated functionals in RKHS w.r.t. a regularized optimization problem.
Theoretically, we proved the monotonic descent property of our update rule for
both convex and non-convex problems, and a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate of our
updates for convex problems. Moreover, we propose a data-dependent structured
approximation of our NOK, which builds the connection between training deep NNs
and kernel methods associated with NOK. The resultant computational graph is a
ResNet-type finite width NN. Our structured approximation preserved the
monotonic descent property and $O(1/T)$ convergence rate. Namely, a $T$-layer
NN performs $T$-step monotonic descent updates. Notably, we show our
$T$-layered structured NN with ReLU maintains a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate
w.r.t. a convex regularized problem, which explains the success of ReLU on
training deep NN from a NN architecture optimization perspective. For the
unsupervised learning and the shared parameter case, we show the equivalence of
training structured NN with GD and performing functional gradient descent in
RKHS associated with a fixed (data-dependent) NOK at an infinity-width regime.
For finite NOKs, we prove generalization bounds. Remarkably, we show that
overparameterized deep NN (NOK) can increase the expressive power to reduce
empirical risk and reduce the generalization bound at the same time. Extensive
experiments verify the robustness of our structured NOK blocks.</span>

low edge-compute inference of neural networks but might expose sensitive
information about the test query to the server. To address this problem,
existing techniques train the model to minimize information leakage for a given
set of sensitive attributes. In practice, however, the test queries might
contain attributes that are not foreseen during training. We propose instead an
unsupervised obfuscation method to discard the information irrelevant to the
main task. We formulate the problem via an information theoretical framework
and derive an analytical solution for a given distortion to the model output.
In our method, the edge device runs the model up to a split layer determined
based on its computational capacity. It then obfuscates the obtained feature
vector based on the first layer of the server model by removing the components
in the null space as well as the low-energy components of the remaining signal.
Our experimental results show that our method outperforms existing techniques
in removing the information of the irrelevant attributes and maintaining the
accuracy on the target label. We also show that our method reduces the
communication cost and incurs only a small computational overhead.</span>

understand how the network will learn and generalize. One natural measure of
complexity is how the network distorts length - if the network takes a
unit-length curve as input, what is the length of the resulting curve of
outputs? It has been widely believed that this length grows exponentially in
network depth. We prove that in fact this is not the case: the expected length
distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU
networks with standard random initialization. We also generalize this result by
proving upper bounds both for higher moments of the length distortion and for
the distortion of higher-dimensional volumes. These theoretical results are
corroborated by our experiments.</span>

algorithm for forecasting Significant Wave Heights in oceanic waters. To derive
multiple features from the CDIP buoys, which make point measurements, we first
nowcast various parameters and then forecast them at 30-min intervals. The
proposed algorithm has Scatter Index (SI), Bias, Correlation Coefficient, Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.130, -0.002, 0.97, and 0.14, respectively, for
one day ahead prediction and 0.110, -0.001, 0.98, and 0.122, respectively, for
14-day ahead prediction on the testing dataset. While other state-of-the-art
methods can only forecast up to 120 hours ahead, we extend it further to 14
days. Our proposed setup includes spectral features, hv-block cross-validation,
and stringent QC criteria. The proposed algorithm performs significantly better
than the state-of-the-art methods commonly used for significant wave height
forecasting for one-day ahead prediction. Moreover, the improved performance of
the proposed machine learning method compared to the numerical methods shows
that this performance can be extended to even longer periods allowing for early
prediction of significant wave heights in oceanic waters.</span>

                                        <span>Biological systems perceive the world by simultaneously processing
high-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch,
proprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other
hand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific
assumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all
existing vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but
also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the
Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few
architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that
also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model
leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into
a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We
show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong,
specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images,
point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance
comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly
attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in
AudioSet.</span>

very large numbers of statistical queries like $k$-way marginals, subject to
differential privacy. Our algorithm makes adaptive use of a continuous
relaxation of the Projection Mechanism, which answers queries on the private
dataset using simple perturbation, and then attempts to find the synthetic
dataset that most closely matches the noisy answers. We use a continuous
relaxation of the synthetic dataset domain which makes the projection loss
differentiable, and allows us to use efficient ML optimization techniques and
tooling. Rather than answering all queries up front, we make judicious use of
our privacy budget by iteratively and adaptively finding queries for which our
(relaxed) synthetic data has high error, and then repeating the projection. We
perform extensive experimental evaluations across a range of parameters and
datasets, and find that our method outperforms existing algorithms in many

                                        <span>This paper primarily focuses on computing the Euclidean projection of a
vector onto the $\ell_{p}$ ball in which $p\in(0,1)$. Such a problem emerges as
the core building block in statistical machine learning and signal processing
tasks because of its ability to promote sparsity. However, efficient numerical
algorithms for finding the projections are still not available, particularly in
large-scale optimization. To meet this challenge, we first derive the
first-order necessary optimality conditions of this problem using Fr\&#x27;echet
normal cone. Based on this characterization, we develop a novel numerical
approach for computing the stationary point through solving a sequence of
projections onto the reweighted $\ell_{1}$-balls. This method is practically
simple to implement and computationally efficient. Moreover, the proposed
algorithm is shown to converge uniquely under mild conditions and has a
worst-case $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>This work explores the signal awareness of AI models for source code
understanding. Using a software vulnerability detection use case, we evaluate
the models&#x27; ability to capture the correct vulnerability signals to produce
their predictions. Our prediction-preserving input minimization (P2IM) approach
systematically reduces the original source code to a minimal snippet which a
model needs to maintain its prediction. The model&#x27;s reliance on incorrect
signals is then uncovered when the vulnerability in the original code is
missing in the minimal snippet, both of which the model however predicts as
being vulnerable. We measure the signal awareness of models using a new metric
we propose- Signal-aware Recall (SAR). We apply P2IM on three different neural
network architectures across multiple datasets. The results show a sharp drop
in the model&#x27;s Recall from the high 90s to sub-60s with the new metric,
highlighting that the models are presumably picking up a lot of noise or
dataset nuances while learning their vulnerability detection logic. Although
the drop in model performance may be perceived as an adversarial attack, but
this isn&#x27;t P2IM&#x27;s objective. The idea is rather to uncover the signal-awareness
of a black-box model in a data-driven manner via controlled queries. SAR&#x27;s
purpose is to measure the impact of task-agnostic model training, and not to
suggest a shortcoming in the Recall metric. The expectation, in fact, is for
SAR to match Recall in the ideal scenario where the model truly captures
task-specific signals.</span>

and the Poisson Lee-Carter model on multiple populations. We develop some
neural networks that replicate the structure of the individual LC models and
allow their joint fitting by analysing the mortality data of all the considered
populations simultaneously. The neural network architecture is specifically
designed to calibrate each individual model using all available information
instead of using a population-specific subset of data as in the traditional
estimation schemes. A large set of numerical experiments performed on all the
countries of the Human Mortality Database (HMD) shows the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, the resulting parameter estimates appear smooth and
less sensitive to the random fluctuations often present in the mortality rates&#x27;
data, especially for low-population countries. In addition, the forecasting
performance results significantly improved as well.</span>

networks typically yield uncalibrated predictions, calibrated confidence scores
that are representative of the true likelihood of a prediction can be achieved
using post-hoc calibration methods. However, to date the focus of these
approaches has been on in-domain calibration. Our contribution is two-fold.
First, we show that existing post-hoc calibration methods yield highly
over-confident predictions under domain shift. Second, we introduce a simple
strategy where perturbations are applied to samples in the validation set
before performing the post-hoc calibration step. In extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that this perturbation step results in substantially better

perspective of regret minimization. Unlike most prior work in this area, we
focus on the problem of designing an online controller which competes with the
optimal dynamic sequence of control actions selected in hindsight, instead of
the best controller in some specific class of controllers. This formulation of
regret is attractive when the environment changes over time and no single
controller achieves good performance over the entire time horizon. We show that
in the measurement-feedback setting, unlike in the full-information setting,
there is no single offline controller which outperforms every other offline
controller on every disturbance, and propose a new $H_2$-optimal offline
controller as a benchmark for the online controller to compete against. We show
that the corresponding regret-optimal online controller can be found via a
novel reduction to the classical Nehari problem from robust control and present
a tight data-dependent bound on its regret.</span>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

illumination. Our system is designed to handle fully dynamic scenes, and makes
no assumptions about the lighting, geometry, and materials. The data-driven
nature of our approach sidesteps many difficulties of caching algorithms, such
as locating, interpolating, and updating cache points. Since pretraining neural
networks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalization
challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve generalization via
adaptation, i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We
employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate
infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The
updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead -- about 2.6ms on full HD
resolution -- thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that
fully exploits modern hardware. We demonstrate significant noise reduction at
the cost of little induced bias, and report state-of-the-art, real-time
performance on a number of challenging scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Learning a sequence of tasks without access to i.i.d. observations is a
widely studied form of continual learning (CL) that remains challenging. In
principle, Bayesian learning directly applies to this setting, since recursive
and one-off Bayesian updates yield the same result. In practice, however,
recursive updating often leads to poor trade-off solutions across tasks because
approximate inference is necessary for most models of interest. Here, we
describe an alternative Bayesian approach where task-conditioned parameter
distributions are continually inferred from data. We offer a practical deep
learning implementation of our framework based on probabilistic
task-conditioned hypernetworks, an approach we term &quot;posterior meta-replay&quot;.
Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our probabilistic hypernetworks
compress sequences of posterior parameter distributions with virtually no
forgetting. We obtain considerable performance gains compared to existing
Bayesian CL methods, and identify task inference as our major limiting factor.
This limitation has several causes that are independent of the considered
sequential setting, opening up new avenues for progress in CL.</span>

Brazilian legal proceedings in three possible classes of status: (i) archived
proceedings, (ii) active proceedings, and (iii) suspended proceedings. This
problem&#x27;s resolution is intended to assist public and private institutions in
managing large portfolios of legal proceedings, providing gains in scale and

and machine learning techniques to solve the problem. Although working with
Portuguese NLP, which can be challenging due to lack of resources, our
approaches performed remarkably well in the classification task, achieving
maximum accuracy of .93 and top average F1 Scores of .89 (macro) and .93
(weighted). Furthermore, we could extract and interpret the patterns learned by
one of our models besides quantifying how those patterns relate to the
classification task. The interpretability step is important among machine

accurate predictions, but also outputs calibrated posterior probabilities.
However, many existing classifiers, especially deep neural network classifiers,
tend to be uncalibrated. Post-hoc calibration is a technique to recalibrate a
model by learning a calibration map. Existing approaches mostly focus on
constructing calibration maps with low calibration errors, however, this
quality is inadequate for a calibrator being useful. In this paper, we
introduce two constraints that are worth consideration in designing a
calibration map for post-hoc calibration. Then we present Meta-Cal, which is
built from a base calibrator and a ranking model. Under some mild assumptions,
two high-probability bounds are given with respect to these constraints.
Empirical results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet and a range of popular
network architectures show our proposed method significantly outperforms the
current state of the art for post-hoc multi-class classification calibration.</span>

mitigating cyber risks and proactively blocking intrusions. In this paper, we
propose MG-DVD, a novel detection framework based on dynamic heterogeneous
graph learning, to detect malware variants in real time. Particularly, MG-DVD
first models the fine-grained execution event streams of malware variants into
dynamic heterogeneous graphs and investigates real-world meta-graphs between
malware objects, which can effectively characterize more discriminative
malicious evolutionary patterns between malware and their variants. Then,
MG-DVD presents two dynamic walk-based heterogeneous graph learning methods to
learn more comprehensive representations of malware variants, which
significantly reduces the cost of the entire graph retraining. As a result,
MG-DVD is equipped with the ability to detect malware variants in real time,
and it presents better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-graphs.
Comprehensive experiments on large-scale samples prove that our proposed MG-DVD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting malware variants in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency.</span>

machine learning paradigm. As a result of statistical heterogeneity, recent
studies clearly show that the performance of popular FL methods (e.g., FedAvg)
deteriorates dramatically due to the client drift caused by local updates. This
paper proposes a novel Federated Learning algorithm (called IGFL), which
leverages both Individual and Group behaviors to mimic distribution, thereby
improving the ability to deal with heterogeneity. Unlike existing FL methods,
our IGFL can be applied to both client and server optimization. As a
by-product, we propose a new attention-based federated learning in the server
optimization of IGFL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to
incorporate attention mechanisms into federated optimization. We conduct
extensive experiments and show that IGFL can significantly improve the
performance of existing federated learning methods. Especially when the
distributions of data among individuals are diverse, IGFL can improve the
classification accuracy by about 13% compared with prior baselines.</span>

as RGB, thermal and hyperspectral cameras (among others), to make large scale
and rapid measurements of the physical properties of plants for the purpose of
better understanding the difference between crops and facilitating rapid plant
breeding programs. One of the most basic phenotyping tasks is to determine the
cultivar, or species, in a particular sensor product. This simple phenotype can
be used to detect errors in planting and to learn the most differentiating
features between cultivars. It is also a challenging visual recognition task,
as a large number of highly related crops are grown simultaneously, leading to
a classification problem with low inter-class variance. In this paper, we
introduce the Sorghum-100 dataset, a large dataset of RGB imagery of sorghum
captured by a state-of-the-art gantry system, a multi-resolution network
architecture that learns both global and fine-grained features on the crops,
and a new global pooling strategy called Dynamic Outlier Pooling which

                                        <span>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are a promising approach to
learn dynamic models from time-series data in science and engineering
applications. This work aims at learning Neural ODE for stiff systems, which
are usually raised from chemical kinetic modeling in chemical and biological
systems. We first show the challenges of learning neural ODE in the classical
stiff ODE systems of Robertson&#x27;s problem and propose techniques to mitigate the
challenges associated with scale separations in stiff systems. We then present
successful demonstrations in stiff systems of Robertson&#x27;s problem and an air
pollution problem. The demonstrations show that the usage of deep networks with
rectified activations, proper scaling of the network outputs as well as loss
functions, and stabilized gradient calculations are the key techniques enabling
the learning of stiff neural ODE. The success of learning stiff neural ODE
opens up possibilities of using neural ODEs in applications with widely varying
time-scales, like chemical dynamics in energy conversion, environmental
engineering, and the life sciences.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we study the bandits with knapsacks (BwK) problem and develop
a primal-dual based algorithm that achieves a problem-dependent logarithmic
regret bound. The BwK problem extends the multi-arm bandit (MAB) problem to
model the resource consumption associated with playing each arm, and the
existing BwK literature has been mainly focused on deriving asymptotically
optimal distribution-free regret bounds. We first study the primal and dual
linear programs underlying the BwK problem. From this primal-dual perspective,
we discover symmetry between arms and knapsacks, and then propose a new notion
of sub-optimality measure for the BwK problem. The sub-optimality measure
highlights the important role of knapsacks in determining algorithm regret and
inspires the design of our two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, the
algorithm identifies the optimal arms and the binding knapsacks, and in the
second phase, it exhausts the binding knapsacks via playing the optimal arms
through an adaptive procedure. Our regret upper bound involves the proposed
sub-optimality measure and it has a logarithmic dependence on length of horizon
$T$ and a polynomial dependence on $m$ (the numbers of arms) and $d$ (the
number of knapsacks). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
problem-dependent logarithmic regret bound for solving the general BwK problem.</span>

inference due to its computational efficiency and broad applicability. Crucial
to the performance of VI is the selection of the associated divergence measure,
as VI approximates the intractable distribution by minimizing this divergence.
In this paper we propose a meta-learning algorithm to learn the divergence
metric suited for the task of interest, automating the design of VI methods. In
addition, we learn the initialization of the variational parameters without
additional cost when our method is deployed in the few-shot learning scenarios.
We demonstrate our approach outperforms standard VI on Gaussian mixture
distribution approximation, Bayesian neural network regression, image

                                        <span>There has been a recent resurgence of interest in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) that aims to reduce the opaqueness of AI-based
decision-making systems, allowing humans to scrutinize and trust them. Prior
work in this context has focused on the attribution of responsibility for an
algorithm&#x27;s decisions to its inputs wherein responsibility is typically
approached as a purely associational concept. In this paper, we propose a
principled causality-based approach for explaining black-box decision-making
systems that addresses limitations of existing methods in XAI. At the core of
our framework lies probabilistic contrastive counterfactuals, a concept that
can be traced back to philosophical, cognitive, and social foundations of
theories on how humans generate and select explanations. We show how such
counterfactuals can quantify the direct and indirect influences of a variable
on decisions made by an algorithm, and provide actionable recourse for
individuals negatively affected by the algorithm&#x27;s decision. Unlike prior work,
our system, LEWIS: (1)can compute provably effective explanations and recourse
at local, global and contextual levels (2)is designed to work with users with
varying levels of background knowledge of the underlying causal model and
(3)makes no assumptions about the internals of an algorithmic system except for
the availability of its input-output data. We empirically evaluate LEWIS on
three real-world datasets and show that it generates human-understandable
explanations that improve upon state-of-the-art approaches in XAI, including
the popular LIME and SHAP. Experiments on synthetic data further demonstrate
the correctness of LEWIS&#x27;s explanations and the scalability of its recourse
algorithm.</span>

application areas including gene regulatory networks inference, risk analysis
and image processing. Learning the structure of a Bayesian network (BNSL) from
discrete data is known to be an NP-hard task with a superexponential search
space of directed acyclic graphs. In this work, we propose a new polynomial

generalised arc consistency algorithm for the acyclicity constraint. We embed
these in the constraint programmingbased branch-and-bound solver CPBayes and
show that, despite being suboptimal, they improve performance by orders of

state-of-the-art solver for the BNSL problem which solves an NP-hard problem to

                                        <span>We show that learning can be improved by using loss functions that evolve
cyclically during training to emphasize one class at a time. In
underparameterized networks, such dynamical loss functions can lead to
successful training for networks that fail to find a deep minima of the
standard cross-entropy loss. In overparameterized networks, dynamical loss
functions can lead to better generalization. Improvement arises from the
interplay of the changing loss landscape with the dynamics of the system as it
evolves to minimize the loss. In particular, as the loss function oscillates,
instabilities develop in the form of bifurcation cascades, which we study using
the Hessian and Neural Tangent Kernel. Valleys in the landscape widen and
deepen, and then narrow and rise as the loss landscape changes during a cycle.
As the landscape narrows, the learning rate becomes too large and the network
becomes unstable and bounces around the valley. This process ultimately pushes
the system into deeper and wider regions of the loss landscape and is
characterized by decreasing eigenvalues of the Hessian. This results in better
regularized models with improved generalization performance.</span>

foveation operations have for machine vision systems, inspired by the foveated
human visual system, which has higher acuity at the center of gaze and
texture-like encoding in the periphery. To do so, we introduce models
consisting of a first-stage \textit{fixed} image transform followed by a
second-stage \textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the
first stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage,
which we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with
spatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and
a final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1)
the foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the
reference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d.
generalization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater
sensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to
occlusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a
stronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with
a weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over
different classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics.
Altogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based
computations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format
of scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the
representational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have
for processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the
next generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.

of poor health and wellbeing. To help with their problems, we collected and
analyzed physiological and behavioral wearable sensor data from shift working
nurses and doctors, as well as their behavioral questionnaire data and their
self-reported daily health and wellbeing labels, including alertness,
happiness, energy, health, and stress. We found the similarities and

multitask and multilabel deep learning model, where we modeled physiological

participants&#x27; next day&#x27;s multidimensional self-reported health and wellbeing

learning tasks, there is little understanding behind the structures that are
being captured by these embeddings. For example, we wonder if the topological
features, such as the Triangle Count, the Degree of the node and other
centrality measures are concretely encoded in the embeddings. Furthermore, we
ask if the presence of these structures in the embeddings is necessary for a
better performance on the downstream tasks, such as clustering and
classification. To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical
study over three classes of unsupervised graph embedding models and seven
different variants of Graph Autoencoders. Our results show that five
topological features: the Degree, the Local Clustering Score, the Betweenness
Centrality, the Eigenvector Centrality, and Triangle Count are concretely
preserved in the first layer of the graph autoencoder that employs the SUM
aggregation rule, under the condition that the model preserves the second-order
proximity. We supplement further evidence for the presence of these features by
revealing a hierarchy in the distribution of the topological features in the
embeddings of the aforementioned model. We also show that a model with such
properties can outperform other models on certain downstream tasks, especially
when the preserved features are relevant to the task at hand. Finally, we
evaluate the suitability of our findings through a test case study related to
social influence prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Transfer learning has become a common solution to address training data
scarcity in practice. It trains a specified student model by reusing or
fine-tuning early layers of a well-trained teacher model that is usually
publicly available. However, besides utility improvement, the transferred
public knowledge also brings potential threats to model confidentiality, and
even further raises other security and privacy issues.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the
teacher model exposure threat in the transfer learning context, aiming to gain
a deeper insight into the tension between public knowledge and model
confidentiality. To this end, we propose a teacher model fingerprinting attack
to infer the origin of a student model, i.e., the teacher model it transfers
from. Specifically, we propose a novel optimization-based method to carefully
generate queries to probe the student model to realize our attack. Unlike
existing model reverse engineering approaches, our proposed fingerprinting
method neither relies on fine-grained model outputs, e.g., posteriors, nor
auxiliary information of the model architecture or training dataset. We
systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The empirical
results demonstrate that our attack can accurately identify the model origin
with few probing queries. Moreover, we show that the proposed attack can serve
as a stepping stone to facilitating other attacks against machine learning
models, such as model stealing.</span>

                                        <span>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) results from chronic remodeling caused by
a broad range of systemic and cardiovascular disease including hypertension,
aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis. Early
detection and characterization of LVH can significantly impact patient care but
is limited by under-recognition of hypertrophy, measurement error and
variability, and difficulty differentiating etiologies of LVH. To overcome this
challenge, we present EchoNet-LVH - a deep learning workflow that automatically
quantifies ventricular hypertrophy with precision equal to human experts and
predicts etiology of LVH. Trained on 28,201 echocardiogram videos, our model
accurately measures intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE]
1.4mm, 95% CI 1.2-1.5mm), left ventricular diameter (MAE 2.4mm, 95% CI
2.2-2.6mm), and posterior wall thickness (MAE 1.2mm, 95% CI 1.1-1.3mm) and
classifies cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve of 0.83) and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (AUC 0.98) from other etiologies of LVH. In external datasets
from independent domestic and international healthcare systems, EchoNet-LVH
accurately quantified ventricular parameters (R2 of 0.96 and 0.90 respectively)
and detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC 0.79) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(AUC 0.89) on the domestic external validation site. Leveraging measurements
across multiple heart beats, our model can more accurately identify subtle
changes in LV geometry and its causal etiologies. Compared to human experts,
EchoNet-LVH is fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise
measurements, and lays the foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac
hypertrophy. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly
available a large dataset of 23,212 annotated echocardiogram videos.</span>

underexplored problem of assessing pre-trained models for the target task and
select best ones from the model zoo \emph{without fine-tuning}. A few pilot
works addressed the problem in transferring supervised pre-trained models to
classification tasks, but they cannot handle emerging unsupervised pre-trained
models or regression tasks. In pursuit of a practical assessment method, we
propose to estimate the maximum value of label evidence given features
extracted by pre-trained models. Unlike the maximum likelihood, the maximum
evidence is \emph{immune to over-fitting}, while its expensive computation can
be dramatically reduced by our carefully designed algorithm. The Logarithm of
Maximum Evidence (LogME) can be used to assess pre-trained models for transfer
learning: a pre-trained model with a high LogME value is likely to have good
transfer performance. LogME is \emph{fast, accurate, and general},
characterizing itself as the first practical method for assessing pre-trained
models. Compared with brute-force fine-tuning, LogME brings at most
$3000\times$ speedup in wall-clock time and requires only $1\%$ memory
footprint. It outperforms prior methods by a large margin in their setting and
is applicable to new settings. It is general enough for diverse pre-trained
models (supervised pre-trained and unsupervised pre-trained), downstream tasks
(classification and regression), and modalities (vision and language). Code is

                                        <span>The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to SGD&#x27;s
mysterious ability to avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, as sharp
minima are known to lead to poor generalization. Recently, empirical evidence
of heavy-tailed gradient noise was reported in many deep learning tasks, and it
was shown in \c{S}im\c{s}ekli (2019a,b) that SGD can escape sharp local minima
under the presence of such heavy-tailed gradient noise, providing a partial
solution to the mystery. In this work, we analyze a popular variant of SGD
where gradients are truncated above a fixed threshold. We show that it achieves
a stronger notion of avoiding sharp minima: it can effectively eliminate sharp
local minima entirely from its training trajectory. We characterize the
dynamics of truncated SGD driven by heavy-tailed noises. First, we show that
the truncation threshold and width of the attraction field dictate the order of
the first exit time from the associated local minimum. Moreover, when the
objective function satisfies appropriate structural conditions, we prove that
as the learning rate decreases, the dynamics of heavy-tailed truncated SGD
closely resemble those of a continuous-time Markov chain that never visits any
sharp minima. Real data experiments on deep learning confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds a &quot;flatter&quot; local
minima and achieves better generalization.</span>

that deep learning is carried out in edge computing platforms. However, the
effectiveness of interpretability methods on these networks has not been
assessed.

In this paper, we compare the performance of several widely used saliency
map-based interpretabilty techniques (Gradient, SmoothGrad and GradCAM), when
applied to Binarized or Full Precision Neural Networks (FPNNs). We found that
the basic Gradient method produces very similar-looking maps for both types of
network. However, SmoothGrad produces significantly noisier maps for BNNs.
GradCAM also produces saliency maps which differ between network types, with
some of the BNNs having seemingly nonsensical explanations. We comment on
possible reasons for these differences in explanations and present it as an
example of why interpretability techniques should be tested on a wider range of
network types.</span>

                                        <span>Tensor Networks (TN) offer a powerful framework to efficiently represent very
high-dimensional objects. TN have recently shown their potential for machine
learning applications and offer a unifying view of common tensor decomposition
models such as Tucker, tensor train (TT) and tensor ring (TR). However,
identifying the best tensor network structure from data for a given task is
challenging. In this work, we leverage the TN formalism to develop a generic
and efficient adaptive algorithm to jointly learn the structure and the
parameters of a TN from data. Our method is based on a simple greedy approach
starting from a rank one tensor and successively identifying the most promising
tensor network edges for small rank increments. Our algorithm can adaptively
identify TN structures with small number of parameters that effectively
optimize any differentiable objective function. Experiments on tensor
decomposition, tensor completion and model compression tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In particular, our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art evolutionary topology search [Li and Sun, 2020] for tensor
decomposition of images (while being orders of magnitude faster) and finds
efficient tensor network structures to compress neural networks outperforming
popular TT based approaches [Novikov et al., 2015].</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new method for unsupervised continual knowledge consolidation in
generative models that relies on the partitioning of Variational Autoencoder&#x27;s
latent space. Acquiring knowledge about new data samples without forgetting
previous ones is a critical problem of continual learning. Currently proposed
methods achieve this goal by extending the existing model while constraining
its behavior not to degrade on the past data, which does not exploit the full
potential of relations within the entire training dataset. In this work, we
identify this limitation and posit the goal of continual learning as a
knowledge accumulation task. We solve it by continuously re-aligning latent
space partitions that we call bands which are representations of samples seen
in different tasks, driven by the similarity of the information they contain.
In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective method for controlled
forgetting of past data that improves the quality of reconstructions encoded in
latent bands and a latent space disentanglement technique that improves
knowledge consolidation. On top of the standard continual learning evaluation
benchmarks, we evaluate our method on a new knowledge consolidation scenario
and show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art by up to
twofold across all testing scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Applying artificial neural networks (ANN) to specific tasks, researchers,
programmers, and other specialists usually overshot the number of convolutional
layers in their designs. By implication, these ANNs hold too many parameters,
which needed unnecessarily trained without impacting the result. The features,
a convolutional layer can process, are strictly limited by its receptive field.
By layer-wise analyzing the expansion of the receptive fields, we can reliably
predict sequences of layers that will not contribute qualitatively to the
inference in thegiven ANN architecture. Based on these analyses, we propose
design strategies to resolve these inefficiencies, optimizing the
explainability and the computational performance of ANNs. Since neither the
strategies nor the analysis requires training of the actual model, these
insights allow for a very efficient design process of ANNs architectures which
might be automated in the future.</span>

previous approaches requiring style-labeled training data, our method makes use
of readily-available unlabeled text by relying on the implicit connection in
style between adjacent sentences, and uses labeled data only at inference time.
We adapt T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), a strong pretrained text-to-text model, to
extract a style vector from text and use it to condition the decoder to perform
style transfer. As our label-free training results in a style vector space
encoding many facets of style, we recast transfers as &quot;targeted restyling&quot;
vector operations that adjust specific attributes of the input while preserving
others. We demonstrate that training on unlabeled Amazon reviews data results
in a model that is competitive on sentiment transfer, even compared to models
trained fully on labeled data. Furthermore, applying our novel method to a
diverse corpus of unlabeled web text results in a single model capable of
transferring along multiple dimensions of style (dialect, emotiveness,
formality, politeness, sentiment) despite no additional training and using only
a handful of exemplars at inference time.</span>

Descent and Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent minimize the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to constrained target distributions by
evolving particles in a dual space defined by a mirror map. Stein Variational
Natural Gradient exploits non-Euclidean geometry to more efficiently minimize

We demonstrate that these new samplers yield accurate approximations to

                                        <span>Current popular phishing prevention techniques mainly utilize reactive
blocklists, which leave a &#x60;&#x60;window of opportunity&#x27;&#x27; for attackers during which
victims are unprotected. One possible approach to shorten this window aims to
detect phishing attacks earlier, during website preparation, by monitoring
Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Previous attempts to work with CT log data
for phishing classification exist, however they lack evaluations on actual CT
log data. In this paper, we present a pipeline that facilitates such
evaluations by addressing a number of problems when working with CT log data.
The pipeline includes dataset creation, training, and past or live
classification of CT logs. Its modular structure makes it possible to easily
exchange classifiers or verification sources to support ground truth labeling
efforts and classifier comparisons. We test the pipeline on a number of new and
existing classifiers, and find a general potential to improve classifiers for
this scenario in the future. We publish the source code of the pipeline and the
used datasets along with this paper
(https://gitlab.com/rwth-itsec/ctl-pipeline), thus making future research in
this direction more accessible.</span>

                                        <span>Cloud computing service models have experienced rapid growth and inefficient
resource usage is known as one of the greatest causes of high energy
consumption in cloud data centers. Resource allocation in cloud data centers
aiming to reduce energy consumption has been conducted using live migration of
Virtual Machines (VMs) and their consolidation into the small number of
Physical Machines (PMs). However, the selection of the appropriate VM for
migration is an important challenge. To solve this issue, VMs can be classified
according to the pattern of user requests into sensitive or insensitive classes
to latency, and thereafter suitable VMs can be selected for migration. In this
paper, the combination of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) is utilized for the classification of VMs in the Microsoft Azure
dataset. Due to the fact the majority of VMs in this dataset are labeled as
insensitive to latency, migration of more VMs in this group not only reduces
energy consumption but also decreases the violation of Service Level Agreements
(SLA). Based on the empirical results, the proposed model obtained an accuracy
of 95.18which clearly demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model
compared to other existing models.</span>

each entity to a unique embedding vector. Such a shallow lookup results in a
linear growth of memory consumption for storing the embedding matrix and incurs
high computational costs when working with real-world KGs. Drawing parallels
with subword tokenization commonly used in NLP, we explore the landscape of
more parameter-efficient node embedding strategies with possibly sublinear
memory requirements. To this end, we propose NodePiece, an anchor-based
approach to learn a fixed-size entity vocabulary. In NodePiece, a vocabulary of
subword/sub-entity units is constructed from anchor nodes in a graph with known
relation types. Given such a fixed-size vocabulary, it is possible to bootstrap
an encoding and embedding for any entity, including those unseen during
training. Experiments show that NodePiece performs competitively in node
classification, link prediction, and relation prediction tasks while retaining
less than 10% of explicit nodes in a graph as anchors and often having 10x
fewer parameters.</span>

area, we focus on the problem of designing causal estimators and controllers
which compete against a clairvoyant noncausal policy, instead of the best
policy selected in hindsight from some fixed parametric class. We show that the

present tight,data-dependent bounds on the regret incurred by our algorithms in

traditional robust estimation and control, which focuses on minimizing
worst-case cost, to minimizing worst-case regret. We propose regret-optimal

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained considerable attention
owing to their ability to reproduce images. However, they can recreate training
images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and
compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the
recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by
demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy
images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators.
However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to
decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its
application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur,
compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these
problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that
can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without
knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or
quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator
model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators.
However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we
introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a
data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to
suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression,
we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between
irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative
studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ. In addition, we
demonstrate the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration.</span>

                                        <span>Reflecting on the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in deep
reinforcement learning (RL) have been in the discrete action domain. Robotic
manipulation, however, is inherently a continuous control environment, but
these continuous control reinforcement learning algorithms often depend on
actor-critic methods that are sample-inefficient and inherently difficult to
train, due to the joint optimisation of the actor and critic. To that end, we
explore how we can bring the stability of discrete action RL algorithms to the
robot manipulation domain. We extend the recently released ARM algorithm, by
replacing the continuous next-best pose agent with a discrete next-best pose
agent. Discretisation of rotation is trivial given its bounded nature, while
translation is inherently unbounded, making discretisation difficult. We
formulate the translation prediction as the voxel prediction problem by
discretising the 3D space; however, voxelisation of a large workspace is memory
intensive and would not work with a high density of voxels, crucial to
obtaining the resolution needed for robotic manipulation. We therefore propose
to apply this voxel prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner by gradually
increasing the resolution. In each step, we extract the highest valued voxel as
the predicted location, which is then used as the centre of the
higher-resolution voxelisation in the next step. This coarse-to-fine prediction
is applied over several steps, giving a near-lossless prediction of the
translation. We show that our new coarse-to-fine algorithm is able to
accomplish RLBench tasks much more efficiently than the continuous control
equivalent, and even train some real-world tasks, tabular rasa, in less than 7
minutes, with only 3 demonstrations. Moreover, we show that by moving to a
voxel representation, we are able to easily incorporate observations from
multiple cameras.</span>

for constrained resource allocation in which $N$ independent processes are
managed. However, previous work only study the offline setting where problem
dynamics are known. We address this restrictive assumption, designing the first
algorithms for learning good policies for Multi-action RMABs online using
combinations of Lagrangian relaxation and Q-learning. Our first approach,
MAIQL, extends a method for Q-learning the Whittle index in binary-action RMABs
to the multi-action setting. We derive a generalized update rule and
convergence proof and establish that, under standard assumptions, MAIQL
converges to the asymptotically optimal multi-action RMAB policy as
$t\rightarrow{}\infty$. However, MAIQL relies on learning Q-functions and
indexes on two timescales which leads to slow convergence and requires problem
structure to perform well. Thus, we design a second algorithm, LPQL, which
learns the well-performing and more general Lagrange policy for multi-action
RMABs by learning to minimize the Lagrange bound through a variant of
Q-learning. To ensure fast convergence, we take an approximation strategy that
enables learning on a single timescale, then give a guarantee relating the
approximation&#x27;s precision to an upper bound of LPQL&#x27;s return as
$t\rightarrow{}\infty$. Finally, we show that our approaches always outperform
baselines across multiple settings, including one derived from real-world

                                        <span>The transition matrix, denoting the transition relationship from clean labels
to noisy labels, is essential to build statistically consistent classifiers in
label-noise learning. Existing methods for estimating the transition matrix
rely heavily on estimating the noisy class posterior. However, the estimation
error for noisy class posterior could be large due to the randomness of label
noise, which would lead the transition matrix to be poorly estimated.
Therefore, in this paper, we aim to solve this problem by exploiting the
divide-and-conquer paradigm. Specifically, we introduce an intermediate class
to avoid directly estimating the noisy class posterior. By this intermediate
class, the original transition matrix can then be factorized into the product
of two easy-to-estimate transition matrices. We term the proposed method the
dual-T estimator. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results illustrate
the effectiveness of the dual-T estimator for estimating transition matrices,
leading to better classification performances.</span>

(LISTA) has attracted increasing attentions. A large number of experiments as
well as some theories have proved the high efficiency of LISTA for solving
sparse coding problems. However, existing LISTA methods are all serial
connection. To address this issue, we propose a novel extragradient based LISTA
(ELISTA), which has a residual structure and theoretical guarantees. In
particular, our algorithm can also provide the interpretability for Res-Net to
a certain extent. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that our method
attains linear convergence. In practice, extensive empirical results verify the
advantages of our method.</span>

target outputs, with the goal of predicting correct outputs for unseen test
inputs. Here we demonstrate a problem of machine learning in vital application
areas such as medical informatics or patent law that consists of the inclusion
of measurements on which target outputs are deterministically defined in the
representations of input data. This leads to perfect, but circular predictions
based on a machine reconstruction of the known target definition, but fails on
real-world data where the defining measurements may not or only incompletely be
available. We present a circularity test that shows, for given datasets and
black-box machine learning models, whether the target functional definition can
be reconstructed and has been used in training. We argue that a transfer of
research results to real-world applications requires to avoid circularity by
separating measurements that define target outcomes from data representations
in machine learning.</span>

shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process,
automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been
explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep
learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the
data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning
(FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to
cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data.
However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may
cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a
simple yet effective algorithm, named \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that
shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our
approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy
and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the
COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals
to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without
sharing local patients&#x27; data.</span>

                                        <span>The increasing computational requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) have
led to significant interest in obtaining DNN models that are sparse, yet
accurate. Recent work has investigated the even harder case of sparse training,
where the DNN weights are, for as much as possible, already sparse to reduce
computational costs during training.

Existing sparse training methods are mainly empirical and often have lower
accuracy relative to the dense baseline. In this paper, we present a general
approach called Alternating Compressed/DeCompressed (AC/DC) training of DNNs,
demonstrate convergence for a variant of the algorithm, and show that AC/DC
outperforms existing sparse training methods in accuracy at similar
computational budgets; at high sparsity levels, AC/DC even outperforms existing
methods that rely on accurate pre-trained dense models. An important property
of AC/DC is that it allows co-training of dense and sparse models, yielding
accurate sparse-dense model pairs at the end of the training process. This is
useful in practice, where compressed variants may be desirable for deployment
in resource-constrained settings without re-doing the entire training flow, and
also provides us with insights into the accuracy gap between dense and
compressed models.</span>

differential equations (PDEs) is computationally expensive and various
multiscale methods have been developed for addressing such problems. In
addition, it is challenging to develop accurate surrogate and uncertainty
quantification models for high-dimensional problems governed by stochastic
multiscale PDEs using limited training data. In this work to address these
challenges, we introduce a novel hybrid deep-learning and multiscale approach
for stochastic multiscale PDEs with limited training data. For demonstration
purposes, we focus on a porous media flow problem. We use an image-to-image
supervised deep learning model to learn the mapping between the input
permeability field and the multiscale basis functions. We introduce a Bayesian
approach to this hybrid framework to allow us to perform uncertainty
quantification and propagation tasks. The performance of this hybrid approach
is evaluated with varying intrinsic dimensionality of the permeability field.
Numerical results indicate that the hybrid network can efficiently predict well
for high-dimensional inputs.</span>

deep learning models in an open-world setting. However, existing OOD detection
solutions can be brittle in the open world, facing various types of adversarial
OOD inputs. While methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data have emerged, our
analysis on illuminative examples reveals a key insight that the majority of
auxiliary OOD examples may not meaningfully improve or even hurt the decision
boundary of the OOD detector, which is also observed in empirical results on
real data. In this paper, we provide a theoretically motivated method,
Adversarial Training with informative Outlier Mining (ATOM), which improves the
robustness of OOD detection. We show that, by mining informative auxiliary OOD
data, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance, and somewhat
surprisingly, generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance under a broad family of classic and adversarial
OOD evaluation tasks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 in-distribution dataset,
ATOM reduces the FPR (at TPR 95%) by up to 57.99% under adversarial OOD inputs,
surpassing the previous best baseline by a large margin.</span>

interpretability of connectionist architectures, have been reported in the
recent literature. However, our understanding of how to design Bayesian Deep
Learning (BDL) hyperparameters, specifically, the depth, width and ensemble
size, for robust function mapping with uncertainty quantification, is still
emerging. This paper attempts to further our understanding by mapping Bayesian
connectionist representations to polynomials of different orders with varying
noise types and ratios. We examine the noise-contaminated polynomials to search
for the combination of hyperparameters that can extract the underlying
polynomial signals while quantifying uncertainties based on the noise
attributes. Specifically, we attempt to study the question that an appropriate
neural architecture and ensemble configuration can be found to detect a signal
of any n-th order polynomial contaminated with noise having different
distributions and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios and varying noise attributes.
Our results suggest the possible existence of an optimal network depth as well
as an optimal number of ensembles for prediction skills and uncertainty
quantification, respectively. However, optimality is not discernible for width,
even though the performance gain reduces with increasing width at high values
of width. Our experiments and insights can be directional to understand
theoretical properties of BDL representations and to design practical
solutions.</span>

adults which has been on a constant rise. Elderly people have several needs and
requirements due to physical disabilities, cognitive issues, weakened memory
and disorganized behavior, that they face with increasing age. The extent of
these limitations also differs according to the varying diversities in elderly,
which include age, gender, background, experience, skills, knowledge and so on.
These varying needs and challenges with increasing age, limits abilities of
older adults to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in an independent
manner. To add to it, the shortage of caregivers creates a looming need for
technology-based services for elderly people, to assist them in performing
their daily routine tasks to sustain their independent living and active aging.
To address these needs, this work consists of making three major contributions
in this field. First, it provides a rather comprehensive review of assisted
living technologies aimed at helping elderly people to perform ADLs. Second,
the work discusses the challenges identified through this review, that
currently exist in the context of implementation of assisted living services
for elderly care in Smart Homes and Smart Cities. Finally, the work also
outlines an approach for implementation, extension and integration of the
existing works in this field for development of a much-needed framework that
can provide personalized assistance and user-centered behavior interventions to
elderly as per their varying and ever-changing needs.</span>

                                        <span>End-to-end models with auto-regressive decoders have shown impressive results
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models formulate the
sequence-level probability as a product of the conditional probabilities of all
individual tokens given their histories. However, the performance of locally
normalised models can be sub-optimal because of factors such as exposure bias.
Consequently, the model distribution differs from the underlying data
distribution. In this paper, the residual energy-based model (R-EBM) is
proposed to complement the auto-regressive ASR model to close the gap between
the two distributions. Meanwhile, R-EBMs can also be regarded as
utterance-level confidence estimators, which may benefit many downstream tasks.
Experiments on a 100hr LibriSpeech dataset show that R-EBMs can reduce the word
error rates (WERs) by 8.2%/6.7% while improving areas under precision-recall
curves of confidence scores by 12.6%/28.4% on test-clean/test-other sets.
Furthermore, on a state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning
(wav2vec 2.0), R-EBMs still significantly improves both the WER and confidence
estimation performance.</span>

                                        <span>We study data clustering problems with $\ell_p$-norm objectives (e.g.
$k$-Median and $k$-Means) in the context of individual fairness. The dataset
consists of $n$ points, and we want to find $k$ centers such that (a) the
objective is minimized, while (b) respecting the individual fairness constraint
that every point $v$ has a center within a distance at most $r(v)$, where
$r(v)$ is $v$&#x27;s distance to its $(n/k)$th nearest point. Jung, Kannan, and Lutz
[FORC 2020] introduced this concept and designed a clustering algorithm with
provable (approximate) fairness and objective guarantees for the $\ell_\infty$
or $k$-Center objective. Mahabadi and Vakilian [ICML 2020] revisited this
problem to give a local-search algorithm for all $\ell_p$-norms. Empirically,
their algorithms outperform Jung et. al.&#x27;s by a large margin in terms of cost
(for $k$-Median and $k$-Means), but they incur a reasonable loss in fairness.
In this paper, our main contribution is to use Linear Programming (LP)
techniques to obtain better algorithms for this problem, both in theory and in
practice. We prove that by modifying known LP rounding techniques, one gets a
worst-case guarantee on the objective which is much better than in MV20, and
empirically, this objective is extremely close to the optimal. Furthermore, our
theoretical fairness guarantees are comparable with MV20 in theory, and
empirically, we obtain noticeably fairer solutions. Although solving the LP
{\em exactly} might be prohibitive, we demonstrate that in practice, a simple
sparsification technique drastically improves the run-time of our algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of compressed sensing is to estimate a high dimensional vector from
an underdetermined system of noisy linear equations. In analogy to classical
compressed sensing, here we assume a generative model as a prior, that is, we
assume the vector is represented by a deep generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Classical recovery approaches such as empirical risk
minimization (ERM) are guaranteed to succeed when the measurement matrix is
sub-Gaussian. However, when the measurement matrix and measurements are
heavy-tailed or have outliers, recovery may fail dramatically. In this paper we
propose an algorithm inspired by the Median-of-Means (MOM). Our algorithm
guarantees recovery for heavy-tailed data, even in the presence of outliers.
Theoretically, our results show our novel MOM-based algorithm enjoys the same
sample complexity guarantees as ERM under sub-Gaussian assumptions. Our
experiments validate both aspects of our claims: other algorithms are indeed
fragile and fail under heavy-tailed and/or corrupted data, while our approach
exhibits the predicted robustness.</span>

differential privacy is an integral component of various private data analysis
tasks. In this paper, we present the oneshot Laplace mechanism, which
generalizes the well-known Report Noisy Max mechanism to reporting noisy
top-$k$ elements. We show that the oneshot Laplace mechanism with a noise level
of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\eps)$ is approximately differentially private.
Compared to the previous peeling approach of running Report Noisy Max $k$
times, the oneshot Laplace mechanism only adds noises and computes the top $k$
elements once, hence much more efficient for large $k$. In addition, our proof
of privacy relies on a novel coupling technique that bypasses the use of
composition theorems. Finally, we present a novel application of efficient
top-$k$ selection in the classical problem of ranking from pairwise

classification models, tagged by the community with the broader term supervised
learning. The extraordinary results gave rise to a hype loaded with ambitious
promises and overstatements. Soon the community realised that the success owed
much to the availability of thousands of labelled examples and supervised
learning went, for many, from glory to shame: Some criticised deep learning as
a whole and others proclaimed that the way forward had to be alternatives to
supervised learning: predictive, unsupervised, semi-supervised and, more
recently, self-supervised learning. However, all these seem brand names, rather
than actual categories of a theoretically grounded taxonomy. Moreover, the call
to banish supervised learning was motivated by the questionable claim that
humans learn with little or no supervision and are capable of robust
out-of-distribution generalisation. Here, we review insights about learning and
supervision in nature, revisit the notion that learning and generalisation are
not possible without supervision or inductive biases and argue that we will
make better progress if we just call it by its name.</span>

separate basis functions, as occurs with kernel Ridge regression. We
demonstrate quantitative procedures to determine the very structure of the

                                        <span>This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative
procedures, such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions
from the standard classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group
fairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected
groups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry
historical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground
truth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a
single group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or
further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in
them is an impossible dilemma and being &#x60;&#x60;fair&#x27;&#x27; with respect to Asians may
require being &#x60;&#x60;unfair&#x27;&#x27; with respect to South Asians. This motivates the
introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the
relevant groupings.

We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their
incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of
demographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible}
to achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we
introduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously
through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results
and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models.</span>

computing has had a huge impact on the software development life cycle and
DevOps processes. Particularly, incident management has become critical for
developing and operating large-scale services. Prior work on incident
management has heavily focused on the challenges with incident triaging and
de-duplication. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of structured
knowledge extraction from service incidents. We have built SoftNER, a framework
for mining Knowledge Graphs from incident reports. First, we build a novel
multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF model which leverages not just the
semantic context but also the data-types for extracting factual information in
the form of named entities. Next, we present an approach to mine relations
between the named entities for automatically constructing knowledge graphs. We
have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud service provider and have
evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud incidents. We show that the
unsupervised machine learning pipeline has a high precision of 0.96. Our
multi-task learning based deep learning model also outperforms the
state-of-the-art NER models. Lastly, using the knowledge extracted by SoftNER,
we are able to build accurate models for applications such as incident triaging
and recommending entities based on their relevance to incident titles.</span>

(nimblephysics.org), that supports Lagrangian dynamics and hard contact
constraints for articulated rigid body simulation. Our differentiable physics
engine offers a complete set of features that are typically only available in
non-differentiable physics simulators commonly used by robotics applications.
We solve contact constraints precisely using linear complementarity problems
(LCPs). We present efficient and novel analytical gradients through the LCP
formulation of inelastic contact that exploit the sparsity of the LCP solution.
We support complex contact geometry, and gradients approximating
continuous-time elastic collision. We also introduce a novel method to compute
complementarity-aware gradients that help downstream optimization tasks avoid
stalling in saddle points. We show that an implementation of this combination
in an existing physics engine (DART) is capable of a 87x single-core speedup
over finite-differencing in computing analytical Jacobians for a single

using high-resolution continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) or phasor measurements.
Both the anomaly and anomaly-free measurement models are assumed to have
unknown temporal dependencies and probability distributions. Historical
training samples are assumed for the anomaly-free model, while no training
samples are available for the anomaly measurements. By transforming the
anomaly-free observations into uniform independent and identically distributed
sequences via a generative adversarial network, the proposed approach deploys a
uniformity test for anomaly detection at the sensor level. A distributed
detection scheme that combines sensor level detections at the control center is
also proposed that combines local detections to form more reliable detections.
Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
solutions for various bad-data cases using real and synthetic CPOW and PMU data
sets.</span>

more high-stakes, tools for explaining model predictions have become
increasingly important. Despite the widespread use of explainability
techniques, evaluating and comparing different feature attribution methods
remains challenging: evaluations ideally require human studies, and empirical
evaluation metrics are often computationally prohibitive on real-world
datasets. In this work, we address this issue by releasing XAI-Bench: a suite
of synthetic datasets along with a library for benchmarking feature attribution
algorithms. Unlike real-world datasets, synthetic datasets allow the efficient
computation of conditional expected values that are needed to evaluate
ground-truth Shapley values and other metrics. The synthetic datasets we
release offer a wide variety of parameters that can be configured to simulate
real-world data. We demonstrate the power of our library by benchmarking
popular explainability techniques across several evaluation metrics and
identifying failure modes for popular explainers. The efficiency of our library
will help bring new explainability methods from development to deployment.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, visual Transformer (ViT) and its following works abandon the
convolution and exploit the self-attention operation, attaining a comparable or
even higher accuracy than CNNs. More recently, MLP-Mixer abandons both the
convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture
containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises
an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves
promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset. But it
cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when
training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet21K. The
performance drop of MLP-Mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We
discover that the token-mixing MLP is a variant of the depthwise convolution
with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. But the
global reception field and the spatial-specific property make token-mixing MLP
prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture,
spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP). Different from MLP-Mixer, our S$^2$-MLP only
contains channel-mixing MLP. We utilize a spatial-shift operation for
communications between patches. It has a local reception field and is
spatial-agnostic. It is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The
proposed S$^2$-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-Mixer when
training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S$^2$-MLP accomplishes as excellent
performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler
architecture and fewer FLOPs and parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are behind many of the recent successes in machine
learning applications. However, these models can produce overconfident
decisions while encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples or making a
wrong prediction. This inconsistent predictive confidence limits the
integration of independently-trained learning models into a larger system. This
paper introduces separable concept learning framework to realistically measure
the performance of classifiers in presence of OOD examples. In this setup,
several instances of a classifier are trained on different parts of a partition
of the set of classes. Later, the performance of the combination of these
models is evaluated on a separate test set. Unlike current OOD detection
techniques, this framework does not require auxiliary OOD datasets and does not
separate classification from detection performance. Furthermore, we present a
new strong baseline for more consistent predictive confidence in deep models,
called fitted ensembles, where overconfident predictions are rectified by
transformed versions of the original classification task. Fitted ensembles can
naturally detect OOD examples without requiring auxiliary data by observing
contradicting predictions among its components. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet show fitted ensemble significantly outperform
conventional ensembles on OOD examples and are possible to scale.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal VAEs seek to model the joint distribution over heterogeneous data
(e.g.\ vision, language), whilst also capturing a shared representation across
such modalities. Prior work has typically combined information from the
modalities by reconciling idiosyncratic representations directly in the
recognition model through explicit products, mixtures, or other such
factorisations. Here we introduce a novel alternative, the MEME, that avoids
such explicit combinations by repurposing semi-supervised VAEs to combine
information between modalities implicitly through mutual supervision. This
formulation naturally allows learning from partially-observed data where some
modalities can be entirely missing -- something that most existing approaches
either cannot handle, or do so to a limited extent. We demonstrate that MEME
outperforms baselines on standard metrics across both partial and complete
observation schemes on the MNIST-SVHN (image--image) and CUB (image--text)
datasets. We also contrast the quality of the representations learnt by mutual
supervision against standard approaches and observe interesting trends in its
ability to capture relatedness between data.</span>

kinetic equations via neural networks. More precisely, we formulate the

represent the physical conservation laws. The constraints are relaxed toward
the residual loss function by the Lagrangian duality. By imposing physical
conservation properties of the solution as constraints of the learning problem,
we demonstrate far more accurate approximations of the solutions in terms of

researchers increasingly resort to machine learning to aid original scientific
discovery. Given large amounts of observational data about a system, can we
uncover the rules that govern its evolution? Solving this task holds the great
promise of fully understanding the causal interactions and being able to make
reliable predictions about the system&#x27;s behavior under interventions. We take a
step towards answering this question for time-series data generated from
systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While the governing ODEs
might not be identifiable from data alone, we show that combining simple
regularization schemes with flexible neural ODEs can robustly recover the
dynamics and causal structures from time-series data. Our results on a variety
of (non)-linear first and second order systems as well as real data validate
our method. We conclude by showing that we can also make accurate predictions
under interventions on variables or the system itself.</span>

diabetic patients. DR is a microvascular disease that affects the eye retina,
which causes vessel blockage and therefore cuts the main source of nutrition
for the retina tissues. Treatment for this visual disorder is most effective
when it is detected in its earliest stages, as severe DR can result in
irreversible blindness. Nonetheless, DR identification requires the expertise
of Ophthalmologists which is often expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,
automatic detection systems were introduced aiming to facilitate the
identification process, making it available globally in a time and
cost-efficient manner. However, due to the limited reliable datasets and
medical records for this particular eye disease, the obtained predictions
accuracies were relatively unsatisfying for eye specialists to rely on them as
diagnostic systems. Thus, we explored an ensemble-based learning strategy,
merging a substantial selection of well-known classification algorithms in one
sophisticated diagnostic model. The proposed framework achieved the highest
accuracy rates among all other common classification algorithms in the area. 4
subdatasets were generated to contain the top 5 and top 10 features of the

is an important process. The understanding of its relationship with other
variables can lead to endless benefits, particularly for the world&#x27;s monsoon
regions dependent on rainfall as a support for livelihood. Various factors play
a crucial role in the formation of rainfall, and those physical processes are
leading to significant biases in the operational weather forecasts. We use the
UNET architecture of a deep convolutional neural network with residual learning
as a proof of concept to learn global data-driven models of precipitation. The
models are trained on reanalysis datasets projected on the cubed-sphere
projection to minimize errors due to spherical distortion. The results are
compared with the operational dynamical model used by the India Meteorological
Department. The theoretical deep learning-based model shows doubling of the
grid point, as well as area averaged skill measured in Pearson correlation
coefficients relative to operational system. This study is a proof-of-concept
showing that residual learning-based UNET can unravel physical relationships to
target precipitation, and those physical constraints can be used in the
dynamical operational models towards improved precipitation forecasts. Our

nodes, a phenomenon that is only partially alleviated by backfill scheduling
methods that promote small jobs to run before large jobs. Here we describe how
to realize a novel use for these otherwise wasted resources, namely, deep
neural network (DNN) training. This important workload is easily organized as
many small fragments that can be configured dynamically to fit essentially any
node*time hole in a supercomputer&#x27;s schedule. We describe how the task of
rescaling suitable DNN training tasks to fit dynamically changing holes can be
formulated as a deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based
resource allocation algorithm, and show that this MILP problem can be solved
efficiently at run time. We show further how this MILP problem can be adapted
to optimize for administrator- or user-defined metrics. We validate our method
with supercomputer scheduler logs and different DNN training scenarios, and
demonstrate efficiencies of up to 93% compared with running the same training
tasks on dedicated nodes. Our method thus enables substantial supercomputer
resources to be allocated to DNN training with no impact on other applications.</span>

potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep
learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while
the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative
tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label
selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for
generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this
work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with
continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image
synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an
uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images
with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is
achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our
framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis
problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from
different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify
our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show
that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved
the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training
UDA methods.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) is a recently explored
learning framework, where the goal is to address the challenge of labeled data
scarcity in a target domain via transferring knowledge from multiple source
domains with annotated data. Since the source data is distributed, the privacy
of source domains&#x27; data can be a natural concern. We benefit from the idea of
domain alignment in an embedding space to address the privacy concern for MUDA.
Our method is based on aligning the sources and target distributions indirectly
via internally learned distributions, without communicating data samples
between domains. We justify our approach theoretically and perform extensive
experiments to demonstrate that our method is effective and compares favorably
against existing methods.</span>

establish a connection to their command and control (C2) server. Counteracting
DGAs, several machine learning classifiers have been proposed enabling the
identification of the DGA that generated a specific domain name and thus
triggering targeted remediation measures. However, the proposed
state-of-the-art classifiers are based on deep learning models. The black box
nature of these makes it difficult to evaluate their reasoning. The resulting
lack of confidence makes the utilization of such models impracticable. In this
paper, we propose EXPLAIN, a feature-based and contextless DGA multiclass
classifier. We comparatively evaluate several combinations of feature sets and
hyperparameters for our approach against several state-of-the-art classifiers
in a unified setting on the same real-world data. Our classifier achieves
competitive results, is real-time capable, and its predictions are easier to
trace back to features than the predictions made by the DGA multiclass
classifiers proposed in related work.</span>

                                        <span>Many machine learning techniques incorporate identity-preserving
transformations into their models to generalize their performance to previously
unseen data. These transformations are typically selected from a set of
functions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied
(e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many
natural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through
examination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these
natural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold.
Several techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie
group operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However
theses approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when
training their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of
the manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address
these limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require
transformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions
where each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of
inputs. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST highlight our model&#x27;s ability to
learn identity-preserving transformations on multi-class datasets.
Additionally, we train on CelebA to showcase our model&#x27;s ability to learn
semantically meaningful transformations on complex datasets in an unsupervised
manner.</span>

synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on
absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as,
e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces
of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that
causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the
network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural
changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the
hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of
StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they
are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our
results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and

representation learning with graph data. It follows the previous methods that
generate two views of an input graph through data augmentation. However, unlike
contrastive methods that focus on instance-level discrimination, we optimize an
innovative feature-level objective inspired by classical Canonical Correlation
Analysis. Compared with other works, our approach requires none of the
parameterized mutual information estimator, additional projector, asymmetric
structures, and most importantly, negative samples which can be costly. We show
that the new objective essentially 1) aims at discarding augmentation-variant
information by learning invariant representations, and 2) can prevent
degenerated solutions by decorrelating features in different dimensions. Our
theoretical analysis further provides an understanding for the new objective
which can be equivalently seen as an instantiation of the Information
Bottleneck Principle under the self-supervised setting. Despite its simplicity,
our method performs competitively on seven public graph datasets.</span>

Motivated by the universal consistency, we conduct a series of experiments to

tasks at the same time. When it comes to Neural Networks, that is not the case,
the major breakthroughs in the field are extremely task and domain specific.
Vision and language are dealt with in separate manners, using separate methods

benchmark Vision Models which are trained on ImageNet to help a much smaller

contained in the IMDB dataset to gray scale images. An analysis of different

contribution of this work is a novel approach which links large pretrained

different sub-fields from the original task. Without needing high compute

                                        <span>Shapley values has established itself as one of the most appropriate and
theoretically sound frameworks for explaining predictions from complex machine
learning models. The popularity of Shapley values in the explanation setting is
probably due to its unique theoretical properties. The main drawback with
Shapley values, however, is that its computational complexity grows
exponentially in the number of input features, making it unfeasible in many
real world situations where there could be hundreds or thousands of features.
Furthermore, with many (dependent) features, presenting/visualizing and
interpreting the computed Shapley values also becomes challenging. The present
paper introduces groupShapley: a conceptually simple approach for dealing with
the aforementioned bottlenecks. The idea is to group the features, for example
by type or dependence, and then compute and present Shapley values for these
groups instead of for all individual features. Reducing hundreds or thousands
of features to half a dozen or so, makes precise computations practically
feasible and the presentation and knowledge extraction greatly simplified. We
prove that under certain conditions, groupShapley is equivalent to summing the
feature-wise Shapley values within each feature group. Moreover, we provide a
simulation study exemplifying the differences when these conditions are not
met. We illustrate the usability of the approach in a real world car insurance
example, where groupShapley is used to provide simple and intuitive
explanations.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is
usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at
the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy
issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for
segmentation, and propose to adapt an &#x60;&#x60;off-the-shelf&quot; segmentation model
pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive
batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the
domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are
gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the
consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and
shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The
transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to
balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free
UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,
self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our
framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our
source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for
the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the
cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods
with the source data.</span>

                                        <span>We study pure exploration in bandits, where the dimension of the feature
representation can be much larger than the number of arms. To overcome the
curse of dimensionality, we propose to adaptively embed the feature
representation of each arm into a lower-dimensional space and carefully deal
with the induced model misspecifications. Our approach is conceptually very
different from existing works that can either only handle low-dimensional
linear bandits or passively deal with model misspecifications. We showcase the
application of our approach to two pure exploration settings that were
previously under-studied: (1) the reward function belongs to a possibly
infinite-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, and (2) the reward
function is nonlinear and can be approximated by neural networks. Our main
results provide sample complexity guarantees that only depend on the effective
dimension of the feature spaces in the kernel or neural representations.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.</span>

                                        <span>Intelligent systems are transforming the world, as well as our healthcare
system. We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that
can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such
as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory
tract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we
collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician&#x27;s diagnosis.
The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting
trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or
pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),
reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by
the physicians&#x27; diagnosis. In order to classify subject&#x27;s respiratory pathology
condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The
resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory
pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate
among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of
pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider
the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to
have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is
above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing
pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the
fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy
the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC
features.</span>

learning (RL), in this paper we propose a novel uncertainty-aware model-based
RL (UA-MBRL) framework, and then implement and validate it in autonomous
driving under various task scenarios. First, an action-conditioned ensemble
model with the ability of uncertainty assessment is established as the virtual
environment model. Then, a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL framework is
developed based on the adaptive truncation approach, providing virtual
interactions between the agent and environment model, and improving RL&#x27;s
training efficiency and performance. The developed algorithms are then
implemented in end-to-end autonomous vehicle control tasks, validated and
compared with state-of-the-art methods under various driving scenarios. The
validation results suggest that the proposed UA-MBRL method surpasses the
existing model-based and model-free RL approaches, in terms of learning
efficiency and achieved performance. The results also demonstrate the good
ability of the proposed method with respect to the adaptiveness and robustness,
under various autonomous driving scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Frequently, population studies feature pyramidally-organized data represented
using Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBM) enriched with plates. These models can
become prohibitively large in settings such as neuroimaging, where a sample is
composed of a functional MRI signal measured on 64 thousand brain locations,
across 4 measurement sessions, and at least tens of subjects. Even a reduced
example on a specific cortical region of 300 brain locations features around 1
million parameters, hampering the usage of modern density estimation techniques
such as Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). To infer parameter posterior
distributions in this challenging class of problems, we designed a novel
methodology that automatically produces a variational family dual to a target
HBM. This variatonal family, represented as a neural network, consists in the
combination of an attention-based hierarchical encoder feeding summary
statistics to a set of normalizing flows. Our automatically-derived neural
network exploits exchangeability in the plate-enriched HBM and factorizes its
parameter space. The resulting architecture reduces by orders of magnitude its
parameterization with respect to that of a typical SBI representation, while
maintaining expressivity. Our method performs inference on the specified HBM in
an amortized setup: once trained, it can readily be applied to a new data
sample to compute the parameters&#x27; full posterior. We demonstrate the capability
of our method on simulated data, as well as a challenging high-dimensional
brain parcellation experiment. We also open up several questions that lie at
the intersection between SBI techniques and structured Variational Inference.</span>

common acquisition functions are only meant for one-sample acquisition rounds
at a time, and when their scores are used naively for batch acquisition, they
result in batches lacking diversity, which deteriorates performance. On the
other hand, state-of-the-art batch acquisition functions are costly to compute.
In this paper, we present a novel class of stochastic acquisition functions
that extend one-sample acquisition functions to the batch setting by observing
how one-sample acquisition scores change as additional samples are acquired and
modelling this difference for additional batch samples. We simply acquire new
samples by sampling from the pool set using a Gibbs distribution based on the
acquisition scores. Our acquisition functions are both vastly cheaper to
compute and out-perform other batch acquisition functions.</span>

of nonlinear functions. An important and fundamental problem is to understand
the learnability of a network model through its statistical risk, or the
expected prediction error on future data. To the best of our knowledge, the
rate of convergence of neural networks shown by existing works is bounded by at
most the order of $n^{-1/4}$ for a sample size of $n$. In this paper, we show
that a class of variation-constrained neural networks, with arbitrary width,
can achieve near-parametric rate $n^{-1/2+\delta}$ for an arbitrarily small
positive constant $\delta$. It is equivalent to $n^{-1 +2\delta}$ under the
mean squared error. This rate is also observed by numerical experiments. The
result indicates that the neural function space needed for approximating smooth
functions may not be as large as what is often perceived. Our result also
provides insight to the phenomena that deep neural networks do not easily
suffer from overfitting when the number of neurons and learning parameters
rapidly grow with $n$ or even surpass $n$. We also discuss the rate of
convergence regarding other network parameters, including the input dimension,
network layer, and coefficient norm.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian processes are one of the dominant approaches in Bayesian learning.
Although the approach has been applied to numerous problems with great success,
it has a few fundamental limitations. Multiple methods in literature have
addressed these limitations. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey
of the topics as of yet. Most existing surveys focus on only one particular
variant of Gaussian processes and their derivatives. This survey details the
core motivations for using Gaussian processes, their mathematical formulations,
limitations, and research themes that have flourished over the years to address
said limitations. Furthermore, one particular research area is Deep Gaussian
Processes (DGPs), it has improved substantially in the past decade. The
significant publications that advanced the forefront of this research area are
outlined in their survey. Finally, a brief discussion on open problems and
research directions for future work is presented at the end.</span>

domain, with scarce labeled data from the target domain. We develop estimators
that achieve minimax linear risk for linear regression problems under
distribution shift. Our algorithms cover different transfer learning settings
including covariate shift and model shift. We also consider when data are
generated from either linear or general nonlinear models. We show that linear
minimax estimators are within an absolute constant of the minimax risk even

                                        <span>Intelligent systems are transforming the world, as well as our healthcare
system. We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that
can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such
as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory
tract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we
collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician&#x27;s diagnosis.
The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting
trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or
pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),
reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by
the physicians&#x27; diagnosis. In order to classify subject&#x27;s respiratory pathology
condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The
resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory
pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate
among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of
pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider
the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to
have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is
above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing
pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the
fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy
the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC
features.</span>

                                        <span>We consider repair tasks: given a critic (e.g., compiler) that assesses the
quality of an input, the goal is to train a fixer that converts a bad example
(e.g., code with syntax errors) into a good one (e.g., code with no syntax
errors). Existing works create training data consisting of (bad, good) pairs by
corrupting good examples using heuristics (e.g., dropping tokens). However,
fixers trained on this synthetically-generated data do not extrapolate well to
the real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new
training approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key ideas: (i) we use
the critic to check a fixer&#x27;s output on real bad inputs and add good (fixed)
outputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate realistic
bad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the
breaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired
data. We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new
dataset we introduce where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse
errors; and DeepFix, where the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors.
BIFI outperforms existing methods, obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on
GitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%). Notably, BIFI does not
require any labeled data; we hope it will be a strong starting point for
unsupervised learning of various repair tasks.</span>

models to perform subject-verb agreement given difficult contexts. To elucidate
the mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior, this study applies
causal mediation analysis to pre-trained neural language models. We investigate
the magnitude of models&#x27; preferences for grammatical inflections, as well as
whether neurons process subject-verb agreement similarly across sentences with
different syntactic structures. We uncover similarities and differences across
architectures and model sizes -- notably, that larger models do not necessarily
learn stronger preferences. We also observe two distinct mechanisms for
producing subject-verb agreement depending on the syntactic structure of the
input sentence. Finally, we find that language models rely on similar sets of
neurons when given sentences with similar syntactic structure.</span>

field. ProphetNet is a pre-training based natural language generation method
which shows powerful performance on English text summarization and question
generation tasks. In this paper, we extend ProphetNet into other domains and
languages, and present the ProphetNet family pre-training models, named
ProphetNet-X, where X can be English, Chinese, Multi-lingual, and so on. We
pre-train a cross-lingual generation model ProphetNet-Multi, a Chinese
generation model ProphetNet-Zh, two open-domain dialog generation models
ProphetNet-Dialog-En and ProphetNet-Dialog-Zh. And also, we provide a PLG
(Programming Language Generation) model ProphetNet-Code to show the generation
performance besides NLG (Natural Language Generation) tasks. In our
experiments, ProphetNet-X models achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 10
benchmarks. All the models of ProphetNet-X share the same model structure,
which allows users to easily switch between different models. We make the code

models and finetuning scripts.</span>

transformer architecture for our MultiST model, so that the data from different
modalities (i.e., speech and text) and different tasks (i.e., Speech
Recognition, Machine Translation, and Speech Translation) can be exploited to
enhance the model&#x27;s ability. Specifically, speech and text inputs are firstly
fed to different feature extractors to extract acoustic and textual features,
respectively. Then, these features are processed by a shared encoder--decoder
architecture. We apply several training techniques to improve the performance,
including multi-task learning, task-level curriculum learning, data
augmentation, etc. Our final system achieves significantly better results than
bilingual baselines on supervised language pairs and yields reasonable results
on zero-shot language pairs.</span>

whether, in principle, a system can ever &#x60;&#x60;understand&#x27;&#x27; raw text without access
to some form of grounding. We formally investigate the abilities of ungrounded
systems to acquire meaning. Our analysis focuses on the role of &#x60;&#x60;assertions&#x27;&#x27;:
textual contexts that provide indirect clues about the underlying semantics. We
study whether assertions enable a system to emulate representations preserving
semantic relations like equivalence. We find that assertions enable semantic
emulation of languages that satisfy a strong notion of semantic transparency.
However, for classes of languages where the same expression can take different
values in different contexts, we show that emulation can become uncomputable.
Finally, we discuss differences between our formal model and natural language,
exploring how our results generalize to a modal setting and other semantic
relations. Together, our results suggest that assertions in code or language do
not provide sufficient signal to fully emulate semantic representations. We
formalize ways in which ungrounded language models appear to be fundamentally
limited in their ability to &#x60;&#x60;understand&#x27;&#x27;.</span>

                                        <span>Most previous studies integrate cognitive language processing signals (e.g.,
eye-tracking or EEG data) into neural models of natural language processing
(NLP) just by directly concatenating word embeddings with cognitive features,
ignoring the gap between the two modalities (i.e., textual vs. cognitive) and
noise in cognitive features. In this paper, we propose a CogAlign approach to
these issues, which learns to align textual neural representations to cognitive
features. In CogAlign, we use a shared encoder equipped with a modality
discriminator to alternatively encode textual and cognitive inputs to capture
their differences and commonalities. Additionally, a text-aware attention
mechanism is proposed to detect task-related information and to avoid using
noise in cognitive features. Experimental results on three NLP tasks, namely
named entity recognition, sentiment analysis and relation extraction, show that
CogAlign achieves significant improvements with multiple cognitive features
over state-of-the-art models on public datasets. Moreover, our model is able to
transfer cognitive information to other datasets that do not have any cognitive
processing signals.</span>

question in computational social science. Traditional methods and datasets for
sentiment analysis are, however, not suitable for the domain of political text
as they do not consider the direction of sentiments expressed between entities.
In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task of identifying directed sentiment
relationship between political entities from a given news document, which we
call directed sentiment extraction. From a million-scale news corpus, we
construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political
entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for
utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting
multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate
the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by
analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two
major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. The newly proposed
problem, data, and method will facilitate future studies on interdisciplinary
NLP methods and applications.</span>

trained directly on corpora crawled from websites. They mainly focus on
improving the model architecture to produce better responses but pay little
attention to considering the quality of the training data contrastively. In
this paper, we propose a multi-level contrastive learning paradigm to model the
fine-grained quality of the responses with respect to the query. A Rank-aware
Calibration (RC) network is designed to construct the multi-level contrastive
optimization objectives. Since these objectives are calculated based on the
sentence level, which may erroneously encourage/suppress the generation of
uninformative/informative words. To tackle this incidental issue, on one hand,
we design an exquisite token-level strategy for estimating the instance loss
more accurately. On the other hand, we build a Knowledge Inference (KI)
component to capture the keyword knowledge from the reference during training
and exploit such information to encourage the generation of informative words.
We evaluate the proposed model on a carefully annotated dialogue dataset and
the results suggest that our model can generate more relevant and diverse
responses compared to the baseline models.</span>

                                        <span>Current task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems mostly manage structured knowledge
(e.g. databases and tables) to guide the goal-oriented conversations. However,
they fall short of handling dialogs which also involve unstructured knowledge
(e.g. reviews and documents). In this paper, we formulate a task of modeling
TOD grounded on a fusion of structured and unstructured knowledge. To address
this task, we propose a TOD system with semi-structured knowledge management,
SeKnow, which extends the belief state to manage knowledge with both structured
and unstructured contents. Furthermore, we introduce two implementations of
SeKnow based on a non-pretrained sequence-to-sequence model and a pretrained
language model, respectively. Both implementations use the end-to-end manner to
jointly optimize dialog modeling grounded on structured and unstructured
knowledge. We conduct experiments on the modified version of MultiWOZ 2.1
dataset, where dialogs are processed to involve semi-structured knowledge.
Experimental results show that SeKnow has strong performances in both
end-to-end dialog and intermediate knowledge management, compared to existing
TOD systems and their extensions with pipeline knowledge management schemes.</span>

                                        <span>Tackling online hatred using informed textual responses - called counter
narratives - has been brought under the spotlight recently. Accordingly, a
research line has emerged to automatically generate counter narratives in order
to facilitate the direct intervention in the hate discussion and to prevent
hate content from further spreading. Still, current neural approaches tend to
produce generic/repetitive responses and lack grounded and up-to-date evidence
such as facts, statistics, or examples. Moreover, these models can create
plausible but not necessarily true arguments. In this paper we present the
first complete knowledge-bound counter narrative generation pipeline, grounded
in an external knowledge repository that can provide more informative content
to fight online hatred. Together with our approach, we present a series of
experiments that show its feasibility to produce suitable and informative
counter narratives in in-domain and cross-domain settings.</span>

as OpenStreetMap (OSM), unique correct answers do not necessarily exist.
Instead, the truth might be lying in the eye of the user, who needs to enter an
interactive setup where ambiguities can be resolved and parsing mistakes can be
corrected. Our work presents an approach to interactive semantic parsing where
an explicit error detection is performed, and a clarification question is
generated that pinpoints the suspected source of ambiguity or error and
communicates it to the human user. Our experimental results show that a
combination of entropy-based uncertainty detection and beam search, together
with multi-source training on clarification question, initial parse, and user
answer, results in improvements of 1.2% F1 score on a parser that already
performs at 90.26% on the NLMaps dataset for OSM semantic parsing.</span>

paper analyzes the ability of LMs to perform generalizable commonsense

experiments with these three aspects show that: (1) LMs can adapt to different
schemas defined by multiple CKGs but fail to reuse the knowledge to generalize
to new relations. (2) Adapted LMs generalize well to unseen subjects, but less
so on novel objects. Future work should investigate how to improve the

each sentence inside the bag, while accurate sentence labels are important for
downstream applications that need the exact relation type. Directly using bag
labels for sentence-level training will introduce much noise, thus severely
degrading performance. In this work, we propose the use of negative training
(NT), in which a model is trained using complementary labels regarding that
&#x60;&#x60;the instance does not belong to these complementary labels&quot;. Since the
probability of selecting a true label as a complementary label is low, NT
provides less noisy information. Furthermore, the model trained with NT is able
to separate the noisy data from the training data. Based on NT, we propose a
sentence-level framework, SENT, for distant relation extraction. SENT not only
filters the noisy data to construct a cleaner dataset, but also performs a
re-labeling process to transform the noisy data into useful training data, thus
further benefiting the model&#x27;s performance. Experimental results show the
significant improvement of the proposed method over previous methods on
sentence-level evaluation and de-noise effect.</span>

the emotion of the context to generate empathetic responses. However, empathy
is much more than generating responses with an appropriate emotion. It also
often entails subtle expressions of understanding and personal resonance with
the situation of the other interlocutor. Unfortunately, such qualities are
difficult to quantify and the datasets lack the relevant annotations. To
address this issue, in this paper we propose an approach that relies on
exemplars to cue the generative model on fine stylistic properties that signal
empathy to the interlocutor. To this end, we employ dense passage retrieval to
extract relevant exemplary responses from the training set. Three elements of
human communication -- emotional presence, interpretation, and exploration, and
sentiment are additionally introduced using synthetic labels to guide the
generation towards empathy. The human evaluation is also extended by these
elements of human communication. We empirically show that these approaches
yield significant improvements in empathetic response quality in terms of both
automated and human-evaluated metrics. The implementation is available at

                                        <span>Routing methods in capsule networks often learn a hierarchical relationship
for capsules in successive layers, but the intra-relation between capsules in
the same layer is less studied, while this intra-relation is a key factor for
the semantic understanding in text data. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce
a new capsule network with graph routing to learn both relationships, where
capsules in each layer are treated as the nodes of a graph. We investigate
strategies to yield adjacency and degree matrix with three different distances
from a layer of capsules, and propose the graph routing mechanism between those
capsules. We validate our approach on five text classification datasets, and
our findings suggest that the approach combining bottom-up routing and top-down
attention performs the best. Such an approach demonstrates generalization
capability across datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art routing methods,
the improvements in accuracy in the five datasets we used were 0.82, 0.39,

                                        <span>The goal of database question answering is to enable natural language
querying of real-life relational databases in diverse application domains.
Recently, large-scale datasets such as Spider and WikiSQL facilitated novel
modeling techniques for text-to-SQL parsing, improving zero-shot generalization
to unseen databases. In this work, we examine the challenges that still prevent
these techniques from practical deployment. First, we present KaggleDBQA, a new
cross-domain evaluation dataset of real Web databases, with domain-specific
data types, original formatting, and unrestricted questions. Second, we
re-examine the choice of evaluation tasks for text-to-SQL parsers as applied in
real-life settings. Finally, we augment our in-domain evaluation task with
database documentation, a naturally occurring source of implicit domain
knowledge. We show that KaggleDBQA presents a challenge to state-of-the-art
zero-shot parsers but a more realistic evaluation setting and creative use of
associated database documentation boosts their accuracy by over 13.2%, doubling
their performance.</span>

                                        <span>A wide variety of NLP applications, such as machine translation,
summarization, and dialog, involve text generation. One major challenge for
these applications is how to evaluate whether such generated texts are actually
fluent, accurate, or effective. In this work, we conceptualize the evaluation
of generated text as a text generation problem, modeled using pre-trained
sequence-to-sequence models. The general idea is that models trained to convert
the generated text to/from a reference output or the source text will achieve
higher scores when the generated text is better. We operationalize this idea
using BART, an encoder-decoder based pre-trained model, and propose a metric
BARTScore with a number of variants that can be flexibly applied in an
unsupervised fashion to evaluation of text from different perspectives (e.g.
informativeness, fluency, or factuality). BARTScore is conceptually simple and
empirically effective. It can outperform existing top-scoring metrics in 16 of
22 test settings, covering evaluation of 16 datasets (e.g., machine
translation, text summarization) and 7 different perspectives (e.g.,
informativeness, factuality). Code to calculate BARTScore is available at
https://github.com/neulab/BARTScore, and we have released an interactive
leaderboard for meta-evaluation at
this http URL on the ExplainaBoard
platform, which allows us to interactively understand the strengths,
weaknesses, and complementarity of each metric.</span>

                                        <span>Modern pre-trained language models are mostly built upon backbones stacking
self-attention and feed-forward layers in an interleaved order. In this paper,
beyond this stereotyped layer pattern, we aim to improve pre-trained models by
exploiting layer variety from two aspects: the layer type set and the layer
order. Specifically, besides the original self-attention and feed-forward
layers, we introduce convolution into the layer type set, which is
experimentally found beneficial to pre-trained models. Furthermore, beyond the
original interleaved order, we explore more layer orders to discover more
powerful architectures. However, the introduced layer variety leads to a large
architecture space of more than billions of candidates, while training a single
candidate model from scratch already requires huge computation cost, making it
not affordable to search such a space by directly training large amounts of
candidate models. To solve this problem, we first pre-train a supernet from
which the weights of all candidate models can be inherited, and then adopt an
evolutionary algorithm guided by pre-training accuracy to find the optimal
architecture. Extensive experiments show that LV-BERT model obtained by our
method outperforms BERT and its variants on various downstream tasks. For
example, LV-BERT-small achieves 78.8 on the GLUE testing set, 1.8 higher than
the strong baseline ELECTRA-small.</span>

speech recognition performance, and for many individuals with
moderate-to-severe speech disorders, voice operated systems do not work.
Current speech recognition systems are trained primarily with data from fluent
speakers and as a consequence do not generalize well to speech with
dysfluencies such as sound or word repetitions, sound prolongations, or audible
blocks. The focus of this work is on quantitative analysis of a consumer speech
recognition system on individuals who stutter and production-oriented
approaches for improving performance for common voice assistant tasks (i.e.,
&quot;what is the weather?&quot;). At baseline, this system introduces a significant
number of insertion and substitution errors resulting in intended speech Word
Error Rates (isWER) that are 13.64\% worse (absolute) for individuals with
fluency disorders. We show that by simply tuning the decoding parameters in an
existing hybrid speech recognition system one can improve isWER by 24\%
(relative) for individuals with fluency disorders. Tuning these parameters
translates to 3.6\% better domain recognition and 1.7\% better intent
recognition relative to the default setup for the 18 study participants across
all stuttering severities.</span>

                                        <span>Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the
concept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an
unrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In
an attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open
set environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of
incremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial
trained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and
autonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some
problems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to
retrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy
as multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new
classes is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address
these problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold
approach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies
high by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources
used in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on
the idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when
exposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method
can be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network
architecture.</span>

(mPTLMs) mainly consists of two lines of works: zero-shot approach and
translation-based approach, which have been studied extensively on the
sequence-level tasks. We further verify the efficacy of these cross-lingual
adaptation approaches by evaluating their performances on more fine-grained
sequence tagging tasks. After re-examining their strengths and drawbacks, we
propose a novel framework to consolidate the zero-shot approach and the
translation-based approach for better adaptation performance. Instead of simply
augmenting the source data with the machine-translated data, we tailor-make a
warm-up mechanism to quickly update the mPTLMs with the gradients estimated on
a few translated data. Then, the adaptation approach is applied to the refined
parameters and the cross-lingual transfer is performed in a warm-start way. The
experimental results on nine target languages demonstrate that our method is
beneficial to the cross-lingual adaptation of various sequence tagging tasks.</span>

training data is an important research direction. We, therefore, carry out a
systematic evaluation of transferability of BERT-based neural ranking models
across five English datasets. Previous studies focused primarily on zero-shot
and few-shot transfer from a large dataset to a dataset with a small number of
queries. In contrast, each of our collections has a substantial number of
queries, which enables a full-shot evaluation mode and improves reliability of
our results. Furthermore, since source datasets licences often prohibit
commercial use, we compare transfer learning to training on pseudo-labels
generated by a BM25 scorer. We find that training on pseudo-labels -- possibly
with subsequent fine-tuning using a modest number of annotated queries -- can
produce a competitive or better model compared to transfer learning. Yet, it is
necessary to improve the stability and/or effectiveness of the few-shot
training, which, sometimes, can degrade performance of a pretrained model.</span>

considered race in NLP research and development. In this work, we survey 79
papers from the ACL anthology that mention race. These papers reveal various
types of race-related bias in all stages of NLP model development, highlighting
the need for proactive consideration of how NLP systems can uphold racial
hierarchies. However, persistent gaps in research on race and NLP remain: race
has been siloed as a niche topic and remains ignored in many NLP tasks; most
work operationalizes race as a fixed single-dimensional variable with a
ground-truth label, which risks reinforcing differences produced by historical
racism; and the voices of historically marginalized people are nearly absent in
NLP literature. By identifying where and how NLP literature has and has not
considered race, especially in comparison to related fields, our work calls for
inclusion and racial justice in NLP research practices.</span>

                                        <span>Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning pipeline
to detect signals on dietary supplement-related adverse events (DS AEs) from
Twitter. Material and Methods: We obtained 247,807 tweets ranging from 2012 to
2018 that mentioned both DS and AE. We annotated biomedical entities and
relations on 2,000 randomly selected tweets. For the concept extraction task,
we compared the performance of traditional word embeddings with SVM, CRF and
LSTM-CRF classifiers to BERT models. For the relation extraction task, we
compared GloVe vectors with CNN classifiers to BERT models. We chose the best
performing models in each task to assemble an end-to-end deep learning pipeline
to detect DS AE signals and compared the results to the known DS AEs from a DS
knowledge base (i.e., iDISK). Results: In both tasks, the BERT-based models
outperformed traditional word embeddings. The best performing concept
extraction model is the BioBERT model that can identify supplement, symptom,
and body organ entities with F1-scores of 0.8646, 0.8497, and 0.7104,
respectively. The best performing relation extraction model is the BERT model
that can identify purpose and AE relations with F1-scores of 0.8335 and 0.7538,
respectively. The end-to-end pipeline was able to extract DS indication and DS
AEs with an F1-score of 0.7459 and 0,7414, respectively. Comparing to the
iDISK, we could find both known and novel DS-AEs. Conclusion: We have
demonstrated the feasibility of detecting DS AE signals from Twitter with a
BioBERT-based deep learning pipeline.</span>

                                        <span>In the text processing context, most ML models are built on word embeddings.
These embeddings are themselves trained on some datasets, potentially
containing sensitive data. In some cases this training is done independently,
in other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In
either case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based
on the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage.
But, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and
their effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these
embeddings, have remained relatively unexplored.

In this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box
membership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show
that this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications:
classification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not
exposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack
accuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model. Indeed,
our attack is a cheaper membership inference attack on text-generative models,
which does not require the knowledge of the target model or any expensive
training of text-generative models as shadow models.</span>

                                        <span>Neural machine translation (NMT) is sensitive to domain shift. In this paper,
we address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a
given budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually fine-tune a
pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing
active learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty
scores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even
when only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To
address this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based
machine translation (PBMT) era that selected not full sentences, but rather
individual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT
systems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need
to be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of
sentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to
select both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the
new domain for routing to human translators. In a German-English translation
task, our active learning approach achieves consistent improvements over
uncertainty-based sentence selection methods, improving up to 1.2 BLEU score
over strong active learning baselines.</span>

resolve the conversational dependency, such as anaphora and ellipsis. However,
existing approaches do not explicitly train QA models on how to resolve the
dependency, and thus these models are limited in understanding human dialogues.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework, ExCorD (Explicit guidance on how
to resolve Conversational Dependency) to enhance the abilities of QA models in
comprehending conversational context. ExCorD first generates self-contained
questions that can be understood without the conversation history, then trains
a QA model with the pairs of original and self-contained questions using a
consistency-based regularizer. In our experiments, we demonstrate that ExCorD
significantly improves the QA models&#x27; performance by up to 1.2 F1 on QuAC, and
5.2 F1 on CANARD, while addressing the limitations of the existing approaches.</span>

complementary techniques: (1) flexible deformation-splines for low-frequency
large-scale alignment and (2) geometry-aware depth filtering for high-frequency
alignment of fine depth details. In contrast to prior approaches, our method
does not require camera poses as input and achieves robust reconstruction for
challenging hand-held cell phone captures containing a significant amount of

                                        <span>Textures contain a wealth of image information and are widely used in various
fields such as computer graphics and computer vision. With the development of
machine learning, the texture synthesis and generation have been greatly
improved. As a very common element in everyday life, wallpapers contain a
wealth of texture information, making it difficult to annotate with a simple
single label. Moreover, wallpaper designers spend significant time to create
different styles of wallpaper. For this purpose, this paper proposes to
describe wallpaper texture images by using multi-label semantics. Based on
these labels and generative adversarial networks, we present a framework for
perception driven wallpaper texture generation and style transfer. In this
framework, a perceptual model is trained to recognize whether the wallpapers
produced by the generator network are sufficiently realistic and have the
attribute designated by given perceptual description; these multi-label
semantic attributes are treated as condition variables to generate wallpaper
images. The generated wallpaper images can be converted to those with
well-known artist styles using CycleGAN. Finally, using the aesthetic
evaluation method, the generated wallpaper images are quantitatively measured.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate
wallpaper textures conforming to human aesthetics and have artistic
characteristics.</span>

                                        <span>Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a novel cross-modal
retrieval task, where abstract sketches are used as queries to retrieve natural
images under zero-shot scenario. Most existing methods regard ZS-SBIR as a
traditional classification problem and employ a cross-entropy or triplet-based
loss to achieve retrieval, which neglect the problems of the domain gap between
sketches and natural images and the large intra-class diversity in sketches.
Toward this end, we propose a novel Domain-Smoothing Network (DSN) for ZS-SBIR.
Specifically, a cross-modal contrastive method is proposed to learn generalized
representations to smooth the domain gap by mining relations with additional
augmented samples. Furthermore, a category-specific memory bank with sketch
features is explored to reduce intra-class diversity in the sketch domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach notably outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets. Our source

                                        <span>Data augmentation has been successfully used in many areas of deep-learning
to significantly improve model performance. Typically data augmentation
simulates realistic variations in data in order to increase the apparent
diversity of the training-set. However, for opcode-based malware analysis,
where deep learning methods are already achieving state of the art performance,
it is not immediately clear how to apply data augmentation. In this paper we
study different methods of data augmentation starting with basic methods using
fixed transformations and moving to methods that adapt to the data. We propose
a novel data augmentation method based on using an opcode embedding layer
within the network and its corresponding opcode embedding matrix to perform
adaptive data augmentation during training. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first paper to carry out a systematic study of different augmentation
methods applied to opcode sequence based malware classification.</span>

                                        <span>LiDAR-based SLAM system is admittedly more accurate and stable than others,
while its loop closure detection is still an open issue. With the development
of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be
obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and
conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM
with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in
odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a
semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane
constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in
our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve
the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a
global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive
experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly
improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and
achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.</span>

task in AcitivityNet Challenge 2021. The purpose of this task is to locate and
identify actions of interest in long untrimmed videos. The crucial challenge of
the task comes from that the temporal duration of action varies dramatically,
and the target actions are typically embedded in a background of irrelevant
activities. Our solution builds on BMN, and mainly contains three steps: 1)
action classification and feature encoding by Slowfast, CSN and ViViT; 2)
proposal generation. We improve BMN by embedding the proposed Proposal Relation
Network (PRN), by which we can generate proposals of high quality; 3) action
detection. We calculate the detection results by assigning the proposals with
corresponding classification results. Finally, we ensemble the results under
different settings and achieve 44.7% on the test set, which improves the
champion result in ActivityNet 2020 by 1.9% in terms of average mAP.</span>

                                        <span>Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has achieved great interest in
recent years as skeleton data has demonstrated being robust to illumination
changes, body scales, dynamic camera views, and complex background. In
particular, Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) demonstrated
to be effective in learning both spatial and temporal dependencies on
non-Euclidean data such as skeleton graphs. Nevertheless, an effective encoding
of the latent information underlying the 3D skeleton is still an open problem,
especially when it comes to extracting effective information from joint motion
patterns and their correlations. In this work, we propose a novel
Spatial-Temporal Transformer network (ST-TR) which models dependencies between
joints using the Transformer self-attention operator. In our ST-TR model, a
Spatial Self-Attention module (SSA) is used to understand intra-frame
interactions between different body parts, and a Temporal Self-Attention module
(TSA) to model inter-frame correlations. The two are combined in a two-stream
network, whose performance is evaluated on three large-scale datasets,
NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400, consistently improving
backbone results. Compared with methods that use the same input data, the
proposed ST-TR achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets when using
joints&#x27; coordinates as input, and results on-par with state-of-the-art when
adding bones information.</span>

deep learning methods falling short of promised results when evaluated on
clinical data. We investigate the accuracy and time-savings resulting from the
use of an interactive-machine-learning method for an organ-at-risk contouring
task. We compare the method to the Eclipse contouring software and find strong
agreement with manual delineations, with a dice score of 0.95. The annotations
created using corrective-annotation also take less time to create as more
images are annotated, resulting in substantial time savings compared to manual
methods, with hearts that take 2 minutes and 2 seconds to delineate on average,
after 923 images have been delineated, compared to 7 minutes and 1 seconds when
delineating manually. Our experiment demonstrates that
interactive-machine-learning with corrective-annotation provides a fast and

segment their own structures of interest as part of routine clinical workflows.

challenging computer vision problem, with the potential to have a positive and
widespread impact on public health. Studies in this area are limited to
existing datasets in the field that lack sufficient diversity or labels
required for training models with nutritional understanding capability. We
introduce Nutrition5k, a novel dataset of 5k diverse, real world food dishes
with corresponding video streams, depth images, component weights, and high
accuracy nutritional content annotation. We demonstrate the potential of this
dataset by training a computer vision algorithm capable of predicting the
caloric and macronutrient values of a complex, real world dish at an accuracy
that outperforms professional nutritionists. Further we present a baseline for
incorporating depth sensor data to improve nutrition predictions. We will
publicly release Nutrition5k in the hope that it will accelerate innovation in
the space of nutritional understanding.</span>

                                        <span>Benefited from considerable pixel-level annotations collected from a specific
situation (source), the trained semantic segmentation model performs quite
well, but fails in a new situation (target) due to the large domain shift. To
mitigate the domain gap, previous cross-domain semantic segmentation methods
always assume the co-existence of source data and target data during
distribution alignment. However, the access to source data in the real scenario
may raise privacy concerns and violate intellectual property. To tackle this
problem, we focus on an interesting and challenging cross-domain semantic
segmentation task where only the trained source model is provided to the target
domain, and further propose a unified framework called Domain Adaptive Semantic
Segmentation without Source data (DAS$^3$ for short). Specifically, DAS$^3$
consists of three schemes, i.e., feature alignment, self-training, and
information propagation. First, we mainly develop a focal entropic loss on the
network outputs to implicitly align the target features with unseen source
features via the provided source model. Second, besides positive pseudo labels
in vanilla self-training, we first introduce negative pseudo labels to the
field and develop a bi-directional self-training strategy to enhance the
representation learning in the target domain. Finally, the information
propagation scheme further reduces the intra-domain discrepancy within the
target domain via pseudo semi-supervised learning. Extensive results on
synthesis-to-real and cross-city driving datasets validate DAS$^3$ yields
state-of-the-art performance, even on par with methods that need access to
source data.</span>

defense method against gray- and black-box attack, which is computationally
efficient and does not require any adversarial training or retraining of a
classification model. We first show that a very simple iterative Gaussian
smoothing can effectively wash out adversarial noise and achieve substantially
high robust accuracy. Based on the observation, we propose Self-Supervised
Iterative Contextual Smoothing (SSICS), which aims to reconstruct the original
discriminative features from the Gaussian-smoothed image in context-adaptive
manner, while still smoothing out the adversarial noise. From the experiments
on ImageNet, we show that our SSICS achieves both high standard accuracy and
very competitive robust accuracy for the gray- and black-box attacks; e.g.,
transfer-based PGD-attack and score-based attack. A note-worthy point to stress
is that our defense is free of computationally expensive adversarial training,

                                        <span>Recent advances in bioimaging have provided scientists a superior high
spatial-temporal resolution to observe dynamics of living cells as 3D
volumetric videos. Unfortunately, the 3D biomedical video analysis is lagging,
impeded by resource insensitive human curation using off-the-shelf 3D analytic
tools. Herein, biologists often need to discard a considerable amount of rich
3D spatial information by compromising on 2D analysis via maximum intensity
projection. Recently, pixel embedding-based cell instance segmentation and
tracking provided a neat and generalizable computing paradigm for understanding
cellular dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatial-temporal
voxel-embedding (VoxelEmbed) based learning method to perform simultaneous cell
instance segmenting and tracking on 3D volumetric video sequences. Our
contribution is in four-fold: (1) The proposed voxel embedding generalizes the
pixel embedding with 3D context information; (2) Present a simple multi-stream
learning approach that allows effective spatial-temporal embedding; (3)
Accomplished an end-to-end framework for one-stage 3D cell instance
segmentation and tracking without heavy parameter tuning; (4) The proposed 3D
quantification is memory efficient via a single GPU with 12 GB memory. We
evaluate our VoxelEmbed method on four 3D datasets (with different cell types)
from the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge. The proposed VoxelEmbed method achieved
consistent superior overall performance (OP) on two densely annotated datasets.
The performance is also competitive on two sparsely annotated cohorts with
20.6% and 2% of data-set having segmentation annotations. The results
demonstrate that the VoxelEmbed method is a generalizable and memory-efficient
solution.</span>

                                        <span>It is well known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, which are implemented by adding crafted perturbations onto
benign examples. Min-max robust optimization based adversarial training can
provide a notion of security against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial
robustness requires a significantly larger capacity of the network than that
for the natural training with only benign examples. This paper proposes a
framework of concurrent adversarial training and weight pruning that enables
model compression while still preserving the adversarial robustness and
essentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training. Furthermore, this work
studies two hypotheses about weight pruning in the conventional setting and
finds that weight pruning is essential for reducing the network model size in
the adversarial setting, training a small model from scratch even with
inherited initialization from the large model cannot achieve both adversarial
robustness and high standard accuracy. Code is available at

integrated seamlessly to the point where it is difficult to imagine a world
without them. Physical manifestations of those systems on the other hand, in
the form of embodied agents or robots, have so far been used only for specific
applications and are often limited to functional roles (e.g. in the industry,
entertainment and military fields). Given the current growth and innovation in
the research communities concerned with the topics of robot navigation,
human-robot-interaction and human activity recognition, it seems like this
might soon change. Robots are increasingly easy to obtain and use and the
acceptance of them in general is growing. However, the design of a socially
compliant robot that can function as a companion needs to take various areas of
research into account. This paper is concerned with the navigation aspect of a
socially-compliant robot and provides a survey of existing solutions for the
relevant areas of research as well as an outlook on possible future directions.</span>

trajectory information. Knowing the posterior locations of an object helps
disambiguating and solving situations such as occlusions, re-identification,
and identity switching. In this work, we show that trajectory estimation can
become a key factor for tracking, and present TrajE, a trajectory estimator
based on recurrent mixture density networks, as a generic module that can be
added to existing object trackers. To provide several trajectory hypotheses,
our method uses beam search. Also, relying on the same estimated trajectory, we
propose to reconstruct a track after an occlusion occurs. We integrate TrajE
into two state of the art tracking algorithms, CenterTrack [63] and Tracktor

experimented with five popular classification architectures on the CIFAR-10
dataset, and the empirical results indicated that our proposed auxiliary task
generally improves the classification accuracy. More notably, the results
showed that in certain cases our proposed auxiliary task may enhance the
classifiers&#x27; resistance to adversarial attacks generated using the fast
gradient sign method.</span>

                                        <span>Explainable artificial intelligence has rapidly emerged since lawmakers have
started requiring interpretable models for safety-critical domains.
Concept-based neural networks have arisen as explainable-by-design methods as
they leverage human-understandable symbols (i.e. concepts) to predict class
memberships. However, most of these approaches focus on the identification of
the most relevant concepts but do not provide concise, formal explanations of
how such concepts are leveraged by the classifier to make predictions. In this
paper, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable approach enabling the
extraction of logic explanations from neural networks using the formalism of
First-Order Logic. The method relies on an entropy-based criterion which
automatically identifies the most relevant concepts. We consider four different
case studies to demonstrate that: (i) this entropy-based criterion enables the
distillation of concise logic explanations in safety-critical domains from
clinical data to computer vision; (ii) the proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art white-box models in terms of classification accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work attempts to improve semantic segmentation performance by
exploring well-designed architectures on a target dataset. However, it remains
challenging to build a unified system that simultaneously learns from various
datasets due to the inherent distribution shift across different datasets. In
this paper, we present a simple, flexible, and general method for semantic
segmentation, termed Cross-Dataset Collaborative Learning (CDCL). Given
multiple labeled datasets, we aim to improve the generalization and
discrimination of feature representations on each dataset. Specifically, we
first introduce a family of Dataset-Aware Blocks (DAB) as the fundamental
computing units of the network, which help capture homogeneous representations
and heterogeneous statistics across different datasets. Second, we propose a
Dataset Alternation Training (DAT) mechanism to efficiently facilitate the
optimization procedure. We conduct extensive evaluations on four diverse
datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, BDD100K, CamVid, and COCO Stuff, with
single-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Experimental results demonstrate our
method consistently achieves notable improvements over prior single-dataset and
cross-dataset training methods without introducing extra FLOPs. Particularly,
with the same architecture of PSPNet (ResNet-18), our method outperforms the
single-dataset baseline by 5.65\%, 6.57\%, and 5.79\% of mIoU on the validation
sets of Cityscapes, BDD100K, CamVid, respectively. Code and models will be
released.</span>

distance fields (SDFs) that represent clothed humans from monocular depth
observations. Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit
representations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable
avatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic
cloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body
scans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of
effectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes
and cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type
optimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we
propose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars,
represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We
achieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a
hypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork is
conditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms
non-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to
effectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus
can be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We
qualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our
approach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes
faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our meta-learned hypernetwork is very
robust, being the first to generate avatars with realistic dynamic cloth
deformations given as few as 8 monocular depth frames.</span>

Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) drones is set to bloom. This led to the
creation of the theBEAST project, which aims to create an autonomous security
drone, with focus on those regulations and on safety. This technical paper
describes the first steps of a module within this project, which revolves
around detecting obstacles so they can be avoided in a fail-safe landing. A
deep learning powered object detection method is the subject of our research,
and various experiments are held to maximize its performance, such as comparing
various data augmentation techniques or YOLOv3 and YOLOv5. According to the
results of the experiments, we conclude that although object detection is a
promising approach to resolve this problem, more volume of data is required for
potential usage in a real-life application.</span>

                                        <span>Contrastive self-supervised learning has largely narrowed the gap to
supervised pre-training on ImageNet. However, its success highly relies on the
object-centric priors of ImageNet, i.e., different augmented views of the same
image correspond to the same object. Such a heavily curated constraint becomes
immediately infeasible when pre-trained on more complex scene images with many
objects. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Object-level Representation
Learning (ORL), a new self-supervised learning framework towards scene images.
Our key insight is to leverage image-level self-supervised pre-training as the
prior to discover object-level semantic correspondence, thus realizing
object-level representation learning from scene images. Extensive experiments
on COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised
learning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on
several downstream tasks. Furthermore, ORL improves the downstream performance
when more unlabeled scene images are available, demonstrating its great
potential of harnessing unlabeled data in the wild. We hope our approach can
motivate future research on more general-purpose unsupervised representation
learning from scene data. Project page: https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/orl/.</span>

                                        <span>As soon as abstract mathematical computations were adapted to computation on
digital computers, the problem of efficient representation, manipulation, and
communication of the numerical values in those computations arose. Strongly
related to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of
quantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be
distributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits
required and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This
perennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory
and/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the
forefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network
models in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas.
Moving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer
values represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the
memory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x
to 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not
surprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very
active sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations
associated with Neural Networks. In this article, we survey approaches to the
problem of quantizing the numerical values in deep Neural Network computations,
covering the advantages/disadvantages of current methods. With this survey and
its organization, we hope to have presented a useful snapshot of the current
research in quantization for Neural Networks and to have given an intelligent
organization to ease the evaluation of future research in this area.</span>

                                        <span>Predefined evenly-distributed class centroids (PEDCC) can be widely used in
models and algorithms of pattern classification, such as CNN classifiers,
classification autoencoders, clustering, and semi-supervised learning, etc. Its
basic idea is to predefine the class centers, which are evenly-distributed on
the unit hypersphere in feature space, to maximize the inter-class distance.
The previous method of generating PEDCC uses an iterative algorithm based on a
charge model, that is, the initial values of various centers (charge positions)
are randomly set from the normal distribution, and the charge positions are
updated iteratively with the help of the repulsive force between charges of the
same polarity. The class centers generated by the algorithm will produce some
errors with the theoretically evenly-distributed points, and the generation
time will be longer. This paper takes advantage of regular polyhedron in
high-dimensional space and the evenly distribution of points on the n
dimensional hypersphere to generate PEDCC mathematically. Then, we discussed
the basic and extensive characteristics of the frames formed by PEDCC. Finally,
experiments show that new algorithm is not only faster than the iterative
method, but also more accurate in position. The mathematical analysis and
experimental results of this paper can provide a theoretical tool for using
PEDCC to solve the key problems in the field of pattern recognition, such as
interpretable supervised/unsupervised learning, incremental learning,
uncertainty analysis and so on.</span>

                                        <span>In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn
a sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification
problem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous
tasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is
available at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform
cross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been
seen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make
use of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we
ablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the
performance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new
forgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is
not the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that
future algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent
forgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features.
This is especially important when the number of classes per task is small.</span>

segmenting objects belonging to a set of given classes. Most approaches only
exploit the temporal dimension to address the association problem, while
relying on single frame predictions for the segmentation mask itself. We
propose Prototypical Cross-Attention Network (PCAN), capable of leveraging rich
spatio-temporal information for online multiple object tracking and
segmentation. PCAN first distills a space-time memory into a set of prototypes
and then employs cross-attention to retrieve rich information from the past
frames. To segment each object, PCAN adopts a prototypical appearance module to
learn a set of contrastive foreground and background prototypes, which are then
propagated over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCAN outperforms
current video instance tracking and segmentation competition winners on both
Youtube-VIS and BDD100K datasets, and shows efficacy to both one-stage and
two-stage segmentation frameworks. Code will be available at

                                        <span>Tracking and reconstructing the 3D pose and geometry of two hands in
interaction is a challenging problem that has a high relevance for several
human-computer interaction applications, including AR/VR, robotics, or sign
language recognition. Existing works are either limited to simpler tracking
settings (e.g., considering only a single hand or two spatially separated
hands), or rely on less ubiquitous sensors, such as depth cameras. In contrast,
in this work we present the first real-time method for motion capture of
skeletal pose and 3D surface geometry of hands from a single RGB camera that
explicitly considers close interactions. In order to address the inherent depth
ambiguities in RGB data, we propose a novel multi-task CNN that regresses
multiple complementary pieces of information, including segmentation, dense
matchings to a 3D hand model, and 2D keypoint positions, together with newly
proposed intra-hand relative depth and inter-hand distance maps. These
predictions are subsequently used in a generative model fitting framework in
order to estimate pose and shape parameters of a 3D hand model for both hands.
We experimentally verify the individual components of our RGB two-hand tracking
and 3D reconstruction pipeline through an extensive ablation study. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our approach offers previously unseen two-hand tracking
performance from RGB, and quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms existing
RGB-based methods that were not explicitly designed for two-hand interactions.
Moreover, our method even performs on-par with depth-based real-time methods.</span>

                                        <span>Background: Colonoscopy remains the gold-standard screening for colorectal
cancer. However, significant miss rates for polyps have been reported,
particularly when there are multiple small adenomas. This presents an
opportunity to leverage computer-aided systems to support clinicians and reduce
the number of polyps missed.

Method: In this work we introduce the Focus U-Net, a novel dual
attention-gated deep neural network, which combines efficient spatial and
channel-based attention into a single Focus Gate module to encourage selective
learning of polyp features. The Focus U-Net further incorporates short-range
skip connections and deep supervision. Furthermore, we introduce the Hybrid
Focal loss, a new compound loss function based on the Focal loss and Focal
Tversky loss, to handle class-imbalanced image segmentation. For our
experiments, we selected five public datasets containing images of polyps
obtained during optical colonoscopy: CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB,
ETIS-Larib PolypDB and EndoScene test set. To evaluate model performance, we
use the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU)
metrics.

Results: Our model achieves state-of-the-art results for both CVC-ClinicDB
and Kvasir-SEG, with a mean DSC of 0.941 and 0.910, respectively. When
evaluated on a combination of five public polyp datasets, our model similarly
achieves state-of-the-art results with a mean DSC of 0.878 and mean IoU of
0.809, a 14% and 15% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results of
0.768 and 0.702, respectively.

Conclusions: This study shows the potential for deep learning to provide fast
and accurate polyp segmentation results for use during colonoscopy. The Focus
U-Net may be adapted for future use in newer non-invasive screening and more
broadly to other biomedical image segmentation tasks involving class imbalance
and requiring efficiency.</span>

2D images has been a long-standing problem in computer vision. In this paper,
we introduce a new analysis-by-synthesis technique capable of producing
high-quality reconstructions through robust coarse-to-fine optimization and
physics-based differentiable rendering.

Unlike most previous methods that handle geometry and reflectance largely
separately, our method unifies the optimization of both by leveraging image
gradients with respect to both object reflectance and geometry. To obtain
physically accurate gradient estimates, we develop a new GPU-based Monte Carlo
differentiable renderer leveraging recent advances in differentiable rendering
theory to offer unbiased gradients while enjoying better performance than
existing tools like PyTorch3D and redner. To further improve robustness, we
utilize several shape and material priors as well as a coarse-to-fine
optimization strategy to reconstruct geometry. We demonstrate that our
technique can produce reconstructions with higher quality than previous methods
such as COLMAP and Kinect Fusion.</span>

a given problem typically makes it hard to solve. A popular approach to address
nonsmooth terms in convex optimization is to approximate them with their
respective Moreau envelopes. In this work, we study the use of Lasry-Lions
double envelopes to approximate nonsmooth terms that are also not convex. These
envelopes are an extension of the Moreau ones but exhibit an additional
smoothness property that makes them amenable to fast optimization algorithms.
Lasry-Lions envelopes can also be seen as an &quot;intermediate&quot; between a given
function and its convex envelope, and we make use of this property to develop a
method that builds a sequence of approximate subproblems that are easier to
solve than the original problem. We discuss convergence properties of this
method when used to address composite minimization problems; additionally,
based on a number of experiments, we discuss settings where it may be more
useful than classical alternatives in two domains: signal decoding and spectral
unmixing.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted
great interest due to its tremendous potentials in learning discriminative
representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes,
existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency,
e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for
comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we discover two contradictory
phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and
over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency.
Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the
dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for
contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object
categories. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn the
feature representation from excessive negative sample pairs, which enforces the
model to over-cluster samples of the same actual categories into different
clusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel
self-supervised learning framework using a median triplet loss. Precisely, we
employ a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the
positive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and
we construct the negative pair by selecting the negative sample of a median
similarity score from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering
problem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively
evaluate our proposed framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g.,
ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results demonstrate the superior performance
(e.g., the learning efficiency) of our model over the latest state-of-the-art
methods by a clear margin. Codes available at:

time-series analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel diffeomorphic temporal
transformer network for both pairwise and joint time-series alignment. Our
ResNet-TW (Deep Residual Network for Time Warping) tackles the alignment
problem by compositing a flow of incremental diffeomorphic mappings. Governed
by the flow equation, our Residual Network (ResNet) builds smooth, fluid and
regular flows of velocity fields and consequently generates smooth and
invertible transformations (i.e. diffeomorphic warping functions). Inspired by
the elegant Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework,
the final transformation is built by the flow of time-dependent vector fields
which are none other than the building blocks of our Residual Network. The
latter is naturally viewed as an Eulerian discretization schema of the flow
equation (an ODE). Once trained, our ResNet-TW aligns unseen data by a single
inexpensive forward pass. As we show in experiments on both univariate (84
datasets from UCR archive) and multivariate time-series (MSR Action-3D,
Florence-3D and MSR Daily Activity), ResNet-TW achieves competitive performance

end-to-end pipeline and competitive results on several fundamental computer
vision tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation. However, how to establish a query based video instance
segmentation (VIS) framework with elegant architecture and strong performance
remains to be settled. In this paper, we present \textbf{QueryTrack} (i.e.,
tracking instances as queries), a unified query based VIS framework fully
leveraging the intrinsic one-to-one correspondence between instances and
queries in QueryInst. The proposed method obtains 52.7 / 52.3 AP on
YouTube-VIS-2019 / 2021 datasets, which wins the 2-nd place in the YouTube-VIS
Challenge at CVPR 2021 \textbf{with a single online end-to-end model, single
scale testing \&amp; modest amount of training data}. We also provide
QueryTrack-ResNet-50 baseline results on YouTube-VIS-2021 dataset as references

                                        <span>Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model
robustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus
on the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role
of each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,
we propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,
we provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark
datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.
Surprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among
classes, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust
models. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and
find that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among
different attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger
attack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly
from a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with
less robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple
but effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named
Temperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity
among classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each
image. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than
the PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some
modifications in the training and inference phases to improve the robustness of
the most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise
robustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise
properties in robust models.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks designed for vision tasks are often prone to failure
when they encounter environmental conditions not covered by the training data.
Single-modal strategies are insufficient when the sensor fails to acquire
information due to malfunction or its design limitations. Multi-sensor
configurations are known to provide redundancy, increase reliability, and are
crucial in achieving robustness against asymmetric sensor failures. To address
the issue of changing lighting conditions and asymmetric sensor degradation in
object detection, we develop a multi-modal 2D object detector, and propose
deterministic and stochastic sensor-aware feature fusion strategies. The
proposed fusion mechanisms are driven by the estimated sensor measurement
reliability values/weights. Reliable object detection in harsh lighting
conditions is essential for applications such as self-driving vehicles and
human-robot interaction. We also propose a new &quot;r-blended&quot; hybrid depth
modality for RGB-D sensors. Through extensive experimentation, we show that the
proposed strategies outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods on the
FLIR-Thermal dataset, and obtain promising results on the SUNRGB-D dataset. We
additionally record a new RGB-Infra indoor dataset, namely L515-Indoors, and
demonstrate that the proposed object detection methodologies are highly
effective for a variety of lighting conditions.</span>

tracking based on calibrated multi-view. The main challenge lies in finding the
cross-view and temporal correspondences correctly even when several human pose
estimations are noisy. Compare to previous solutions that construct 3D poses
from multiple views, our approach takes advantage of temporal consistency to
match the 2D poses estimated with previously constructed 3D skeletons in every
view. Therefore cross-view and temporal associations are accomplished
simultaneously. Since the performance suffers from mistaken association and
noisy predictions, we design two strategies for aiming better correspondences
and 3D reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a part-aware measurement for
2D-3D association and a filter that can cope with 2D outliers during
reconstruction. Our approach is efficient and effective comparing to
state-of-the-art methods; it achieves competitive results on two benchmarks:
96.8% on Campus and 97.4% on Shelf. Moreover, we extends the length of Campus
evaluation frames to be more challenging and our proposal also reach
well-performed result.</span>

including the tongue, jaw and lips. Modeling the dynamics of the vocal tract
deformation is a fundamental problem to understand the speech, which is the
most common way for human daily communication. Researchers employ several
sensory streams to describe the process simultaneously, which are
incontrovertibly statistically related to other streams. In this paper, we
address the following question: given an observable image sequences of lips,
can we picture the corresponding tongue motion. We formulated this problem as
the self-supervised learning problem, and employ the two-stream convolutional
network and long-short memory network for the learning task, with the attention
mechanism. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by leveraging the
unlabeled lip videos to predict an upcoming ultrasound tongue image sequence.
The results show that our model is able to generate images that close to the
real ultrasound tongue images, and results in the matching between two imaging

million volunteers, collecting health-related information on genetics,

100,000 subjects, with 70,000 follow-up sessions, enabling measurements of

This work presents an experimental inference engine that can automatically

composition by DXA, organ volumes, and abstract properties like grip strength,

automatically analyze thousands of subjects within hours and provide individual

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retraining. Our key innovation is to
redefine the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration
of network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between
pruning and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves minimal loss of SNNs&#x27; performance on MNIST and
CIFAR-10 dataset so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under
unprecedented 0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining
capability in SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high
redundancy in deep SNNs. Our codes are available at

adversarial perturbations to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which
can be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the
training set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference
stage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is
added to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the
perturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input
image will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing
defense works, the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low
computational resources and maintains the visual quality of the images.
Experimental results show that, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed
defense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and
GTSRB datasets, respectively. Besides, the proposed method maintains the visual
quality of the image as the l2 norm of the added perturbation are as low as
2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets,
respectively. In addition, it is also demonstrated that the proposed method can
achieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different
attack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern).
Compared with the existing defense work (STRIP), the proposed method has better
detection performance on all the three datasets, and is more efficient than
STRIP.</span>

look at objects. However, a survey of current works reveals that existing
gaze-related datasets annotate only the pixel being looked at, and not the
boundaries of a specific object of interest. This lack of object annotation
presents an opportunity for further advancing gaze estimation research. To this
end, we present a challenging new task called gaze object prediction, where the
goal is to predict a bounding box for a person&#x27;s gazed-at object. To train and
evaluate gaze networks on this task, we present the Gaze On Objects (GOO)
dataset. GOO is composed of a large set of synthetic images (GOO Synth)
supplemented by a smaller subset of real images (GOO-Real) of people looking at
objects in a retail environment. Our work establishes extensive baselines on
GOO by re-implementing and evaluating selected state-of-the art models on the
task of gaze following and domain adaptation. Code is available on github.</span>

                                        <span>Recently demonstrated physical-world adversarial attacks have exposed
vulnerabilities in perception systems that pose severe risks for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. These attacks place
adversarial artifacts in the physical world that indirectly cause the addition
of a universal patch to inputs of a model that can fool it in a variety of
contexts. Adversarial training is the most effective defense against
image-dependent adversarial attacks. However, tailoring adversarial training to
universal patches is computationally expensive since the optimal universal
patch depends on the model weights which change during training. We propose
meta adversarial training (MAT), a novel combination of adversarial training
with meta-learning, which overcomes this challenge by meta-learning universal
patches along with model training. MAT requires little extra computation while
continuously adapting a large set of patches to the current model. MAT
considerably increases robustness against universal patch attacks on image
classification and traffic-light detection.</span>

                                        <span>Probabilistic Face Embeddings (PFE) can improve face recognition performance
in unconstrained scenarios by integrating data uncertainty into the feature
representation. However, existing PFE methods tend to be over-confident in
estimating uncertainty and is too slow to apply to large-scale face matching.
This paper proposes a regularized probabilistic face embedding method to
improve the robustness and speed of PFE. Specifically, the mutual likelihood
score (MLS) metric used in PFE is simplified to speedup the matching of face
feature pairs. Then, an output-constraint loss is proposed to penalize the
variance of the uncertainty output, which can regularize the output of the
neural network. In addition, an identification preserving loss is proposed to
improve the discriminative of the MLS metric, and a multi-layer feature fusion
module is proposed to improve the neural network&#x27;s uncertainty estimation
ability. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve
comparable or better results in 9 benchmarks than the state-of-the-art methods,
and can improve the performance of risk-controlled face recognition. The code

single RGB image. The key idea is to optimize for detection, alignment and
shape jointly over all objects in the RGB image, while focusing on realistic
and physically plausible reconstructions. To this end, we propose a keypoint
detector that localizes objects as center points and directly predicts all
object properties, including 9-DoF bounding boxes and 3D shapes -- all in a
single forward pass. The proposed method formulates 3D shape reconstruction as
a shape selection problem, i.e. it selects among exemplar shapes from a given
database. This makes it agnostic to shape representations, which enables a
lightweight reconstruction of realistic and visually-pleasing shapes based on
CAD-models, while the training objective is formulated around point clouds and
voxel representations. A collision-loss promotes non-intersecting objects,
further increasing the reconstruction realism. Given the RGB image, the
presented approach performs lightweight reconstruction in a single-stage, it is
real-time capable, fully differentiable and end-to-end trainable. Our
experiments compare multiple approaches for 9-DoF bounding box estimation,
evaluate the novel shape-selection mechanism and compare to recent methods in

various deep learning (DL)-based architectures have been proposed for
generating radiology reports for medical images. However, model uncertainty
(i.e., model reliability/confidence on report generation) is still an
under-explored problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method to explicitly

of radiology report generation. Such multi-modal uncertainties can sufficiently
capture the model confidence scores at both the report-level and the
sentence-level, and thus they are further leveraged to weight the losses for
achieving more comprehensive model optimization. Our experimental results have
demonstrated that our proposed method for model uncertainty characterization
and estimation can provide more reliable confidence scores for radiology report
generation, and our proposed uncertainty-weighted losses can achieve more
comprehensive model optimization and result in state-of-the-art performance on

learning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under
challenging multi-object scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods learn to
decode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and
segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple
times computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating
Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects
uniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate
multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can
simultaneously process the matching and segmentation decoding of multiple
objects as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling
multi-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for
constructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive
experiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT
variant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our AOT-L
outperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks,
i.e., YouTube-VOS (83.7% J&amp;F), DAVIS 2017 (83.0%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.0%),
while keeping more than 3X faster multi-object run-time. Meanwhile, our AOT-T
can maintain real-time multi-object speed on the above benchmarks. We ranked
1st in the 3rd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge. The code will

their success hinges on large amounts of labeled data. To reduce the dependency
on labels, various active-learning strategies have been proposed, typically
based on the confidence of the detector. However, these methods are biased
towards best-performing classes and can lead to acquired datasets that are not
good representatives of the data in the testing set. In this work, we propose a
unified framework for active learning, that considers both the uncertainty and
the robustness of the detector, ensuring that the network performs accurately
in all classes. Furthermore, our method is able to pseudo-label the very
confident predictions, suppressing a potential distribution drift while further
boosting the performance of the model. Experiments show that our method
comprehensively outperforms a wide range of active-learning methods on PASCAL
VOC07+12 and MS-COCO, having up to a 7.7% relative improvement, or up to 82%

                                        <span>Recently, the single image super-resolution (SISR) approaches with deep and
complex convolutional neural network structures have achieved promising
performance. However, those methods improve the performance at the cost of
higher memory consumption, which is difficult to be applied for some mobile
devices with limited storage and computing resources. To solve this problem, we
present a lightweight multi-scale feature interaction network (MSFIN). For
lightweight SISR, MSFIN expands the receptive field and adequately exploits the
informative features of the low-resolution observed images from various scales
and interactive connections. In addition, we design a lightweight recurrent
residual channel attention block (RRCAB) so that the network can benefit from
the channel attention mechanism while being sufficiently lightweight. Extensive
experiments on some benchmarks have confirmed that our proposed MSFIN can
achieve comparable performance against the state-of-the-arts with a more
lightweight model.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning methods offer pre-training techniques optimized for easier
later adaptation of the model to new classes (unseen during training) using one
or a few examples. This adaptivity to unseen classes is especially important
for many practical applications where the pre-trained label space cannot remain
fixed for effective use and the model needs to be &quot;specialized&quot; to support new
categories on the fly. One particularly interesting scenario, essentially
overlooked by the few-shot literature, is Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot (C2FS), where
the training classes (e.g. animals) are of much &#x60;coarser granularity&#x27; than the
target (test) classes (e.g. breeds). A very practical example of C2FS is when
the target classes are sub-classes of the training classes. Intuitively, it is
especially challenging as (both regular and few-shot) supervised pre-training
tends to learn to ignore intra-class variability which is essential for
separating sub-classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel &#x27;Angular
normalization&#x27; module that allows to effectively combine supervised and
self-supervised contrastive pre-training to approach the proposed C2FS task,
demonstrating significant gains in a broad study over multiple baselines and
datasets. We hope that this work will help to pave the way for future research
on this new, challenging, and very practical topic of C2FS classification.</span>

                                        <span>Traditional image resizing methods usually work in pixel space and use
various saliency measures. The challenge is to adjust the image shape while
trying to preserve important content. In this paper we perform image resizing
in feature space where the deep layers of a neural network contain rich
important semantic information. We directly adjust the image feature maps,
extracted from a pre-trained classification network, and reconstruct the
resized image using a neural-network based optimization. This novel approach
leverages the hierarchical encoding of the network, and in particular, the
high-level discriminative power of its deeper layers, that recognizes semantic
objects and regions and allows maintaining their aspect ratio. Our use of
reconstruction from deep features diminishes the artifacts introduced by
image-space resizing operators. We evaluate our method on benchmarks, compare
to alternative approaches, and demonstrate its strength on challenging images.</span>

driving system, we present a large-scale benchmark for standardizing the
evaluation of different self-supervised and semi-supervised approaches by
learning from raw data, which is the first and largest benchmark to date.
Existing autonomous driving systems heavily rely on &#x60;perfect&#x27; visual perception
models (e.g., detection) trained using extensive annotated data to ensure the
safety. However, it is unrealistic to elaborately label instances of all
scenarios and circumstances (e.g., night, extreme weather, cities) when
deploying a robust autonomous driving system. Motivated by recent powerful
advances of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, a promising direction
is to learn a robust detection model by collaboratively exploiting large-scale
unlabeled data and few labeled data. Existing dataset (e.g., KITTI, Waymo)
either provides only a small amount of data or covers limited domains with full
annotation, hindering the exploration of large-scale pre-trained models. Here,
we release a Large-Scale Object Detection benchmark for Autonomous driving,
named as SODA10M, containing 10 million unlabeled images and 20K images labeled
with 6 representative object categories. To improve diversity, the images are
collected every ten seconds per frame within 32 different cities under
different weather conditions, periods and location scenes. We provide extensive
experiments and deep analyses of existing supervised state-of-the-art detection
models, popular self-supervised and semi-supervised approaches, and some
insights about how to develop future models. The data and more up-to-date
information have been released at https://soda-2d.github.io.</span>

networks becoming overconfident. We present a confidence-aware camouflaged
object detection framework using dynamic supervision to produce both accurate
camouflage map and meaningful &quot;confidence&quot; representing model awareness about
the current prediction. A camouflaged object detection network is designed to
produce our camouflage prediction. Then, we concatenate it with the input image
and feed it to the confidence estimation network to produce an one channel
confidence map.We generate dynamic supervision for the confidence estimation
network, representing the agreement of camouflage prediction with the ground
truth camouflage map. With the produced confidence map, we introduce
confidence-aware learning with the confidence map as guidance to pay more
attention to the hard/low-confidence pixels in the loss function. We claim
that, once trained, our confidence estimation network can evaluate pixel-wise
accuracy of the prediction without relying on the ground truth camouflage map.
Extensive results on four camouflaged object detection testing datasets
illustrate the superior performance of the proposed model in explaining the
camouflage prediction.</span>

                                        <span>High quality facial image editing is a challenging problem in the movie
post-production industry, requiring a high degree of control and identity
preservation. Previous works that attempt to tackle this problem may suffer
from the entanglement of facial attributes and the loss of the person&#x27;s
identity. Furthermore, many algorithms are limited to a certain task. To tackle
these limitations, we propose to edit facial attributes via the latent space of
a StyleGAN generator, by training a dedicated latent transformation network and
incorporating explicit disentanglement and identity preservation terms in the
loss function. We further introduce a pipeline to generalize our face editing
to videos. Our model achieves a disentangled, controllable, and
identity-preserving facial attribute editing, even in the challenging case of
real (i.e., non-synthetic) images and videos. We conduct extensive experiments
on image and video datasets and show that our model outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and quantitative evaluation.</span>

gradually become a hot spot. In this paper, we compare the classification
performance of different deep learning for the problem that transparent images
are difficult to analyze. We crop the transparent images into 8 * 8 and 224 *
224 pixels patches in the same proportion, and then divide the two different
pixels patches into foreground and background according to groundtruch. We also
use 4 types of convolutional neural networks and a novel ViT network model to
compare the foreground and background classification experiments. We conclude
that ViT performs the worst in classifying 8 * 8 pixels patches, but it
outperforms most convolutional neural networks in classifying 224 * 224.</span>

                                        <span>Image segmentation is a common and challenging task in autonomous driving.
Availability of sufficient pixel-level annotations for the training data is a
hurdle. Active learning helps learning from small amounts of data by suggesting
the most promising samples for labeling. In this work, we propose a new
pool-based method for active learning, which proposes promising image regions,
in each acquisition step. The problem is framed in an exploration-exploitation
framework by combining an embedding based on Uniform Manifold Approximation to
model representativeness with entropy as uncertainty measure to model
informativeness. We applied our proposed method to the challenging autonomous
driving data sets CamVid and Cityscapes and performed a quantitative comparison
with state-of-the-art methods. We find that our active learning method achieves
better performance on CamVid compared to other methods, while on Cityscapes,
the performance lift was negligible.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning aims to transfer information from one task to enable
generalization on novel tasks given a few examples. This information is present
both in the domain and the class labels. In this work we investigate the
complementary roles of these two sources of information by combining
instance-discriminative contrastive learning and supervised learning in a
single framework called Supervised Momentum Contrastive learning (SUPMOCO). Our
approach avoids a problem observed in supervised learning where information in
images not relevant to the task is discarded, which hampers their
generalization to novel tasks. We show that (self-supervised) contrastive
learning and supervised learning are mutually beneficial, leading to a new
state-of-the-art on the META-DATASET - a recently introduced benchmark for
few-shot learning. Our method is based on a simple modification of MOCO and
scales better than prior work on combining supervised and self-supervised
learning. This allows us to easily combine data from multiple domains leading
to further improvements.</span>

not. We evaluate our network on 3 different datasets: MNIST, LSUN and CelebA
dataset. Our network beats the previous state of the art using MMD, SSIM, log

                                        <span>Geometric Deep Learning has recently made striking progress with the advent
of continuous Deep Implicit Fields. They allow for detailed modeling of
watertight surfaces of arbitrary topology while not relying on a 3D Euclidean
grid, resulting in a learnable parameterization that is unlimited in
resolution. Unfortunately, these methods are often unsuitable for applications
that require an explicit mesh-based surface representation because converting
an implicit field to such a representation relies on the Marching Cubes
algorithm, which cannot be differentiated with respect to the underlying
implicit field. In this work, we remove this limitation and introduce a
differentiable way to produce explicit surface mesh representations from Deep
Implicit Fields. Our key insight is that by reasoning on how implicit field
perturbations impact local surface geometry, one can ultimately differentiate
the 3D location of surface samples with respect to the underlying deep implicit
field. We exploit this to define DeepMesh -- end-to-end differentiable mesh
representation that can vary its topology. We use two different applications to
validate our theoretical insight: Single view 3D Reconstruction via
Differentiable Rendering and Physically-Driven Shape Optimization. In both
cases our end-to-end differentiable parameterization gives us an edge over
state-of-the-art algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Pruning is an effective method to reduce the memory footprint and FLOPs
associated with neural network models. However, existing structured-pruning
methods often result in significant accuracy degradation for moderate pruning
levels. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hessian Aware Pruning (HAP)
method coupled with a Neural Implant approach that uses second-order
sensitivity as a metric for structured pruning. The basic idea is to prune
insensitive components and to use a Neural Implant for moderately sensitive
components, instead of completely pruning them. For the latter approach, the
moderately sensitive components are replaced with with a low rank implant that
is smaller and less computationally expensive than the original component. We
use the relative Hessian trace to measure sensitivity, as opposed to the
magnitude based sensitivity metric commonly used in the literature. We test HAP
for both computer vision tasks and natural language tasks, and we achieve new
state-of-the-art results. Specifically, HAP achieves less than $0.1\%$/$0.5\%$
degradation on PreResNet29/ResNet50 (CIFAR-10/ImageNet) with more than
70\%/50\% of parameters pruned. Meanwhile, HAP also achieves significantly
better performance (up to 0.8\% with 60\% of parameters pruned) as compared to
gradient based method for head pruning on transformer-based models. The
framework has been open sourced and available online.</span>

non-technical geospatial domain experts to experiment with domain-specific
signals and datasets for solving a variety of complex problems on their own.
This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex
Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning
models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the
ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic
segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts
derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a
scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for
domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving
business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation
and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and
deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its

                                        <span>Automatically recognizing the layout of handwritten documents is an important
step towards useful extraction of information from those documents. The most
common application is to feed downstream applications such as automatic text
recognition and keyword spotting; however, the recognition of the layout also
helps to establish relationships between elements in the document which allows
to enrich the information that can be extracted. Most of the modern document
layout analysis systems are designed to address only one part of the document
layout problem, namely: baseline detection or region segmentation. In contrast,
we evaluate the effectiveness of the Mask-RCNN architecture to address the
problem of baseline detection and region segmentation in an integrated manner.
We present experimental results on two handwritten text datasets and one
handwritten music dataset. The analyzed architecture yields promising results,
outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in all three datasets.</span>

compact device, requiring only a phase or amplitude mask placed close to the
sensor. They have been demonstrated for 2D and 3D microscopy, single-shot
video, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging; in each of these cases, a
compressive-sensing-based inverse problem is solved in order to recover a 3D
data-cube from a 2D measurement. Typically, this is accomplished using convex
optimization and hand-picked priors. Alternatively, deep learning-based
reconstruction methods offer the promise of better priors, but require many
thousands of ground truth training pairs, which can be difficult or impossible
to acquire. In this work, we propose the use of untrained networks for
compressive image recovery. Our approach does not require any labeled training
data, but instead uses the measurement itself to update the network weights. We
demonstrate our untrained approach on lensless compressive 2D imaging as well
as single-shot high-speed video recovery using the camera&#x27;s rolling shutter,
and single-shot hyperspectral imaging. We provide simulation and experimental
verification, showing that our method results in improved image quality over
existing methods.</span>

from an existing labeled domain to a new domain. However, existing
disentanglement-based methods do not fully consider separation between
domain-invariant and domain-specific features, which means the domain-invariant
features are not discriminative. The reconstructed features are also not
sufficiently used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel enhanced
separable disentanglement (ESD) model. We first employ a disentangler to
distill domain-invariant and domain-specific features. Then, we apply feature
separation enhancement processes to minimize contamination between
domain-invariant and domain-specific features. Finally, our model reconstructs
complete feature vectors, which are used for further disentanglement during the
training phase. Extensive experiments from three benchmark datasets outperform
state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging cross-domain tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Analyzing the structure of proteins is a key part of understanding their
functions and thus their role in biology at the molecular level. In addition,
design new proteins in a methodical way is a major engineering challenge. In
this work, we introduce a joint geometric-neural networks approach for
comparing, deforming and generating 3D protein structures. Viewing protein
structures as 3D open curves, we adopt the Square Root Velocity Function (SRVF)
representation and leverage its suitable geometric properties along with Deep
Residual Networks (ResNets) for a joint registration and comparison. Our
ResNets handle better large protein deformations while being more
computationally efficient. On top of the mathematical framework, we further
design a Geometric Variational Auto-Encoder (G-VAE), that once trained, maps
original, previously unseen structures, into a low-dimensional (latent)
hyper-sphere. Motivated by the spherical structure of the pre-shape space, we
naturally adopt the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model our hidden
variables. We test the effectiveness of our models by generating novel protein
structures and predicting completions of corrupted protein structures.
Experimental results show that our method is able to generate plausible
structures, different from the structures in the training data.</span>

speech recognition performance, and for many individuals with
moderate-to-severe speech disorders, voice operated systems do not work.
Current speech recognition systems are trained primarily with data from fluent
speakers and as a consequence do not generalize well to speech with
dysfluencies such as sound or word repetitions, sound prolongations, or audible
blocks. The focus of this work is on quantitative analysis of a consumer speech
recognition system on individuals who stutter and production-oriented
approaches for improving performance for common voice assistant tasks (i.e.,
&quot;what is the weather?&quot;). At baseline, this system introduces a significant
number of insertion and substitution errors resulting in intended speech Word
Error Rates (isWER) that are 13.64\% worse (absolute) for individuals with
fluency disorders. We show that by simply tuning the decoding parameters in an
existing hybrid speech recognition system one can improve isWER by 24\%
(relative) for individuals with fluency disorders. Tuning these parameters
translates to 3.6\% better domain recognition and 1.7\% better intent
recognition relative to the default setup for the 18 study participants across
all stuttering severities.</span>

sophisticated data augmentation schemes to expand the amount of training data

scenario, data augmentation can be used not only to expand the number of images

performing image analysis tasks such as classification with limited labeled
data. Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
semi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification
and discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate
data distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While
progress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are
small-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable
and unattainable. We therefore, propose a novel GAN model namely External
Classifier GAN (EC-GAN), that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to
improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN
to generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More
specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the
GAN&#x27;s generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator.
Our experiments demonstrate that EC-GAN&#x27;s performance is comparable to the
shared architecture method, far superior to the standard data augmentation and
regularization-based approach, and effective on a small, realistic dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Chinese character recognition has attracted much research interest due to its
wide applications. Although it has been studied for many years, some issues in
this field have not been completely resolved yet, e.g. the zero-shot problem.
Previous character-based and radical-based methods have not fundamentally
addressed the zero-shot problem since some characters or radicals in test sets
may not appear in training sets under a data-hungry condition. Inspired by the
fact that humans can generalize to know how to write characters unseen before
if they have learned stroke orders of some characters, we propose a
stroke-based method by decomposing each character into a sequence of strokes,
which are the most basic units of Chinese characters. However, we observe that
there is a one-to-many relationship between stroke sequences and Chinese
characters. To tackle this challenge, we employ a matching-based strategy to
transform the predicted stroke sequence to a specific character. We evaluate
the proposed method on handwritten characters, printed artistic characters, and
scene characters. The experimental results validate that the proposed method
outperforms existing methods on both character zero-shot and radical zero-shot
tasks. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily generalized to other
languages whose characters can be decomposed into strokes.</span>

                                        <span>Deep hashing models have been proposed as an efficient method for large-scale
similarity search. However, most existing deep hashing methods only utilize
fine-level labels for training while ignoring the natural semantic hierarchy
structure. This paper presents an effective method that preserves the classwise
similarity of full-level semantic hierarchy for large-scale image retrieval.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method helps improve the
fine-level retrieval performance. Moreover, with the help of the semantic
hierarchy, it can produce significantly better binary codes for hierarchical
retrieval, which indicates its potential of providing more user-desired
retrieval results.</span>

                                        <span>In many computer vision classification tasks, class priors at test time often
differ from priors on the training set. In the case of such prior shift,
classifiers must be adapted correspondingly to maintain close to optimal
performance. This paper analyzes methods for adaptation of probabilistic
classifiers to new priors and for estimating new priors on an unlabeled test
set. We propose a novel method to address a known issue of prior estimation
methods based on confusion matrices, where inconsistent estimates of decision
probabilities and confusion matrices lead to negative values in the estimated
priors. Experiments on fine-grained image classification datasets provide
insight into the best practice of prior shift estimation and classifier
adaptation and show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results
in prior adaptation. Applying the best practice to two tasks with naturally
imbalanced priors, learning from web-crawled images and plant species
classification, increased the recognition accuracy by 1.1% and 3.4%
respectively.</span>

Property protection of generative models. Prior solutions for discriminative
models usually adopt adversarial examples as the fingerprints, which give
anomalous inference behaviors and prediction results. Hence, these methods are
not stealthy and can be easily recognized by the adversary. Our approach
leverages the invisible backdoor technique to overcome the above limitation.
Specifically, we design verification samples, whose model outputs look normal
but can trigger a backdoor classifier to make abnormal predictions. We propose
a new backdoor embedding approach with Unique-Triplet Loss and fine-grained
categorization to enhance the effectiveness of our fingerprints. Extensive
evaluations show that this solution can outperform other strategies with higher
robustness, uniqueness and stealthiness for various GAN models.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a highly robust GAN-based framework for digitizing a normalized
3D avatar of a person from a single unconstrained photo. While the input image
can be of a smiling person or taken in extreme lighting conditions, our method
can reliably produce a high-quality textured model of a person&#x27;s face in
neutral expression and skin textures under diffuse lighting condition.
Cutting-edge 3D face reconstruction methods use non-linear morphable face
models combined with GAN-based decoders to capture the likeness and details of
a person but fail to produce neutral head models with unshaded albedo textures
which is critical for creating relightable and animation-friendly avatars for
integration in virtual environments. The key challenges for existing methods to
work is the lack of training and ground truth data containing normalized 3D
faces. We propose a two-stage approach to address this problem. First, we adopt
a highly robust normalized 3D face generator by embedding a non-linear
morphable face model into a StyleGAN2 network. This allows us to generate
detailed but normalized facial assets. This inference is then followed by a
perceptual refinement step that uses the generated assets as regularization to
cope with the limited available training samples of normalized faces. We
further introduce a Normalized Face Dataset, which consists of a combination
photogrammetry scans, carefully selected photographs, and generated fake people
with neutral expressions in diffuse lighting conditions. While our prepared
dataset contains two orders of magnitude less subjects than cutting edge
GAN-based 3D facial reconstruction methods, we show that it is possible to
produce high-quality normalized face models for very challenging unconstrained
input images, and demonstrate superior performance to the current
state-of-the-art.</span>

benchmark for autonomous driving. While there is a growing body of ML-based
motion planners, the lack of established datasets and metrics has limited the
progress in this area. Existing benchmarks for autonomous vehicle motion
prediction have focused on short-term motion forecasting, rather than long-term
planning. This has led previous works to use open-loop evaluation with L2-based
metrics, which are not suitable for fairly evaluating long-term planning. Our
benchmark overcomes these limitations by introducing a large-scale driving
dataset, lightweight closed-loop simulator, and motion-planning-specific
metrics. We provide a high-quality dataset with 1500h of human driving data
from 4 cities across the US and Asia with widely varying traffic patterns
(Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Singapore). We will provide a closed-loop
simulation framework with reactive agents and provide a large set of both
general and scenario-specific planning metrics. We plan to release the dataset
at NeurIPS 2021 and organize benchmark challenges starting in early 2022.</span>

modern world. If the current trend continues, it is most likely that the
quality of life, in general, is significantly affected since obesity is
associated with other chronic diseases such as hypertension, irregular blood
sugar levels, and increased risk of heart attacks. The primary cause of these
problems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits, with emphasis
on a select few food groups such as sugars, fats, and carbohydrates. In this
regard, computer-based food recognition offers automatic visual-based methods
to assess dietary intake and help people make healthier choices. Thus, the
following paper presents a brief review of visual-based methods for food
recognition, including their accuracy, performance, and the use of popular food
databases to evaluate existing models. The work further aims to highlight
future challenges in this area. New high-quality studies for developing
standard benchmarks and using continual learning methods for food recognition

                                        <span>Light field technology has increasingly attracted the attention of the
research community with its many possible applications. The lenslet array in
commercial plenoptic cameras helps capture both the spatial and angular
information of light rays in a single exposure. While the resulting high
dimensionality of light field data enables its superior capabilities, it also
impedes its extensive adoption. Hence, there is a compelling need for efficient
compression of light field images. Existing solutions are commonly composed of
several separate modules, some of which may not have been designed for the
specific structure and quality of light field data. This increases the
complexity of the codec and results in impractical decoding runtimes. We
propose a new learning-based, disparity-aided model for compression of 4D light
field images capable of parallel decoding. The model is end-to-end trainable,
eliminating the need for hand-tuning separate modules and allowing joint
learning of rate and distortion. The disparity-aided approach ensures the
structural integrity of the reconstructed light fields. Comparisons with the
state of the art show encouraging performance in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM
metrics. Also, there is a notable gain in the encoding and decoding runtimes.

                                        <span>We address the problem of universal domain adaptation (UDA) in ordinal
regression (OR), which attempts to solve classification problems in which
labels are not independent, but follow a natural order. We show that the UDA
techniques developed for classification and based on the clustering assumption,
under-perform in OR settings. We propose a method that complements the OR
classifier with an auxiliary task of order learning, which plays the double
role of discriminating between common and private instances, and expanding
class labels to the private target images via ranking. Combined with
adversarial domain discrimination, our model is able to address the closed set,
partial and open set configurations. We evaluate our method on three face age
estimation datasets, and show that it outperforms the baseline methods.</span>

in algorithms for the automatic generation of simulation ready electronic
circuits from hand-drawn circuits. However, most of the approaches in
literature were confined to classify different types of electrical components
and only a few of those methods have shown a way to rebuild the circuit
schematic from the scanned image, which is extremely important for further
automation of netlist generation. This paper proposes a real-time algorithm for
the automatic recognition of hand-drawn electrical circuits based on object
detection and circuit node recognition. The proposed approach employs You Only
Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) for detection of circuit components and a novel
Hough transform based approach for node recognition. Using YOLOv5 object
detection algorithm, a mean average precision (mAP0.5) of 98.2% is achieved in
detecting the components. The proposed method is also able to rebuild the
circuit schematic with 80% accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-label image classification (MLIC) is a fundamental and practical task,
which aims to assign multiple possible labels to an image. In recent years,
many deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been
proposed which model label correlations to discover semantics of labels and
learn semantic representations of images. This paper advances this research
direction by improving both the modeling of label correlations and the learning
of semantic representations. On the one hand, besides the local semantics of
each label, we propose to further explore global semantics shared by multiple
labels. On the other hand, existing approaches mainly learn the semantic
representations at the last convolutional layer of a CNN. But it has been noted
that the image representations of different layers of CNN capture different
levels or scales of features and have different discriminative abilities. We
thus propose to learn semantic representations at multiple convolutional
layers. To this end, this paper designs a Multi-layered Semantic Representation
Network (MSRN) which discovers both local and global semantics of labels
through modeling label correlations and utilizes the label semantics to guide
the semantic representations learning at multiple layers through an attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets including VOC 2007,
COCO, NUS-WIDE, and Apparel show a competitive performance of the proposed MSRN
against state-of-the-art models.</span>

tasks, including measurement of global human population, local economic

high-resolution imagery is both infrequently collected and expensive to

semi-supervised learning, which is a learning scheme in which the scarce labels

semi-supervised learning approaches. In particular, the methods in regard to
using deep neural networks in a semi-supervised learning setting are primarily

                                        <span>Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the
concept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an
unrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In
an attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open
set environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of
incremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial
trained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and
autonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some
problems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to
retrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy
as multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new
classes is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address
these problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold
approach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies
high by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources
used in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on
the idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when
exposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method
can be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network
architecture.</span>

                                        <span>Kernel segmentation aims at partitioning a data sequence into several
non-overlapping segments that may have nonlinear and complex structures. In
general, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial
constraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic
programming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements.
Given that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a
practical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to
approximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of
their solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate
the aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based
regularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining
it with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a
differentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization
(KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the
optimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed
model. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower
time and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform
segmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting
multiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to
further introduce an extended variant of the proposed model. Through extensive
experiments on various types of data sequences performances of our models are
evaluated and compared with those of the existing methods. The experimental
results validate advantages of the proposed models. Our Matlab source code is
available on github.</span>

gradient-descent to alternately optimize the supernet weights and the
architecture parameters through a bi-level optimization paradigm,
\textit{Differentiable ARchiTecture Search} (DARTS) has become the mainstream
method in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, more recent works found that the performance of the
searched architecture barely increases with the optimization proceeding in
DARTS. In addition, several concurrent works show that the NAS could find more
competitive architectures without labels. The above observations reveal that
the supervision signal in DARTS may be a poor indicator for architecture
optimization, inspiring a foundational question: instead of using the
supervision signal to perform bi-level optimization, \textit{can we find
high-quality architectures \textbf{without any training nor labels}}? We
provide an affirmative answer by customizing the NAS as a network pruning at
initialization problem. By leveraging recent techniques on the network pruning
at initialization, we designed a FreeFlow proxy to score the importance of
candidate operations in NAS without any training nor labels, and proposed a
novel framework called \textit{training and label free neural architecture
search} (\textbf{FreeNAS}) accordingly. We show that, without any training nor
labels, FreeNAS with the proposed FreeFlow proxy can outperform most NAS
baselines. More importantly, our framework is extremely efficient, which
completes the architecture search within only \textbf{3.6s} and \textbf{79s} on
a single GPU for the NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search space, respectively. We
hope our work inspires more attempts in solving NAS from the perspective of
pruning at initialization.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) problem. While
some recently proposed algorithms utilized variants of knowledge distillation
(KD) technique to tackle the problem, they only partially addressed the key
additional challenges in CISS that causes the catastrophic forgetting; i.e.,
the semantic drift of the background class and multi-label prediction issue. To
better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M
(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining
several techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we
make three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background
class to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone
network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling
to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny
exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and
stability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better
performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough and
extensive ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem
compared to the standard class-incremental learning for classification.</span>

related to computer vision. These applications will include face detection,
finding pornographic images in movies and photos, finding ethnicity, age,
diagnosis, and so on. Therefore, proposing a proper skin detection method can
provide solution to several problems. In this study, first a new color space is
created using FCM and PSO algorithms. Then, skin classification has been
performed in the new color space utilizing linear and nonlinear modes.
Additionally, it has been done in RGB and LAB color spaces by using ANFIS and
neural network. Skin detection in RBG color space has been performed using
Mahalanobis distance and Euclidean distance algorithms. In comparison, this
method has 18.38% higher accuracy than the most accurate method on the same
database. Additionally, this method has achieved 90.05% in equal error rate

Detecting moving objects can be posed as Moving Object Segmentation, by
segmenting the object pixels, or Moving Object Detection, by generating a
bounding box for the moving targets. In this paper, we present a Multi-Task
Learning architecture, based on Transformers, to jointly perform both tasks
through one network. Due to the importance of the motion features to the task,
the whole setup is based on a Spatio-Temporal aggregation. We evaluate the
performance of the individual tasks architecture versus the MTL setup, both
with early shared encoders, and late shared encoder-decoder transformers. For
the latter, we present a novel joint tasks query decoder transformer, that
enables us to have tasks dedicated heads out of the shared model. To evaluate
our approach, we use the KITTI MOD [29] data set. Results show1.5% mAP
improvement for Moving Object Detection, and 2%IoU improvement for Moving
Object Segmentation, over the individual tasks networks.</span>

cameras, or low-quality sensors, it becomes difficult for automated
identification systems to verify the identity due to image blur and distortion.
We propose a fingerprint deblurring model FDeblur-GAN, based on the conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and multi-stage framework of the stack
GAN. Additionally, we integrate two auxiliary sub-networks into the model for
the deblurring task. The first sub-network is a ridge extractor model. It is
added to generate ridge maps to ensure that fingerprint information and
minutiae are preserved in the deblurring process and prevent the model from
generating erroneous minutiae. The second sub-network is a verifier that helps
the generator to preserve the ID information during the generation process.
Using a database of blurred fingerprints and corresponding ridge maps, the deep
network learns to deblur from the input blurry samples. We evaluate the
proposed method in combination with two different fingerprint matching
algorithms. We achieved an accuracy of 95.18% on our fingerprint database for
the task of matching deblurred and ground truth fingerprints.</span>

the world. However, state-of-the-art techniques to detect the location of slum
areas employ high-resolution satellite imagery, which is costly to obtain and
process. As a result, researchers have started to look at utilising free and
open-access medium resolution satellite imagery. Yet, there is no clear
consensus on which data preparation and machine learning approaches are the
most appropriate to use with such imagery data. In this paper, we evaluate two
techniques (multi-spectral data and grey-level co-occurrence matrix feature
extraction) on an open-access dataset consisting of labelled Sentinel-2 images
with a spatial resolution of 10 meters. Both techniques were paired with a
canonical correlation forests classifier. The results show that the grey-level
co-occurrence matrix performed better than multi-spectral data for all four
cities. It had an average accuracy for the slum class of 97% and a mean
intersection over union of 94%, while multi-spectral data had 75% and 64% for
the respective metrics. These results indicate that open-access satellite
imagery with a resolution of at least 10 meters may be suitable for keeping

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation is used in many machine learning applications
where, during training, a model has access to unlabeled data in the target
domain, and a related labeled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel and
general domain-adversarial framework. Specifically, we derive a novel
generalization bound for domain adaptation that exploits a new measure of
discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of
f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al.
(2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based on
this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key
correction in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016).
We show that many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last
years in this framework are then not required to achieve performance comparable
to (if not better than) state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods.
Experimental analysis conducted on real-world natural language and computer
vision datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baselines, and
obtains the best results for f-divergences that were not considered previously
in domain-adversarial learning.</span>

                                        <span>Top-down attention allows neural networks, both artificial and biological, to
focus on the information most relevant for a given task. This is known to
enhance performance in visual perception. But it remains unclear how attention
brings about its perceptual boost, especially when it comes to naturalistic
settings like recognising an object in an everyday scene. What aspects of a
visual task does attention help to deal with? We aim to answer this with a
computational experiment based on a general framework called task-oriented
ablation design. First we define a broad range of visual tasks and identify six
factors that underlie task variability. Then on each task we compare the
performance of two neural networks, one with top-down attention and one
without. These comparisons reveal the task-dependence of attention&#x27;s perceptual
boost, giving a clearer idea of the role attention plays. Whereas many existing
cognitive accounts link attention to stimulus-level variables, such as visual
clutter and object scale, we find greater explanatory power in system-level
variables that capture the interaction between the model, the distribution of
training data and the task format. This finding suggests a shift in how
attention is studied could be fruitful. We make publicly available our code and
results, along with statistics relevant to ImageNet-based experiments beyond
this one. Our contribution serves to support the development of more human-like
vision models and the design of more informative machine-learning experiments.</span>

                                        <span>Place Recognition is a crucial capability for mobile robot localization and
navigation. Image-based or Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a challenging
problem as scene appearance and camera viewpoint can change significantly when
places are revisited. Recent VPR methods based on &#x60;&#x60;sequential
representations&#x27;&#x27; have shown promising results as compared to traditional
sequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to
these endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored
following the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However,
a key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation
always superior to an implicit &#x60;&#x60;spatial&#x27;&#x27; representation based on sequence of
RGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended
abstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a
similar &#x60;&#x60;metric span&#x27;&#x27; to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based
method (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and
showcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass,
the performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span.
These performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness
of input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot.
While a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two
different modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of
answering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to
several applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.

                                        <span>Coronary X-ray angiography is a crucial clinical procedure for the diagnosis
and treatment of coronary artery disease, which accounts for roughly 16% of
global deaths every year. However, the images acquired in these procedures have
low resolution and poor contrast, making lesion detection and assessment
challenging. Accurate coronary artery segmentation not only helps mitigate
these problems, but also allows the extraction of relevant anatomical features
for further analysis by quantitative methods. Although automated segmentation
of coronary arteries has been proposed before, previous approaches have used
non-optimal segmentation criteria, leading to less useful results. Most methods
either segment only the major vessel, discarding important information from the
remaining ones, or segment the whole coronary tree based mostly on contrast
information, producing a noisy output that includes vessels that are not
relevant for diagnosis. We adopt a better-suited clinical criterion and segment
vessels according to their clinical relevance. Additionally, we simultaneously
perform catheter segmentation, which may be useful for diagnosis due to the
scale factor provided by the catheter&#x27;s known diameter, and is a task that has
not yet been performed with good results. To derive the optimal approach, we
conducted an extensive comparative study of encoder-decoder architectures
trained on a combination of focal loss and a variant of generalized dice loss.
Based on the EfficientNet and the UNet++ architectures, we propose a line of
efficient and high-performance segmentation models using a new decoder
architecture, the EfficientUNet++, whose best-performing version achieved
average dice scores of 0.8904 and 0.7526 for the artery and catheter classes,
respectively, and an average generalized dice score of 0.9234.</span>

                                        <span>Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a crucial task for the Autonomous Driving
pipeline. MOD is usually handled via 2-stream convolutional architectures that
incorporates both appearance and motion cues, without considering the
inter-relations between the spatial or motion features. In this paper, we
tackle this problem through multi-head attention mechanisms, both across the
spatial and motion streams. We propose MODETR; a Moving Object DEtection
TRansformer network, comprised of multi-stream transformer encoders for both
spatial and motion modalities, and an object transformer decoder that produces
the moving objects bounding boxes using set predictions. The whole architecture
is trained end-to-end using bi-partite loss. Several methods of incorporating
motion cues with the Transformer model are explored, including two-stream RGB
and Optical Flow (OF) methods, and multi-stream architectures that take
advantage of sequence information. To incorporate the temporal information, we
propose a new Temporal Positional Encoding (TPE) approach to extend the Spatial
Positional Encoding(SPE) in DETR. We explore two architectural choices for
that, balancing between speed and time. To evaluate the our network, we perform
the MOD task on the KITTI MOD [6] data set. Results show significant 5% mAP of
the Transformer network for MOD over the state-of-the art methods. Moreover,
the proposed TPE encoding provides 10% mAP improvement over the SPE baseline.</span>

                                        <span>The advent of social media platforms has been a catalyst for the development
of digital photography that engendered a boom in vision applications. With this
motivation, we introduce a large-scale dataset termed &#x27;Photozilla&#x27;, which
includes over 990k images belonging to 10 different photographic styles. The
dataset is then used to train 3 classification models to automatically classify
the images into the relevant style which resulted in an accuracy of ~96%. With
the rapid evolution of digital photography, we have seen new types of
photography styles emerging at an exponential rate. On that account, we present
a novel Siamese-based network that uses the trained classification models as
the base architecture to adapt and classify unseen styles with only 25 training
samples. We report an accuracy of over 68% for identifying 10 other distinct
types of photography styles. This dataset can be found at

                                        <span>Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine
learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve
the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning
rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective
adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer
problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic
momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. At the
same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by
using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in
estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated
BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still
achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ without large
batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm
(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our
methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of
adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum
and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence
analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel
optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel
optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.</span>

                                        <span>Transfer learning with pre-training on large-scale datasets has played an
increasingly significant role in computer vision and natural language
processing recently. However, as there exist numerous application scenarios
that have distinctive demands such as certain latency constraints and
specialized data distributions, it is prohibitively expensive to take advantage
of large-scale pre-training for per-task requirements. In this paper, we focus
on the area of object detection and present a transfer learning system named
GAIA, which could automatically and efficiently give birth to customized
solutions according to heterogeneous downstream needs. GAIA is capable of
providing powerful pre-trained weights, selecting models that conform to
downstream demands such as latency constraints and specified data domains, and
collecting relevant data for practitioners who have very few datapoints for
their tasks. With GAIA, we achieve promising results on COCO, Objects365, Open
Images, Caltech, CityPersons, and UODB which is a collection of datasets
including KITTI, VOC, WiderFace, DOTA, Clipart, Comic, and more. Taking COCO as
an example, GAIA is able to efficiently produce models covering a wide range of
latency from 16ms to 53ms, and yields AP from 38.2 to 46.5 without whistles and
bells. To benefit every practitioner in the community of object detection, GAIA
is released at https://github.com/GAIA-vision.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate liver and lesion segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images
are highly demanded in clinical practice for assisting the diagnosis and
assessment of hepatic tumor disease. However, automatic liver and lesion
segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT volumes is extremely challenging due to
the diversity in contrast, resolution, and quality of images. Previous methods
based on UNet for 2D slice-by-slice or 3D volume-by-volume segmentation either
lack sufficient spatial contexts or suffer from high GPU computational cost,
which limits the performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
context-aware PolyUNet for accurate liver and lesion segmentation. It jointly
explores structural diversity and consecutive t-adjacent slices to enrich
feature expressive power and spatial contextual information while avoiding the
overload of GPU memory consumption. In addition, we utilize zoom out/in and
two-stage refinement strategy to exclude the irrelevant contexts and focus on
the specific region for the fine-grained segmentation. Our method achieved very
competitive performance at the MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS)
Challenge among all tasks with a single model and ranked the $3^{rd}$,
$12^{th}$, $2^{nd}$, and $5^{th}$ places in the liver segmentation, lesion
segmentation, lesion detection, and tumor burden estimation, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary
widely used in biomedical knowledge systems, particularly for semantic indexing
of scientific literature. As the MeSH hierarchy evolves through annual version
updates, some new descriptors are introduced that were not previously
available. This paper explores the conceptual provenance of these new
descriptors. In particular, we investigate whether such new descriptors have
been previously covered by older descriptors and what is their current relation
to them. To this end, we propose a framework to categorize new descriptors
based on their current relation to older descriptors. Based on the proposed
classification scheme, we quantify, analyse and present the different types of
new descriptors introduced in MeSH during the last fifteen years. The results
show that only about 25% of new MeSH descriptors correspond to new emerging
concepts, whereas the rest were previously covered by one or more existing
descriptors, either implicitly or explicitly. Most of them were covered by a
single existing descriptor and they usually end up as descendants of it in the
current hierarchy, gradually leading towards a more fine-grained MeSH
vocabulary. These insights about the dynamics of the thesaurus are useful for
the retrospective study of scientific articles annotated with MeSH, but could
also be used to inform the policy of updating the thesaurus in the future.</span>

                                        <span>The Turing Award is recognized as the most influential and prestigious award
in the field of computer science(CS). With the rise of the science of science
(SciSci), a large amount of bibliographic data has been analyzed in an attempt
to understand the hidden mechanism of scientific evolution. These include the
analysis of the Nobel Prize, including physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. In
this article, we extract and analyze the data of 72 Turing Award laureates from
the complete bibliographic data, fill the gap in the lack of Turing Award
analysis, and discover the development characteristics of computer science as
an independent discipline. First, we show most Turing Award laureates have
long-term and high-quality educational backgrounds, and more than 61% of them
have a degree in mathematics, which indicates that mathematics has played a
significant role in the development of computer science. Secondly, the data
shows that not all scholars have high productivity and high h-index; that is,
the number of publications and h-index is not the leading indicator for
evaluating the Turing Award. Third, the average age of awardees has increased
from 40 to around 70 in recent years. This may be because new breakthroughs
take longer, and some new technologies need time to prove their influence.
Besides, we have also found that in the past ten years, international
collaboration has experienced explosive growth, showing a new paradigm in the
form of collaboration. It is also worth noting that in recent years, the
emergence of female winners has also been eye-catching. Finally, by analyzing
the personal publication records, we find that many people are more likely to
publish high-impact articles during their high-yield periods.</span>

                                        <span>Due to high annotation costs making the best use of existing human-created
training data is an important research direction. We, therefore, carry out a
systematic evaluation of transferability of BERT-based neural ranking models
across five English datasets. Previous studies focused primarily on zero-shot
and few-shot transfer from a large dataset to a dataset with a small number of
queries. In contrast, each of our collections has a substantial number of
queries, which enables a full-shot evaluation mode and improves reliability of
our results. Furthermore, since source datasets licences often prohibit
commercial use, we compare transfer learning to training on pseudo-labels
generated by a BM25 scorer. We find that training on pseudo-labels -- possibly
with subsequent fine-tuning using a modest number of annotated queries -- can
produce a competitive or better model compared to transfer learning. Yet, it is
necessary to improve the stability and/or effectiveness of the few-shot
training, which, sometimes, can degrade performance of a pretrained model.</span>

                                        <span>Place Recognition is a crucial capability for mobile robot localization and
navigation. Image-based or Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a challenging
problem as scene appearance and camera viewpoint can change significantly when
places are revisited. Recent VPR methods based on &#x60;&#x60;sequential
representations&#x27;&#x27; have shown promising results as compared to traditional
sequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to
these endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored
following the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However,
a key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation
always superior to an implicit &#x60;&#x60;spatial&#x27;&#x27; representation based on sequence of
RGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended
abstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a
similar &#x60;&#x60;metric span&#x27;&#x27; to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based
method (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and
showcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass,
the performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span.
These performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness
of input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot.
While a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two
different modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of
answering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to
several applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.

to detect signals on dietary supplement-related adverse events (DS AEs) from
Twitter. Material and Methods: We obtained 247,807 tweets ranging from 2012 to
2018 that mentioned both DS and AE. We annotated biomedical entities and
relations on 2,000 randomly selected tweets. For the concept extraction task,
we compared the performance of traditional word embeddings with SVM, CRF and
LSTM-CRF classifiers to BERT models. For the relation extraction task, we
compared GloVe vectors with CNN classifiers to BERT models. We chose the best
performing models in each task to assemble an end-to-end deep learning pipeline
to detect DS AE signals and compared the results to the known DS AEs from a DS
knowledge base (i.e., iDISK). Results: In both tasks, the BERT-based models
outperformed traditional word embeddings. The best performing concept
extraction model is the BioBERT model that can identify supplement, symptom,
and body organ entities with F1-scores of 0.8646, 0.8497, and 0.7104,
respectively. The best performing relation extraction model is the BERT model
that can identify purpose and AE relations with F1-scores of 0.8335 and 0.7538,
respectively. The end-to-end pipeline was able to extract DS indication and DS
AEs with an F1-score of 0.7459 and 0,7414, respectively. Comparing to the
iDISK, we could find both known and novel DS-AEs. Conclusion: We have
demonstrated the feasibility of detecting DS AE signals from Twitter with a
BioBERT-based deep learning pipeline.</span>

                                        <span>Topic modeling is an unsupervised method for revealing the hidden semantic
structure of a corpus. It has been increasingly widely adopted as a tool in the
social sciences, including political science, digital humanities and
sociological research in general. One desirable property of topic models is to
allow users to find topics describing a specific aspect of the corpus. A
possible solution is to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into topic
modeling, but this requires a specification from domain experts. We propose a
novel query-driven topic model that allows users to specify a simple query in
words or phrases and return query-related topics, thus avoiding tedious work
from domain experts. Our proposed approach is particularly attractive when the
user-specified query has a low occurrence in a text corpus, making it difficult
for traditional topic models built on word cooccurrence patterns to identify
relevant topics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model in comparison with both classical topic models and neural topic models.</span>

question in computational social science. Traditional methods and datasets for
sentiment analysis are, however, not suitable for the domain of political text
as they do not consider the direction of sentiments expressed between entities.
In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task of identifying directed sentiment
relationship between political entities from a given news document, which we
call directed sentiment extraction. From a million-scale news corpus, we
construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political
entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for
utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting
multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate
the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by
analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two
major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. The newly proposed
problem, data, and method will facilitate future studies on interdisciplinary

                                        <span>Mathematical notation, i.e., the writing system used to communicate concepts
in mathematics, encodes valuable information for a variety of information
search and retrieval systems. Yet, mathematical notations remain mostly
unutilized by today&#x27;s systems. In this paper, we present the first in-depth
study on the distributions of mathematical notation in two large scientific
corpora: the open access arXiv (2.5B mathematical objects) and the mathematical
reviewing service for pure and applied mathematics zbMATH (61M mathematical
objects). Our study lays a foundation for future research projects on
mathematical information retrieval for large scientific corpora. Further, we
demonstrate the relevance of our results to a variety of use-cases. For
example, to assist semantic extraction systems, to improve scientific search
engines, and to facilitate specialized math recommendation systems. The
contributions of our presented research are as follows: (1) we present the
first distributional analysis of mathematical formulae on arXiv and zbMATH; (2)
we retrieve relevant mathematical objects for given textual search queries
(e.g., linking $P_{n}^{(\alpha, \beta)}\!\left(x\right)$ with &#x60;Jacobi
polynomial&#x27;); (3) we extend zbMATH&#x27;s search engine by providing relevant
mathematical formulae; and (4) we exemplify the applicability of the results by
presenting auto-completion for math inputs as the first contribution to math
recommendation systems. To expedite future research projects, we have made
available our source code and data.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of estimating a rank-one matrix from Gaussian
observations where different blocks of the matrix are observed under different
noise levels. This problem is motivated by applications in clustering and
community detection where latent variables can be partitioned into a fixed
number of known groups (e.g., users and items) and the blocks of the matrix
correspond to different types of pairwise interactions (e.g., user-user,
user-item, or item-item interactions). In the setting where the number of
blocks is fixed while the number of variables tends to infinity, we prove
asymptotically exact formulas for the minimum mean-squared error in estimating
both the matrix and the latent variables. These formulas describe the weak
recovery thresholds for the problem and reveal invariance properties with
respect to certain scalings of the noise variance. We also derive an
approximate message passing algorithm and a gradient descent algorithm and show
empirically that these algorithms achieve the information-theoretic limits in
certain regimes.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a new framework for unifying and systematizing the performance
analysis of first-order black-box optimization algorithms for unconstrained
convex minimization. The low-cost iteration complexity enjoyed by first-order
algorithms renders them particularly relevant for applications in machine
learning and large-scale data analysis. Relying on sum-of-squares (SOS)
optimization, we introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that give
increasingly better convergence bounds for higher levels of the hierarchy.
Alluding to the power of the SOS hierarchy, we show that the (dual of the)
first level corresponds to the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) introduced
by Drori and Teboulle [Math. Program., 145(1):451--482, 2014], a powerful
framework for determining convergence rates of first-order optimization
algorithms. Consequently, many results obtained within the PEP framework can be
reinterpreted as degree-1 SOS proofs, and thus, the SOS framework provides a
promising new approach for certifying improved rates of convergence by means of
higher-order SOS certificates. To determine analytical rate bounds, in this
work we use the first level of the SOS hierarchy and derive new result{s} for
noisy gradient descent with inexact line search methods (Armijo, Wolfe, and
Goldstein).</span>

using a contrastive predictive loss to extract slowly varying latent
representations. Rather than producing individual predictions for each of the
future representations, the model emits a sequence of predictions shorter than
that of the upcoming representations to which they will be aligned. In this
way, the prediction network solves a simpler task of predicting the next
symbols, but not their exact timing, while the encoding network is trained to
produce piece-wise constant latent codes. We evaluate the model on a speech
coding task and demonstrate that the proposed Aligned Contrastive Predictive
Coding (ACPC) leads to higher linear phone prediction accuracy and lower ABX
error rates, while being slightly faster to train due to the reduced number of
prediction heads.</span>

optimisation techniques, namely thermal annealing, Nelder-Mead, and gradient
descent. We begin with a direct study of the 2D Ising model on a quantum
annealer, and compare its properties directly with those of the thermal 2D
Ising model. These properties include an Ising-like phase transition that can
be induced by either a change in &#x27;quantum-ness&#x27; of the theory, or by a scaling
the Ising couplings up or down. This behaviour is in accord with what is
expected from the physical understanding of the quantum system. We then go on
to demonstrate the efficacy of the quantum annealer at minimising several
increasingly hard two dimensional potentials. For all the potentials we find
the general behaviour that Nelder-Mead and gradient descent methods are very
susceptible to becoming trapped in false minima, while the thermal anneal
method is somewhat better at discovering the true minimum. However, and despite
current limitations on its size, the quantum annealer performs a minimisation
very markedly better than any of these classical techniques. A quantum anneal
can be designed so that the system almost never gets trapped in a false
minimum, and rapidly and successfully minimises the potentials.</span>

together with those created by human artists. These artworks are mainly based
on generative deep learning techniques. Also given their success, several legal
problems arise when working with these techniques.

In this article we consider a set of key questions in the area of generative
deep learning for the arts. Is it possible to use copyrighted works as training
set for generative models? How do we legally store their copies in order to
perform the training process? And then, who (if someone) will own the copyright
on the generated data? We try to answer these questions considering the law in

helps fulfill such potential by challenging the contestants to detect hateful

utilize multi-modal, pre-trained models VilBERT and Visual BERT. We improved
models&#x27; performance by adding training datasets generated from data
augmentation. Enlarging the training data set helped us get a more than 2%

                                        <span>At present, people usually use some methods based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for Electroencephalograph (EEG) decoding. However, CNNs have
limitations in perceiving global dependencies, which is not adequate for common
EEG paradigms with a strong overall relationship. Regarding this issue, we
propose a novel EEG decoding method that mainly relies on the attention
mechanism. The EEG data is firstly preprocessed and spatially filtered. And
then, we apply attention transforming on the feature-channel dimension so that
the model can enhance more relevant spatial features. The most crucial step is
to slice the data in the time dimension for attention transforming, and finally
obtain a highly distinguishable representation. At this time, global averaging
pooling and a simple fully-connected layer are used to classify different
categories of EEG data. Experiments on two public datasets indicate that the
strategy of attention transforming effectively utilizes spatial and temporal
features. And we have reached the level of the state-of-the-art in
multi-classification of EEG, with fewer parameters. As far as we know, it is
the first time that a detailed and complete method based on the transformer
idea has been proposed in this field. It has good potential to promote the
practicality of brain-computer interface (BCI). The source code can be found

                                        <span>Neuromorphic neural network processors, in the form of compute-in-memory
crossbar arrays of memristors, or in the form of subthreshold analog and
mixed-signal ASICs, promise enormous advantages in compute density and energy
efficiency for NN-based ML tasks. However, these technologies are prone to
computational non-idealities, due to process variation and intrinsic device
physics. This degrades the task performance of networks deployed to the
processor, by introducing parameter noise into the deployed model. While it is
possible to calibrate each device, or train networks individually for each
processor, these approaches are expensive and impractical for commercial
deployment. Alternative methods are therefore needed to train networks that are
inherently robust against parameter variation, as a consequence of network
architecture and parameters. We present a new adversarial network optimisation
algorithm that attacks network parameters during training, and promotes robust
performance during inference in the face of parameter variation. Our approach
introduces a regularization term penalising the susceptibility of a network to
weight perturbation. We compare against previous approaches for producing
parameter insensitivity such as dropout, weight smoothing and introducing
parameter noise during training. We show that our approach produces models that
are more robust to targeted parameter variation, and equally robust to random
parameter variation. Our approach finds minima in flatter locations in the
weight-loss landscape compared with other approaches, highlighting that the
networks found by our technique are less sensitive to parameter perturbation.
Our work provides an approach to deploy neural network architectures to
inference devices that suffer from computational non-idealities, with minimal
loss of performance. ...</span>

                                        <span>Constrained clustering has gained significant attention in the field of
machine learning as it can leverage prior information on a growing amount of
only partially labeled data. Following recent advances in deep generative
models, we propose a novel framework for constrained clustering that is
intuitive, interpretable, and can be trained efficiently in the framework of
stochastic gradient variational inference. By explicitly integrating domain
knowledge in the form of probabilistic relations, our proposed model (DC-GMM)
uncovers the underlying distribution of data conditioned on prior clustering
preferences, expressed as pairwise constraints. These constraints guide the
clustering process towards a desirable partition of the data by indicating
which samples should or should not belong to the same cluster. We provide
extensive experiments to demonstrate that DC-GMM shows superior clustering
performances and robustness compared to state-of-the-art deep constrained
clustering methods on a wide range of data sets. We further demonstrate the
usefulness of our approach on two challenging real-world applications.</span>

                                        <span>Background: Colonoscopy remains the gold-standard screening for colorectal
cancer. However, significant miss rates for polyps have been reported,
particularly when there are multiple small adenomas. This presents an
opportunity to leverage computer-aided systems to support clinicians and reduce
the number of polyps missed.

Method: In this work we introduce the Focus U-Net, a novel dual
attention-gated deep neural network, which combines efficient spatial and
channel-based attention into a single Focus Gate module to encourage selective
learning of polyp features. The Focus U-Net further incorporates short-range
skip connections and deep supervision. Furthermore, we introduce the Hybrid
Focal loss, a new compound loss function based on the Focal loss and Focal
Tversky loss, to handle class-imbalanced image segmentation. For our
experiments, we selected five public datasets containing images of polyps
obtained during optical colonoscopy: CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB,
ETIS-Larib PolypDB and EndoScene test set. To evaluate model performance, we
use the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU)
metrics.

Results: Our model achieves state-of-the-art results for both CVC-ClinicDB
and Kvasir-SEG, with a mean DSC of 0.941 and 0.910, respectively. When
evaluated on a combination of five public polyp datasets, our model similarly
achieves state-of-the-art results with a mean DSC of 0.878 and mean IoU of
0.809, a 14% and 15% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results of
0.768 and 0.702, respectively.

Conclusions: This study shows the potential for deep learning to provide fast
and accurate polyp segmentation results for use during colonoscopy. The Focus
U-Net may be adapted for future use in newer non-invasive screening and more
broadly to other biomedical image segmentation tasks involving class imbalance
and requiring efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retraining. Our key innovation is to
redefine the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration
of network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between
pruning and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves minimal loss of SNNs&#x27; performance on MNIST and
CIFAR-10 dataset so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under
unprecedented 0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining
capability in SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high
redundancy in deep SNNs. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>The difficulty in specifying rewards for many real-world problems has led to
an increased focus on learning rewards from human feedback, such as
demonstrations. However, there are often many different reward functions that
explain the human feedback, leaving agents with uncertainty over what the true
reward function is. While most policy optimization approaches handle this
uncertainty by optimizing for expected performance, many applications demand
risk-averse behavior. We derive a novel policy gradient-style robust
optimization approach, PG-BROIL, that optimizes a soft-robust objective that
balances expected performance and risk. To the best of our knowledge, PG-BROIL
is the first policy optimization algorithm robust to a distribution of reward
hypotheses which can scale to continuous MDPs. Results suggest that PG-BROIL
can produce a family of behaviors ranging from risk-neutral to risk-averse and
outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms when learning from
ambiguous demonstrations by hedging against uncertainty, rather than seeking to
uniquely identify the demonstrator&#x27;s reward function.</span>

the form of images has increased drastically. As personal life is being
continuously documented in pictures, the risk of losing it to eavesdroppers is
a matter of grave concern. Secondary storage is the most preferred medium for
the storage of personal and other images. Our work is concerned with the
security of such images. While encryption is the best way to ensure image
security, full encryption and decryption is a computationally-intensive
process. Moreover, as cameras are getting better every day, image quality, and
thus, the pixel density has increased considerably. The increased pixel density
makes encryption and decryption more expensive. We, therefore, delve into
selective encryption and selective blurring based on the region of interest.
Instead of encrypting or blurring the entire photograph, we only encode
selected regions of the image. We present a comparative analysis of the partial
and full encryption of the photos. This kind of encoding will help us lower the
encryption overhead without compromising security. The applications utilizing
this technique will become more usable due to the reduction in the decryption
time. Additionally, blurred images being more readable than encrypted ones,
allowed us to define the level of security. We leverage the machine learning
algorithms like Mask-RCNN (Region-based convolutional neural network) and YOLO

                                        <span>Modeling dynamical systems plays a crucial role in capturing and
understanding complex physical phenomena. When physical models are not
sufficiently accurate or hardly describable by analytical formulas, one can use
generic function approximators such as neural networks to capture the system
dynamics directly from sensor measurements. As for now, current methods to
learn the parameters of these neural networks are highly sensitive to the
inherent instability of most dynamical systems of interest, which in turn
prevents the study of very long sequences. In this work, we introduce a generic
and scalable method based on multiple shooting to learn latent representations
of indirectly observed dynamical systems. We achieve state-of-the-art
performances on systems observed directly from raw images. Further, we
demonstrate that our method is robust to noisy measurements and can handle
complex dynamical systems, such as chaotic ones.</span>

                                        <span>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a recently proposed neural
architecture search (NAS) method based on a differentiable relaxation. Due to
its success, numerous variants analyzing and improving parts of the DARTS
framework have recently been proposed. By considering the problem as a
constrained bilevel optimization, we propose and analyze three improvements to
architectural weight competition, update scheduling, and regularization towards
discretization. First, we introduce a new approach to the activation of
architecture weights, which prevents confounding competition within an edge and
allows for fair comparison across edges to aid in discretization. Next, we
propose a dynamic schedule based on per-minibatch network information to make
architecture updates more informed. Finally, we consider two regularizations,
based on proximity to discretization and the Alternating Directions Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, to promote early discretization. Our results show
that this new activation scheme reduces final architecture size and the
regularizations improve reliability in search results while maintaining
comparable performance to state-of-the-art in NAS, especially when used with
our new dynamic informed schedule.</span>

scenario, data augmentation can be used not only to expand the number of images

started requiring interpretable models for safety-critical domains.
Concept-based neural networks have arisen as explainable-by-design methods as
they leverage human-understandable symbols (i.e. concepts) to predict class
memberships. However, most of these approaches focus on the identification of
the most relevant concepts but do not provide concise, formal explanations of
how such concepts are leveraged by the classifier to make predictions. In this
paper, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable approach enabling the
extraction of logic explanations from neural networks using the formalism of
First-Order Logic. The method relies on an entropy-based criterion which
automatically identifies the most relevant concepts. We consider four different
case studies to demonstrate that: (i) this entropy-based criterion enables the
distillation of concise logic explanations in safety-critical domains from
clinical data to computer vision; (ii) the proposed approach outperforms

adequate medical attention and support, which in many cases is life-saving.
Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from a given piece of text, if an
individual is suicidal or clinically healthy. However, there have been no major
attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is an
important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data,
suicide notes, or other similar verified sources, web query data has emerged as
a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity
that prompts honest disclosure of symptoms, making it a plausible source even
in a clinical setting. However, these online datasets also result in lower
performance, which can be attributed to the inherent noise in web-scraped
labels, which necessitates a noise-removal process. Thus, we propose SDCNL, a
suicide versus depression classification method through a deep learning
approach. We utilize online content from Reddit to train our algorithm, and to
verify and correct noisy labels, we propose a novel unsupervised label
correction method which, unlike previous work, does not require prior noise
distribution information. Our extensive experimentation with multiple deep word
embedding models and classifiers display the strong performance of the method
in anew, challenging classification application. We make our code and dataset

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted
great interest due to its tremendous potentials in learning discriminative
representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes,
existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency,
e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for
comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we discover two contradictory
phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and
over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency.
Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the
dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for
contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object
categories. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn the
feature representation from excessive negative sample pairs, which enforces the
model to over-cluster samples of the same actual categories into different
clusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel
self-supervised learning framework using a median triplet loss. Precisely, we
employ a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the
positive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and
we construct the negative pair by selecting the negative sample of a median
similarity score from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering
problem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively
evaluate our proposed framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g.,
ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results demonstrate the superior performance
(e.g., the learning efficiency) of our model over the latest state-of-the-art
methods by a clear margin. Codes available at:

                                        <span>Optimization problems are ubiquitous in our societies and are present in
almost every segment of the economy. Most of these optimization problems are
NP-hard and computationally demanding, often requiring approximate solutions
for large-scale instances. Machine learning frameworks that learn to
approximate solutions to such hard optimization problems are a potentially
promising avenue to address these difficulties, particularly when many closely
related problem instances must be solved repeatedly. Supervised learning
frameworks can train a model using the outputs of pre-solved instances.
However, when the outputs are themselves approximations, when the optimization
problem has symmetric solutions, and/or when the solver uses randomization,
solutions to closely related instances may exhibit large differences and the
learning task can become inherently more difficult. This paper demonstrates
this critical challenge, connects the volatility of the training data to the
ability of a model to approximate it, and proposes a method for producing
(exact or approximate) solutions to optimization problems that are more
amenable to supervised learning tasks. The effectiveness of the method is
tested on hard non-linear nonconvex and discrete combinatorial problems.</span>

                                        <span>Context: Software engineering researchers have undertaken many experiments
investigating the potential of software defect prediction algorithms.
Unfortunately, some widely used performance metrics are known to be
problematic, most notably F1, but nevertheless F1 is widely used.

Objective: To investigate the potential impact of using F1 on the validity of
this large body of research.

Method: We undertook a systematic review to locate relevant experiments and
then extract all pairwise comparisons of defect prediction performance using F1
and the un-biased Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).

Results: We found a total of 38 primary studies. These contain 12,471 pairs
of results. Of these, 21.95% changed direction when the MCC metric is used
instead of the biased F1 metric. Unfortunately, we also found evidence
suggesting that F1 remains widely used in software defect prediction research.

Conclusions: We reiterate the concerns of statisticians that the F1 is a
problematic metric outside of an information retrieval context, since we are
concerned about both classes (defect-prone and not defect-prone units). This
inappropriate usage has led to a substantial number (more than one fifth) of
erroneous (in terms of direction) results. Therefore we urge researchers to (i)
use an unbiased metric and (ii) publish detailed results including confusion
matrices such that alternative analyses become possible.</span>

continuous multimodal mobile sensing data towards relapse prediction tasks. The
identified clusters could represent different routine behavioral trends related
to daily living of patients as well as atypical behavioral trends associated
with impending relapse.

We used the mobile sensing data obtained in the CrossCheck project for our
analysis. Continuous data from six different mobile sensing-based modalities
(e.g. ambient light, sound/conversation, acceleration etc.) obtained from a
total of 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to a year, were used
for the clustering models and relapse prediction evaluation. Two clustering
models, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Partition Around Medoids (PAM), were
used to obtain behavioral representations from the mobile sensing data. The
features obtained from the clustering models were used to train and evaluate a
personalized relapse prediction model using Balanced Random Forest. The
personalization was done by identifying optimal features for a given patient
based on a personalization subset consisting of other patients who are of
similar age.

The clusters identified using the GMM and PAM models were found to represent
different behavioral patterns (such as clusters representing sedentary days,
active but with low communications days, etc.). Significant changes near the
relapse periods were seen in the obtained behavioral representation features
from the clustering models. The clustering model based features, together with
other features characterizing the mobile sensing data, resulted in an F2 score
of 0.24 for the relapse prediction task in a leave-one-patient-out evaluation
setting. This obtained F2 score is significantly higher than a random
classification baseline with an average F2 score of 0.042.</span>

Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level

                                        <span>Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the
concept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an
unrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In
an attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open
set environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of
incremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial
trained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and
autonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some
problems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to
retrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy
as multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new
classes is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address
these problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold
approach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies
high by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources
used in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on
the idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when
exposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method
can be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network
architecture.</span>

                                        <span>There have been many recent advances on provably efficient Reinforcement
Learning (RL) in problems with rich observation spaces. However, all these
works share a strong realizability assumption about the optimal value function
of the true MDP. Such realizability assumptions are often too strong to hold in
practice. In this work, we consider the more realistic setting of agnostic RL
with rich observation spaces and a fixed class of policies $\Pi$ that may not
contain any near-optimal policy. We provide an algorithm for this setting whose
error is bounded in terms of the rank $d$ of the underlying MDP. Specifically,
our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}\left((H^{4d}
K^{3d} \log |\Pi|)/\epsilon^2\right)$ where $H$ is the length of episodes, $K$
is the number of actions and $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the desired sub-optimality. We
also provide a nearly matching lower bound for this agnostic setting that shows
that the exponential dependence on rank is unavoidable, without further
assumptions.</span>

devices, people are increasingly reliant on a variety of OSNs for keeping in
touch with family and friends, and using it as a source of information. For
example, a user might utilise multiple OSNs for different purposes, such as
using Flickr to share holiday pictures with family and friends, and Twitter to
post short messages about their thoughts. Identifying the same user across
multiple OSNs is an important task as this allows us to understand the usage
patterns of users among different OSNs, make recommendations when a user
registers for a new OSN, and various other useful applications. To address this
problem, we proposed an algorithm based on the multilayer perceptron using
various types of features, namely: (i) user profile, such as name, location,
description; (ii) temporal distribution of user generated content; and (iii)
embedding based on user name, real name and description. Using a Twitter and
Flickr dataset of users and their posting activities, we perform an empirical
study on how these features affect the performance of user identification
across the two OSNs and discuss our main findings based on the different
features.</span>

to significantly improve model performance. Typically data augmentation
simulates realistic variations in data in order to increase the apparent
diversity of the training-set. However, for opcode-based malware analysis,
where deep learning methods are already achieving state of the art performance,
it is not immediately clear how to apply data augmentation. In this paper we
study different methods of data augmentation starting with basic methods using
fixed transformations and moving to methods that adapt to the data. We propose
a novel data augmentation method based on using an opcode embedding layer
within the network and its corresponding opcode embedding matrix to perform
adaptive data augmentation during training. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first paper to carry out a systematic study of different augmentation
methods applied to opcode sequence based malware classification.</span>

known transition, and show that the minimax regret is
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{DT^\star K})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{DT^\star SA K})$
for the full-information setting and the bandit feedback setting respectively,
where $D$ is the diameter, $T^\star$ is the expected hitting time of the
optimal policy, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and
$K$ is the number of episodes. Our results significantly improve upon the
existing work of (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2020) which only considers the
full-information setting and achieves suboptimal regret. Our work is also the
first to consider bandit feedback with adversarial costs.

Our algorithms are built on top of the Online Mirror Descent framework with a
variety of new techniques that might be of independent interest, including an
improved multi-scale expert algorithm, a reduction from general stochastic
shortest path to a special loop-free case, a skewed occupancy measure space,
and a novel correction term added to the cost estimators. Interestingly, the
last two elements reduce the variance of the learner via positive bias and the
variance of the optimal policy via negative bias respectively, and having them
simultaneously is critical for obtaining the optimal high-probability bound in
the bandit feedback setting.</span>

Active Learning has focused on BALD, which reduces model parameter uncertainty.
However, we show that BALD gets stuck on out-of-distribution or junk data that
is not relevant for the task. We examine a novel *Expected Predictive
Information Gain (EPIG)* to deal with distribution shifts of the pool set. EPIG
reduces the uncertainty of *predictions* on an unlabelled *evaluation set*
sampled from the test data distribution whose distribution might be different
to the pool set distribution. Based on this, our new EPIG-BALD acquisition
function for Bayesian Neural Networks selects samples to improve the
performance on the test data distribution instead of selecting samples that
reduce model uncertainty everywhere, including for out-of-distribution regions
with low density in the test data distribution. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art Bayesian active learning methods on high-dimensional datasets
and avoids out-of-distribution junk data in cases where current
state-of-the-art methods fail.</span>

for capsules in successive layers, but the intra-relation between capsules in
the same layer is less studied, while this intra-relation is a key factor for
the semantic understanding in text data. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce
a new capsule network with graph routing to learn both relationships, where
capsules in each layer are treated as the nodes of a graph. We investigate
strategies to yield adjacency and degree matrix with three different distances
from a layer of capsules, and propose the graph routing mechanism between those
capsules. We validate our approach on five text classification datasets, and
our findings suggest that the approach combining bottom-up routing and top-down
attention performs the best. Such an approach demonstrates generalization
capability across datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art routing methods,
the improvements in accuracy in the five datasets we used were 0.82, 0.39,

the standard stochastic multi-armed bandit framework to a decentralized

$\mathcal{O}(\log(T)^2)$ regret when there are no assumptions on the

$i$ in a $T$-round $d$-expert problem where $\ell_{t,i}$ is the loss for expert
$i$ in round $t$. Our algorithm is based on the Mirror Descent framework with a
correction term and a weighted entropy regularizer. While natural, the
algorithm has not been studied before and requires a careful analysis. We also
generalize the bound to $O\left(\sqrt{(\ln d)\sum_t
(\ell_{t,i}-m_{t,i})^2}\right)$ for any prediction vector $m_t$ that the
learner receives, and recover or improve many existing results by choosing
different $m_t$. Furthermore, we use the same framework to create a master
algorithm that combines a set of base algorithms and learns the best one with
little overhead. The new guarantee of our master allows us to derive many new
results for both the expert problem and more generally Online Linear
Optimization.</span>

given to a discriminator which tells whether the generated image is correct or
not. We evaluate our network on 3 different datasets: MNIST, LSUN and CelebA

                                        <span>Electronic health records represent a holistic overview of patients&#x27;
trajectories. Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage
them and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases.
Given the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes,
deep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a
key limitation of these models remains their capacity in processing long
sequences. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to
lead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for
decades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field
of the existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing
crucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a
hierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the
receptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer
sequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal electronic health
records, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art BEHRT 1% to 5% for area
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 3% to 6% for area
under the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 3% to 6% (AUROC) and
3% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart
failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction.
Additionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not
well-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training
strategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting
clinical events with relatively small training dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Recently demonstrated physical-world adversarial attacks have exposed
vulnerabilities in perception systems that pose severe risks for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. These attacks place
adversarial artifacts in the physical world that indirectly cause the addition
of a universal patch to inputs of a model that can fool it in a variety of
contexts. Adversarial training is the most effective defense against
image-dependent adversarial attacks. However, tailoring adversarial training to
universal patches is computationally expensive since the optimal universal
patch depends on the model weights which change during training. We propose
meta adversarial training (MAT), a novel combination of adversarial training
with meta-learning, which overcomes this challenge by meta-learning universal
patches along with model training. MAT requires little extra computation while
continuously adapting a large set of patches to the current model. MAT
considerably increases robustness against universal patch attacks on image
classification and traffic-light detection.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear
Models (GLM) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model.
Different from its classical setting, our model allows the server to access
some additional public but unlabeled data. By using Stein&#x27;s lemma and its
variants, we first show that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm
for GLM (under some mild assumptions), if each data record is i.i.d sampled
from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\ell_1$-norm. Then with high
probability, the sample complexity of the public and private data, for the
algorithm to achieve an $\alpha$ estimation error (in $\ell_\infty$-norm), is
$O(p^2\alpha^{-2})$ and ${O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$, respectively, if
$\alpha$ is not too small ({\em i.e.,} $\alpha\geq
\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$), where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data. This
is a significant improvement over the previously known quasi-polynomial (in
$\alpha$) or exponential (in $p$) complexity of GLM with no public data. Also,
our algorithm can answer multiple (at most $\exp(O(p))$) GLM queries with the
same sample complexities as in the one GLM query case with at least constant
probability. We then extend our idea to the non-linear regression problem and
show a similar phenomenon for it. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets.
To our best knowledge, this is the first paper showing the existence of
efficient and effective algorithms for GLM and non-linear regression in the
NLDP model with public unlabeled data.</span>

                                        <span>Optimization problems on the generalized Stiefel manifold (and products of
it) are prevalent across science and engineering. For example, in computational
science they arise in the symmetric (generalized) eigenvalue problem, in
nonlinear eigenvalue problems, and in electronic structures computations, to
name a few problems. In statistics and machine learning, they arise, for
example, in various dimensionality reduction techniques such as canonical
correlation analysis. In deep learning, regularization and improved stability
can be obtained by constraining some layers to have parameter matrices that
belong to the Stiefel manifold. Solving problems on the generalized Stiefel
manifold can be approached via the tools of Riemannian optimization. However,
using the standard geometric components for the generalized Stiefel manifold
has two possible shortcoming: computing some of the geometric components can be
too expensive and converge can be rather slow in certain cases. Both
shortcomings can be addressed using a technique called Riemannian
preconditioning, which amounts to using geometric components derived using a
precoditioner that defines a Riemannian metric on the constraint manifold. In
this paper we develop the geometric components required to perform Riemannian
optimization on the generalized Stiefel manifold equipped with a non-standard
metric, and illustrate theoretically and numerically the use of those
components and the effect of Riemannian preconditioning for solving

                                        <span>The necessity of deep learning for tabular data is still an unanswered
question addressed by a large number of research efforts. The recent literature
on tabular DL proposes several deep architectures reported to be superior to
traditional &quot;shallow&quot; models like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. However,
since existing works often use different benchmarks and tuning protocols, it is
unclear if the proposed models universally outperform GBDT. Moreover, the
models are often not compared to each other, therefore, it is challenging to
identify the best deep model for practitioners.

In this work, we start from a thorough review of the main families of DL
models recently developed for tabular data. We carefully tune and evaluate them
on a wide range of datasets and reveal two significant findings. First, we show
that the choice between GBDT and DL models highly depends on data and there is
still no universally superior solution. Second, we demonstrate that a simple
ResNet-like architecture is a surprisingly effective baseline, which
outperforms most of the sophisticated models from the DL literature. Finally,
we design a simple adaptation of the Transformer architecture for tabular data
that becomes a new strong DL baseline and reduces the gap between GBDT and DL
models on datasets where GBDT dominates.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning and data-driven approaches have shown great potential in
scientific domains. The promise of data-driven techniques relies on the
availability of a large volume of high-quality training datasets. Due to the
high cost of obtaining data through expensive physical experiments,
instruments, and simulations, data augmentation techniques for scientific
applications have emerged as a new direction for obtaining scientific data
recently. However, existing data augmentation techniques originating from
computer vision, yield physically unacceptable data samples that are not
helpful for the domain problems that we are interested in. In this paper, we
develop new physics-informed data augmentation techniques based on
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, our generative models leverage
different physics knowledge (such as governing equations, observable
perception, and physics phenomena) to improve the quality of the synthetic
data. To validate the effectiveness of our data augmentation techniques, we
apply them to solve a subsurface seismic full-waveform inversion using
simulated CO$_2$ leakage data. Our interest is to invert for subsurface
velocity models associated with very small CO$_2$ leakage. We validate the
performance of our methods using comprehensive numerical tests. Via comparison
and analysis, we show that data-driven seismic imaging can be significantly
enhanced by using our physics-informed data augmentation techniques.
Particularly, the imaging quality has been improved by 15% in test scenarios of
general-sized leakage and 17% in small-sized leakage when using an augmented
training set obtained with our techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Agents that learn to select optimal actions represent a prominent focus of
the sequential decision-making literature. In the face of a complex environment
or constraints on time and resources, however, aiming to synthesize such an
optimal policy can become infeasible. These scenarios give rise to an important
trade-off between the information an agent must acquire to learn and the
sub-optimality of the resulting policy. While an agent designer has a
preference for how this trade-off is resolved, existing approaches further
require that the designer translate these preferences into a fixed learning
target for the agent. In this work, leveraging rate-distortion theory, we
automate this process such that the designer need only express their
preferences via a single hyperparameter and the agent is endowed with the
ability to compute its own learning targets that best achieve the desired
trade-off. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret for an
agent that decides what to learn in this manner along with computational
experiments that illustrate the expressiveness of designer preferences and even
show improvements over Thompson sampling in identifying an optimal policy.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning aims to transfer information from one task to enable
generalization on novel tasks given a few examples. This information is present
both in the domain and the class labels. In this work we investigate the
complementary roles of these two sources of information by combining
instance-discriminative contrastive learning and supervised learning in a
single framework called Supervised Momentum Contrastive learning (SUPMOCO). Our
approach avoids a problem observed in supervised learning where information in
images not relevant to the task is discarded, which hampers their
generalization to novel tasks. We show that (self-supervised) contrastive
learning and supervised learning are mutually beneficial, leading to a new
state-of-the-art on the META-DATASET - a recently introduced benchmark for
few-shot learning. Our method is based on a simple modification of MOCO and
scales better than prior work on combining supervised and self-supervised
learning. This allows us to easily combine data from multiple domains leading
to further improvements.</span>

estimation, especially for huge data sets and online learning. While this
recursive algorithm is popular for computation and memory efficiency,
quantifying variability and randomness of the solutions has been rarely
studied. This paper aims at conducting statistical inference of SGD-based
estimates in an online setting. In particular, we propose a fully online
estimator for the covariance matrix of averaged SGD iterates (ASGD) only using
the iterates from SGD. We formally establish our online estimator&#x27;s consistency
and show that the convergence rate is comparable to offline counterparts. Based
on the classic asymptotic normality results of ASGD, we construct
asymptotically valid confidence intervals for model parameters. Upon receiving
new observations, we can quickly update the covariance matrix estimate and the
confidence intervals. This approach fits in an online setting and takes full
advantage of SGD: efficiency in computation and memory.</span>

adversarial attacks, which are implemented by adding crafted perturbations onto
benign examples. Min-max robust optimization based adversarial training can
provide a notion of security against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial
robustness requires a significantly larger capacity of the network than that
for the natural training with only benign examples. This paper proposes a
framework of concurrent adversarial training and weight pruning that enables
model compression while still preserving the adversarial robustness and
essentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training. Furthermore, this work
studies two hypotheses about weight pruning in the conventional setting and
finds that weight pruning is essential for reducing the network model size in
the adversarial setting, training a small model from scratch even with
inherited initialization from the large model cannot achieve both adversarial
robustness and high standard accuracy. Code is available at

descent and its variants enjoy near-optimal regret bounds and convergence
rates, but suffer from a computational bottleneck of computing &quot;projections&#x27;&#x27;
in potentially each iteration (e.g., $O(T^{1/2})$ regret of online mirror
descent). On the other hand, conditional gradient variants solve a linear
optimization in each iteration, but result in suboptimal rates (e.g.,
$O(T^{3/4})$ regret of online Frank-Wolfe). Motivated by this trade-off in
runtime v/s convergence rates, we consider iterative projections of close-by
points over widely-prevalent submodular base polytopes $B(f)$. We develop a
toolkit to speed up the computation of projections using both discrete and
continuous perspectives. We subsequently adapt the away-step Frank-Wolfe
algorithm to use this information and enable early termination. For the special
case of cardinality based submodular polytopes, we improve the runtime of
computing certain Bregman projections by a factor of $\Omega(n/\log(n))$. Our
theoretical results show orders of magnitude reduction in runtime in
preliminary computational experiments.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed for semi-supervised node
classification on graphs where only a small subset of nodes have class labels.
However, under extreme cases when very few labels are available (e.g., 1
labeled node per class), GNNs suffer from severe result quality degradation.
Several existing studies make an initial effort to ease this situation, but are
still far from satisfactory.

In this paper, on few-labeled graph data, we propose an effective framework
ABN that is readily applicable to both shallow and deep GNN architectures and
significantly boosts classification accuracy. In particular, on a benchmark
dataset Cora with only 1 labeled node per class, while the classic graph
convolutional network (GCN) only has 44.6% accuracy, an immediate instantiation
of ABN over GCN achieves 62.5% accuracy; when applied to a deep architecture
DAGNN, ABN improves accuracy from 59.8% to 66.4%, which is state of the art.

ABN obtains superior performance through three main algorithmic designs.
First, it selects high-quality unlabeled nodes via an adaptive pseudo labeling
technique, so as to adaptively enhance the training process of GNNs. Second,
ABN balances the labels of the selected nodes on real-world skewed graph data
by pseudo label balancing. Finally, a negative sampling regularizer is designed
for ABN to further utilize the unlabeled nodes. The effectiveness of the three
techniques in ABN is well-validated by both theoretical and empirical analysis.
Extensive experiments, comparing 12 existing approaches on 4 benchmark
datasets, demonstrate that ABN achieves state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we extend standard neural networks by building upon an
assumption that neuronal activations correspond to the angle of a complex
number lying on the unit circle, or &#x27;phasor.&#x27; Each layer in such a network
produces new activations by taking a weighted superposition of the previous
layer&#x27;s phases and calculating the new phase value. This generalized
architecture allows models to reach high accuracy and carries the singular
advantage that mathematically equivalent versions of the network can be
executed with or without regard to a temporal variable. Importantly, the value
of a phase angle in the temporal domain can be sparsely represented by a
periodically repeating series of delta functions or &#x27;spikes&#x27;. We demonstrate
the atemporal training of a phasor network on standard deep learning tasks and
show that these networks can then be executed in either the traditional
atemporal domain or spiking temporal domain with no conversion step needed.
This provides a novel basis for constructing deep networkswhich operate via
temporal, spike-based calculations suitable for neuromorphic computing
hardware.</span>

neural networks (GNNs) gain much attention. The eye does not bring these two
essential tasks together yet. Imagine an adversary can utilize the powerful
GNNs to infer users&#x27; private labels in a social network. How can we
adversarially defend against such privacy attacks while maintaining the utility
of perturbed graphs? In this work, we propose a novel research task,
adversarial defenses against GNN-based privacy attacks, and present a graph
perturbation-based approach, NetFense, to achieve the goal. NetFense can
simultaneously keep graph data unnoticeability (i.e., having limited changes on
the graph structure), maintain the prediction confidence of targeted label
classification (i.e., preserving data utility), and reduce the prediction
confidence of private label classification (i.e., protecting the privacy of
nodes). Experiments conducted on single- and multiple-target perturbations
using three real graph data exhibit that the perturbed graphs by NetFense can
effectively maintain data utility (i.e., model unnoticeability) on targeted
label classification and significantly decrease the prediction confidence of
private label classification (i.e., privacy protection). Extensive studies also
bring several insights, such as the flexibility of NetFense, preserving local
neighborhoods in data unnoticeability, and better privacy protection for
high-degree nodes.</span>

                                        <span>Approximate Bayesian inference for neural networks is considered a robust
alternative to standard training, often providing good performance on
out-of-distribution data. However, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with
high-fidelity approximate inference via full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
achieve poor generalization under covariate shift, even underperforming
classical estimation. We explain this surprising result, showing how a Bayesian
model average can in fact be problematic under covariate shift, particularly in
cases where linear dependencies in the input features cause a lack of posterior
contraction. We additionally show why the same issue does not affect many
approximate inference procedures, or classical maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
training. Finally, we propose novel priors that improve the robustness of BNNs
to many sources of covariate shift.</span>

engineering systems becomes essential to ensure the normal work and even the
long working life of the heat sources. However, prior methods, which mainly use
the interpolate estimation, require large amounts of temperature tensors for an
accurate estimation. To solve this problem, this work develops a novel
physics-informed deep surrogate models for temperature field reconstruction.
First, we defines the temperature field reconstruction task of heat-source
systems. Then, this work develops the deep surrogate model mapping for the
proposed task. Finally, considering the physical properties of heat transfer,
this work proposes four different losses and joint learns the deep surrogate
model with these losses. Experimental studies have conducted over typical
two-dimensional heat-source systems to demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed physics-informed deep surrogate models for
temperature field reconstruction.</span>

remarkably useful and ubiquitous tool in scientific computing and it is now
just starting to have a similar impact in machine learning. The goal of this
paper is to take a broad look into coarsening techniques that have been
successfully deployed in scientific computing and see how similar principles
are finding their way in more recent applications related to machine learning.
In scientific computing, coarsening plays a central role in algebraic multigrid
methods as well as the related class of multilevel incomplete LU
factorizations. In machine learning, graph coarsening goes under various names,
e.g., graph downsampling or graph reduction. Its goal in most cases is to
replace some original graph by one which has fewer nodes, but whose structure
and characteristics are similar to those of the original graph. As will be
seen, a common strategy in these methods is to rely on spectral properties to
define the coarse graph.</span>

                                        <span>Common compartmental modeling for COVID-19 is based on a priori knowledge and
numerous assumptions. Additionally, they do not systematically incorporate
asymptomatic cases. Our study aimed at providing a framework for data-driven
approaches, by leveraging the strengths of the grey-box system theory or
grey-box identification, known for its robustness in problem solving under
partial, incomplete, or uncertain data. Empirical data on confirmed cases and
deaths, extracted from an open source repository were used to develop the
SEAIRD compartment model. Adjustments were made to fit current knowledge on the
COVID-19 behavior. The model was implemented and solved using an Ordinary
Differential Equation solver and an optimization tool. A cross-validation
technique was applied, and the coefficient of determination $R^2$ was computed
in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. %to the data. Key
epidemiological parameters were finally estimated and we provided the rationale
for the construction of SEAIRD model. When applied to Brazil&#x27;s cases, SEAIRD
produced an excellent agreement to the data, with an %coefficient of
determination $R^2$ $\geq 90\%$. The probability of COVID-19 transmission was
generally high ($\geq 95\%$). On the basis of a 20-day modeling data, the
incidence rate of COVID-19 was as low as 3 infected cases per 100,000 exposed
persons in Brazil and France. Within the same time frame, the fatality rate of
COVID-19 was the highest in France (16.4\%) followed by Brazil (6.9\%), and the
lowest in Russia ($\leq 1\%$). SEAIRD represents an asset for modeling
infectious diseases in their dynamical stable phase, especially for new viruses
when pathophysiology knowledge is very limited.</span>

                                        <span>We consider stochastic optimization with delayed gradients where, at each
time step $t$, the algorithm makes an update using a stale stochastic gradient
from step $t - d_t$ for some arbitrary delay $d_t$. This setting abstracts
asynchronous distributed optimization where a central server receives gradient
updates computed by worker machines. These machines can experience computation
and communication loads that might vary significantly over time. In the general
non-convex smooth optimization setting, we give a simple and efficient
algorithm that requires $O( \sigma^2/\epsilon^4 + \tau/\epsilon^2 )$ steps for
finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point $x$, where $\tau$ is the \emph{average}
delay $\smash{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t&#x3D;1}^T d_t}$ and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of
the stochastic gradients. This improves over previous work, which showed that
stochastic gradient decent achieves the same rate but with respect to the
\emph{maximal} delay $\max_{t} d_t$, that can be significantly larger than the
average delay especially in heterogeneous distributed systems. Our experiments
demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithm in cases where the
delay distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed.</span>

deep learning methods falling short of promised results when evaluated on
clinical data. We investigate the accuracy and time-savings resulting from the
use of an interactive-machine-learning method for an organ-at-risk contouring
task. We compare the method to the Eclipse contouring software and find strong
agreement with manual delineations, with a dice score of 0.95. The annotations
created using corrective-annotation also take less time to create as more
images are annotated, resulting in substantial time savings compared to manual
methods, with hearts that take 2 minutes and 2 seconds to delineate on average,
after 923 images have been delineated, compared to 7 minutes and 1 seconds when
delineating manually. Our experiment demonstrates that
interactive-machine-learning with corrective-annotation provides a fast and
accessible way for non computer-scientists to train deep-learning models to
segment their own structures of interest as part of routine clinical workflows.

                                        <span>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is due to the power of
learning a representation that is suitable for the underlying exploration and
exploitation task. However, existing provable reinforcement learning algorithms
with linear function approximation often assume the feature representation is
known and fixed. In order to understand how representation learning can improve
the efficiency of RL, we study representation learning for a class of low-rank
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition kernel can be represented
in a bilinear form. We propose a provably efficient algorithm called ReLEX that
can simultaneously learn the representation and perform exploration. We show
that ReLEX always performs no worse than a state-of-the-art algorithm without
representation learning, and will be strictly better in terms of sample
efficiency if the function class of representations enjoys a certain mild
&quot;coverage&#x27;&#x27; property over the whole state-action space.</span>

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy by interaction
with an environment. Consequently, learning complex behavior requires a vast
number of samples, which can be prohibitive in practice. Nevertheless, instead
of systematically reasoning and actively choosing informative samples, policy
gradients for local search are often obtained from random perturbations. These
random samples yield high variance estimates and hence are sub-optimal in terms
of sample complexity. Actively selecting informative samples is at the core of
Bayesian optimization, which constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the
objective from past samples to reason about informative subsequent ones. In
this paper, we propose to join both worlds. We develop an algorithm utilizing a
probabilistic model of the objective function and its gradient. Based on the
model, the algorithm decides where to query a noisy zeroth-order oracle to
improve the gradient estimates. The resulting algorithm is a novel type of
policy search method, which we compare to existing black-box algorithms. The
comparison reveals improved sample complexity and reduced variance in extensive
empirical evaluations on synthetic objectives. Further, we highlight the
benefits of active sampling on popular RL benchmarks.</span>

formally define the environment with delayed rewards and discuss the challenges
raised due to the non-Markovian nature of such environments. Then, we introduce
a general off-policy RL framework with a new Q-function formulation that can
handle the delayed rewards with theoretical convergence guarantees. For
practical tasks with high dimensional state spaces, we further introduce the
HC-decomposition rule of the Q-function in our framework which naturally leads
to an approximation scheme that helps boost the training efficiency and

                                        <span>Multiple organ failure (MOF) is a severe syndrome with a high mortality rate
among Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Early and precise detection is
critical for clinicians to make timely decisions. An essential challenge in
applying machine learning models to electronic health records (EHRs) is the
pervasiveness of missing values. Most existing imputation methods are involved
in the data preprocessing phase, failing to capture the relationship between
data and outcome for downstream predictions. In this paper, we propose
classifier-guided generative adversarial imputation networks Classifier-GAIN)
for MOF prediction to bridge this gap, by incorporating both observed data and
label information. Specifically, the classifier takes imputed values from the
generator(imputer) to predict task outcomes and provides additional supervision
signals to the generator by joint training. The classifier-guide generator
imputes missing values with label-awareness during training, improving the
classifier&#x27;s performance during inference. We conduct extensive experiments
showing that our approach consistently outperforms classical and state-of-art
neural baselines across a range of missing data scenarios and evaluation
metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Algorithmic recourse aims to provide actionable recommendations to
individuals to obtain a more favourable outcome from an automated
decision-making system. As it involves reasoning about interventions performed
in the physical world, recourse is fundamentally a causal problem. Existing
methods compute the effect of recourse actions using a causal model learnt from
data under the assumption of no hidden confounding and modelling assumptions
such as additive noise. Building on the seminal work of Balke and Pearl (1994),
we propose an alternative approach for discrete random variables which relaxes
these assumptions and allows for unobserved confounding and arbitrary
structural equations. The proposed approach only requires specification of the
causal graph and confounding structure and bounds the expected counterfactual
effect of recourse actions. If the lower bound is above a certain threshold,
i.e., on the other side of the decision boundary, recourse is guaranteed in
expectation.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have reached very high accuracy on object detection but
their success hinges on large amounts of labeled data. To reduce the dependency
on labels, various active-learning strategies have been proposed, typically
based on the confidence of the detector. However, these methods are biased
towards best-performing classes and can lead to acquired datasets that are not
good representatives of the data in the testing set. In this work, we propose a
unified framework for active learning, that considers both the uncertainty and
the robustness of the detector, ensuring that the network performs accurately
in all classes. Furthermore, our method is able to pseudo-label the very
confident predictions, suppressing a potential distribution drift while further
boosting the performance of the model. Experiments show that our method
comprehensively outperforms a wide range of active-learning methods on PASCAL
VOC07+12 and MS-COCO, having up to a 7.7% relative improvement, or up to 82%

                                        <span>In this work, we consider the problem of learning a feed-forward neural
network (NN) controller to safely steer an arbitrarily shaped planar robot in a
compact and obstacle-occluded workspace. Unlike existing methods that depend
strongly on the density of data points close to the boundary of the safe state
space to train NN controllers with closed-loop safety guarantees, we propose an
approach that lifts such assumptions on the data that are hard to satisfy in
practice and instead allows for graceful safety violations, i.e., of a bounded
magnitude that can be spatially controlled. To do so, we employ reachability
analysis methods to encapsulate safety constraints in the training process.
Specifically, to obtain a computationally efficient over-approximation of the
forward reachable set of the closed-loop system, we partition the robot&#x27;s state
space into cells and adaptively subdivide the cells that contain states which
may escape the safe set under the trained control law. To do so, we first
design appropriate under- and over-approximations of the robot&#x27;s footprint to
adaptively subdivide the configuration space into cells. Then, using the
overlap between each cell&#x27;s forward reachable set and the set of infeasible
robot configurations as a measure for safety violations, we introduce penalty
terms into the loss function that penalize this overlap in the training
process. As a result, our method can learn a safe vector field for the
closed-loop system and, at the same time, provide numerical worst-case bounds
on safety violation over the whole configuration space, defined by the overlap
between the over-approximation of the forward reachable set of the closed-loop
system and the set of unsafe states. Moreover, it can control the tradeoff
between computational complexity and tightness of these bounds. Finally, we
provide a simulation study that verifies the efficacy of the proposed scheme.</span>

                                        <span>Gender-based crime is one of the most concerning scourges of contemporary
society. Governments worldwide have invested lots of economic and human
resources to radically eliminate this threat. Despite these efforts, providing
accurate predictions of the risk that a victim of gender violence has of being
attacked again is still a very hard open problem. The development of new
methods for issuing accurate, fair and quick predictions would allow police
forces to select the most appropriate measures to prevent recidivism. In this
work, we propose to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to create models
that accurately predict the recidivism risk of a gender-violence offender. The
relevance of the contribution of this work is threefold: (i) the proposed ML
method outperforms the preexisting risk assessment algorithm based on classical
statistical techniques, (ii) the study has been conducted through an official
specific-purpose database with more than 40,000 reports of gender violence, and
(iii) two new quality measures are proposed for assessing the effective police
protection that a model supplies and the overload in the invested resources
that it generates. Additionally, we propose a hybrid model that combines the
statistical prediction methods with the ML method, permitting authorities to
implement a smooth transition from the preexisting model to the ML-based model.
This hybrid nature enables a decision-making process to optimally balance
between the efficiency of the police system and aggressiveness of the
protection measures taken.</span>

Availability of sufficient pixel-level annotations for the training data is a
hurdle. Active learning helps learning from small amounts of data by suggesting
the most promising samples for labeling. In this work, we propose a new
pool-based method for active learning, which proposes promising image regions,
in each acquisition step. The problem is framed in an exploration-exploitation
framework by combining an embedding based on Uniform Manifold Approximation to
model representativeness with entropy as uncertainty measure to model
informativeness. We applied our proposed method to the challenging autonomous
driving data sets CamVid and Cityscapes and performed a quantitative comparison

better performance on CamVid compared to other methods, while on Cityscapes,

                                        <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are concise and understandable
representations of domain knowledge, which are essential for deepening our
understanding of physical processes and predicting future responses. However,
the PDEs of many real-world problems are uncertain, which calls for PDE
discovery. We propose the symbolic genetic algorithm (SGA-PDE) to discover
open-form PDEs directly from data without prior knowledge about the equation
structure. SGA-PDE focuses on the representation and optimization of PDE.
Firstly, SGA-PDE uses symbolic mathematics to realize the flexible
representation of any given PDE, transforms a PDE into a forest, and converts
each function term into a binary tree. Secondly, SGA-PDE adopts a specially
designed genetic algorithm to efficiently optimize the binary trees by
iteratively updating the tree topology and node attributes. The SGA-PDE is
gradient-free, which is a desirable characteristic in PDE discovery since it is
difficult to obtain the gradient between the PDE loss and the PDE structure. In
the experiment, SGA-PDE not only successfully discovered nonlinear Burgers&#x27;
equation, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and Chafee-Infante equation, but
also handled PDEs with fractional structure and compound functions that cannot
be solved by conventional PDE discovery methods.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we consider the framework of privacy amplification via
iteration, which is originally proposed by Feldman et al. and subsequently
simplified by Asoodeh et al. in their analysis via the contraction coefficient.
This line of work focuses on the study of the privacy guarantees obtained by
the projected noisy stochastic gradient descent (PNSGD) algorithm with hidden
intermediate updates. A limitation in the existing literature is that only the
early stopped PNSGD has been studied, while no result has been proved on the
more widely-used PNSGD applied on a shuffled dataset. Moreover, no scheme has
been yet proposed regarding how to decrease the injected noise when new data
are received in an online fashion. In this work, we first prove a privacy
guarantee for shuffled PNSGD, which is investigated asymptotically when the
noise is fixed for each sample size $n$ but reduced at a predetermined rate
when $n$ increases, in order to achieve the convergence of privacy loss. We
then analyze the online setting and provide a faster decaying scheme for the
magnitude of the injected noise that also guarantees the convergence of privacy
loss.</span>

                                        <span>Tensor network methods have been a key ingredient of advances in condensed
matter physics and have recently sparked interest in the machine learning
community for their ability to compactly represent very high-dimensional
objects. Tensor network methods can for example be used to efficiently learn
linear models in exponentially large feature spaces [Stoudenmire and Schwab,
2016]. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the VC dimension and
pseudo-dimension of a large class of tensor network models for classification,
regression and completion. Our upper bounds hold for linear models
parameterized by arbitrary tensor network structures, and we derive lower
bounds for common tensor decomposition models~(CP, Tensor Train, Tensor Ring
and Tucker) showing the tightness of our general upper bound. These results are
used to derive a generalization bound which can be applied to classification
with low rank matrices as well as linear classifiers based on any of the
commonly used tensor decomposition models. As a corollary of our results, we
obtain a bound on the VC dimension of the matrix product state classifier
introduced in [Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016] as a function of the so-called
bond dimension~(i.e. tensor train rank), which answers an open problem listed
by Cirac, Garre-Rubio and P\&#x27;erez-Garc\&#x27;ia in [Cirac et al., 2019].</span>

                                        <span>Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning approach where
clients train a global model cooperatively while keeping their local data
private. Different from cross-device FL, clients in cross-silo FL are usually
organizations or companies which may execute multiple cross-silo FL processes
repeatedly due to their time-varying local data sets, and aim to optimize their
long-term benefits by selfishly choosing their participation levels. While
there has been some work on incentivizing clients to join FL, the analysis of
the long-term selfish participation behaviors of clients in cross-silo FL
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the selfish participation
behaviors of heterogeneous clients in cross-silo FL. Specifically, we model the
long-term selfish participation behaviors of clients as an infinitely repeated
game, with the stage game being a selfish participation game in one cross-silo
FL process (SPFL). For the stage game SPFL, we derive the unique Nash
equilibrium (NE), and propose a distributed algorithm for each client to
calculate its equilibrium participation strategy. For the long-term
interactions among clients, we derive a cooperative strategy for clients which
minimizes the number of free riders while increasing the amount of local data
for model training. We show that enforced by a punishment strategy, such a
cooperative strategy is a SPNE of the infinitely repeated game, under which
some clients who are free riders at the NE of the stage game choose to be
(partial) contributors. We further propose an algorithm to calculate the
optimal SPNE which minimizes the number of free riders while maximizing the
amount of local data for model training. Simulation results show that our
proposed cooperative strategy at the optimal SPNE can effectively reduce the
number of free riders and increase the amount of local data for model training.</span>

from experience generated by a different behavior policy. Temporal difference
(TD) learning algorithms can become unstable when combined with function
approximation and off-policy sampling - this is known as the &#x27;&#x27;deadly triad&#x27;&#x27;.
Emphatic temporal difference (ETD($\lambda$)) algorithm ensures convergence in
the linear case by appropriately weighting the TD($\lambda$) updates. In this
paper, we extend the use of emphatic methods to deep reinforcement learning
agents. We show that naively adapting ETD($\lambda$) to popular deep
reinforcement learning algorithms, which use forward view multi-step returns,
results in poor performance. We then derive new emphatic algorithms for use in
the context of such algorithms, and we demonstrate that they provide noticeable
benefits in small problems designed to highlight the instability of TD methods.
Finally, we observed improved performance when applying these algorithms at
scale on classic Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment.</span>

                                        <span>Self-training is an effective approach to semi-supervised learning. The key
idea is to let the learner itself iteratively generate &quot;pseudo-supervision&quot; for
unlabeled instances based on its current hypothesis. In combination with
consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling has shown promising performance in
various domains, for example in computer vision. To account for the
hypothetical nature of the pseudo-labels, these are commonly provided in the
form of probability distributions. Still, one may argue that even a probability
distribution represents an excessive level of informedness, as it suggests that
the learner precisely knows the ground-truth conditional probabilities. In our
approach, we therefore allow the learner to label instances in the form of
credal sets, that is, sets of (candidate) probability distributions. Thanks to
this increased expressiveness, the learner is able to represent uncertainty and
a lack of knowledge in a more flexible and more faithful manner. To learn from
weakly labeled data of that kind, we leverage methods that have recently been
proposed in the realm of so-called superset learning. In an exhaustive
empirical evaluation, we compare our methodology to state-of-the-art
self-supervision approaches, showing competitive to superior performance
especially in low-label scenarios incorporating a high degree of uncertainty.</span>

                                        <span>In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn
a sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification
problem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous
tasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is
available at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform
cross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been
seen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make
use of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we
ablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the
performance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new
forgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is
not the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that
future algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent
forgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features.
This is especially important when the number of classes per task is small.</span>

speech recognition performance, and for many individuals with
moderate-to-severe speech disorders, voice operated systems do not work.
Current speech recognition systems are trained primarily with data from fluent
speakers and as a consequence do not generalize well to speech with
dysfluencies such as sound or word repetitions, sound prolongations, or audible
blocks. The focus of this work is on quantitative analysis of a consumer speech
recognition system on individuals who stutter and production-oriented
approaches for improving performance for common voice assistant tasks (i.e.,
&quot;what is the weather?&quot;). At baseline, this system introduces a significant
number of insertion and substitution errors resulting in intended speech Word
Error Rates (isWER) that are 13.64\% worse (absolute) for individuals with
fluency disorders. We show that by simply tuning the decoding parameters in an
existing hybrid speech recognition system one can improve isWER by 24\%
(relative) for individuals with fluency disorders. Tuning these parameters
translates to 3.6\% better domain recognition and 1.7\% better intent
recognition relative to the default setup for the 18 study participants across
all stuttering severities.</span>

                                        <span>The non-stationary nature of data streams strongly challenges traditional
machine learning techniques. Although some solutions have been proposed to
extend traditional machine learning techniques for handling data streams, these
approaches either require an initial label set or rely on specialized design
parameters. The overlap among classes and the labeling of data streams
constitute other major challenges for classifying data streams. In this paper,
we proposed a clustering-based data stream classification framework to handle
non-stationary data streams without utilizing an initial label set. A
density-based stream clustering procedure is used to capture novel concepts
with a dynamic threshold and an effective active label querying strategy is
introduced to continuously learn the new concepts from the data streams. The
sub-cluster structure of each cluster is explored to handle the overlap among
classes. Experimental results and quantitative comparison studies reveal that
the proposed method provides statistically better or comparable performance
than the existing methods.</span>

datasets from very limited observations is of paramount interest in many
scientific fields. However, it remains an open question to know when model
discovery algorithms based on sparse regression can actually recover the
underlying physical processes. We trace back the poor of performance of Lasso
based model discovery algorithms to its potential variable selection
inconsistency: meaning that even if the true model is present in the library,
it might not be selected. By first revisiting the irrepresentability condition
(IRC) of the Lasso, we gain some insights of when this might occur. We then
show that the adaptive Lasso will have more chances of verifying the IRC than
the Lasso and propose to integrate it within a deep learning model discovery
framework with stability selection and error control. Experimental results show
we can recover several nonlinear and chaotic canonical PDEs with a single set
of hyperparameters from a very limited number of samples at high noise levels.</span>

accurate predictions, but do not discriminate against specific groups. It is a
fast-growing area of machine learning with far-reaching societal impact.
However, existing fair learning methods are vulnerable to accidental or
malicious artifacts in the training data, which can cause them to unknowingly
produce unfair classifiers. In this work we address the problem of fair
learning from unreliable training data in the robust multisource setting, where
the available training data comes from multiple sources, a fraction of which
might be not representative of the true data distribution. We introduce FLEA, a
filtering-based algorithm that allows the learning system to identify and
suppress those data sources that would have a negative impact on fairness or
accuracy if they were used for training. We show the effectiveness of our
approach by a diverse range of experiments on multiple datasets. Additionally
we prove formally that, given enough data, FLEA protects the learner against
unreliable data as long as the fraction of affected data sources is less than
half.</span>

                                        <span>Model checking has been developed for verifying the behaviour of systems with
stochastic and non-deterministic behavior. It is used to provide guarantees
about such systems. While most model checking methods focus on propositional
models, various probabilistic planning and reinforcement frameworks deal with
relational domains, for instance, STRIPS planning and relational Markov
Decision Processes. Using propositional model checking in relational settings
requires one to ground the model, which leads to the well known state explosion
problem and intractability. We present pCTL-REBEL, a lifted model checking
approach for verifying pCTL properties on relational MDPs. It extends REBEL,
the relational Bellman update operator, which is a lifted value iteration
approach for model-based relational reinforcement learning, toward relational
model-checking. PCTL-REBEL is lifted, which means that rather than grounding,
the model exploits symmetries and reasons at an abstract relational level.
Theoretically, we show that the pCTL model checking approach is decidable for
relational MDPs even for possibly infinite domains provided that the states
have a bounded size. Practically, we contribute algorithms and an
implementation of lifted relational model checking, and we show that the lifted
approach improves the scalability of the model checking approach.</span>

non-wearable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) promises to improve the quality
of diagnosis and facilitate timely treatment for a gamut of medical conditions.
At the same time, the proliferation of IoMT devices increases the potential for
malicious activities that can lead to catastrophic results including theft of
personal information, data breach, and compromised medical devices, putting
human lives at risk. IoMT devices generate tremendous amount of data that
reflect user behavior patterns including both personal and day-to-day social
activities along with daily routine health monitoring. In this context, there
are possibilities of anomalies generated due to various reasons including
unexpected user behavior, faulty sensor, or abnormal values from
malicious/compromised devices. To address this problem, there is an imminent
need to develop a framework for securing the smart health care infrastructure
to identify and mitigate anomalies. In this paper, we present an anomaly
detection model for RPM utilizing IoMT and smart home devices. We propose
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based anomaly detection that analyzes normal user
behavior in the context of RPM comprising both smart home and smart health
devices, and identifies anomalous user behavior. We design a testbed with
multiple IoMT devices and home sensors to collect data and use the HMM model to
train using network and user behavioral data. Proposed HMM based anomaly
detection model achieved over 98% accuracy in identifying the anomalies in the
context of RPM.</span>

differ from priors on the training set. In the case of such prior shift,
classifiers must be adapted correspondingly to maintain close to optimal
performance. This paper analyzes methods for adaptation of probabilistic
classifiers to new priors and for estimating new priors on an unlabeled test
set. We propose a novel method to address a known issue of prior estimation
methods based on confusion matrices, where inconsistent estimates of decision
probabilities and confusion matrices lead to negative values in the estimated
priors. Experiments on fine-grained image classification datasets provide
insight into the best practice of prior shift estimation and classifier
adaptation and show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results
in prior adaptation. Applying the best practice to two tasks with naturally
imbalanced priors, learning from web-crawled images and plant species
classification, increased the recognition accuracy by 1.1% and 3.4%
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Modern pre-trained language models are mostly built upon backbones stacking
self-attention and feed-forward layers in an interleaved order. In this paper,
beyond this stereotyped layer pattern, we aim to improve pre-trained models by
exploiting layer variety from two aspects: the layer type set and the layer
order. Specifically, besides the original self-attention and feed-forward
layers, we introduce convolution into the layer type set, which is
experimentally found beneficial to pre-trained models. Furthermore, beyond the
original interleaved order, we explore more layer orders to discover more
powerful architectures. However, the introduced layer variety leads to a large
architecture space of more than billions of candidates, while training a single
candidate model from scratch already requires huge computation cost, making it
not affordable to search such a space by directly training large amounts of
candidate models. To solve this problem, we first pre-train a supernet from
which the weights of all candidate models can be inherited, and then adopt an
evolutionary algorithm guided by pre-training accuracy to find the optimal
architecture. Extensive experiments show that LV-BERT model obtained by our
method outperforms BERT and its variants on various downstream tasks. For
example, LV-BERT-small achieves 78.8 on the GLUE testing set, 1.8 higher than
the strong baseline ELECTRA-small.</span>

                                        <span>Speech production is a dynamic procedure, which involved multi human organs
including the tongue, jaw and lips. Modeling the dynamics of the vocal tract
deformation is a fundamental problem to understand the speech, which is the
most common way for human daily communication. Researchers employ several
sensory streams to describe the process simultaneously, which are
incontrovertibly statistically related to other streams. In this paper, we
address the following question: given an observable image sequences of lips,
can we picture the corresponding tongue motion. We formulated this problem as
the self-supervised learning problem, and employ the two-stream convolutional
network and long-short memory network for the learning task, with the attention
mechanism. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by leveraging the
unlabeled lip videos to predict an upcoming ultrasound tongue image sequence.
The results show that our model is able to generate images that close to the
real ultrasound tongue images, and results in the matching between two imaging
modalities.</span>

                                        <span>The emergence of digital technologies such as smartphones in healthcare
applications have demonstrated the possibility of developing rich, continuous,
and objective measures of multiple sclerosis (MS) disability that can be
administered remotely and out-of-clinic. In this work, deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNN) applied to smartphone inertial sensor data were shown to
better distinguish healthy from MS participant ambulation, compared to standard
Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature-based methodologies. To overcome the
typical limitations associated with remotely generated health data, such as low
subject numbers, sparsity, and heterogeneous data, a transfer learning (TL)
model from similar large open-source datasets was proposed. Our TL framework
utilised the ambulatory information learned on Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
tasks collected from similar smartphone-based sensor data. A lack of
transparency of &quot;black-box&quot; deep networks remains one of the largest stumbling
blocks to the wider acceptance of deep learning for clinical applications.
Ensuing work therefore aimed to visualise DCNN decisions attributed by
relevance heatmaps using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Through the
LRP framework, the patterns captured from smartphone-based inertial sensor data
that were reflective of those who are healthy versus persons with MS (PwMS)
could begin to be established and understood. Interpretations suggested that
cadence-based measures, gait speed, and ambulation-related signal perturbations
were distinct characteristics that distinguished MS disability from healthy
participants. Robust and interpretable outcomes, generated from high-frequency
out-of-clinic assessments, could greatly augment the current in-clinic
assessment picture for PwMS, to inform better disease management techniques,
and enable the development of better therapeutic interventions.</span>

propose to incorporate the variance information of the value function to

VA-OPE, which uses the estimated variance of the value function to reweight the

million volunteers, collecting health-related information on genetics,
lifestyle, blood biochemistry, and more. Medical imaging furthermore targets
100,000 subjects, with 70,000 follow-up sessions, enabling measurements of
organs, muscle, and body composition. With up to 170,000 mounting MR images,
various methodologies are accordingly engaged in large-scale image analysis.
This work presents an experimental inference engine that can automatically
predict a comprehensive profile of subject metadata from UKB neck-to-knee body
MRI. In cross-validation, it accurately inferred baseline characteristics such
as age, height, weight, and sex, but also emulated measurements of body
composition by DXA, organ volumes, and abstract properties like grip strength,
pulse rate, and type 2 diabetic status (AUC: 0.866). The proposed system can
automatically analyze thousands of subjects within hours and provide individual
confidence intervals. The underlying methodology is based on convolutional
neural networks for image-based mean-variance regression on two-dimensional
representations of the MRI data. This work aims to make the proposed system
available for free to researchers, who can use it to obtain fast and
fully-automated estimates of 72 different measurements immediately upon release
of new UK Biobank image data.</span>

multi-armed bandits. Recently, empirical Bayesian shrinkage has been shown to
improve reward estimation in bandit learning. Here, we propose a novel
adaptation to shrinkage that estimates smoothed reward estimates from windowed
cumulative inputs, to deal with incomplete knowledge from delayed feedback and
non-stationary rewards. Using numerical simulations, we show that this
adaptation retains the benefits of shrinkage, and improves the stability of
reward estimation by more than 50%. Our proposal reduces variability in
treatment allocations to the best arm by up to 3.8x, and improves statistical
accuracy - with up to 8% improvement in true positive rates and 37% reduction
in false positive rates. Together, these advantages enable control of the
trade-off between speed and stability of adaptation, and facilitate
human-in-the-loop sequential optimisation.</span>

deep ReLU network function approximation. We analyze a variant of fitted-Q
iteration (FQI) algorithm under a new dynamic condition that we call Besov
dynamic closure, which encompasses the conditions from prior analyses for deep
neural network function approximation. Under Besov dynamic closure, we prove
that the FQI-type algorithm enjoys the sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \kappa^{1 + d/\alpha} \cdot \epsilon^{-2 -
2d/\alpha} \right)$ where $\kappa$ is a distribution shift measure, $d$ is the
dimensionality of the state-action space, $\alpha$ is the (possibly fractional)
smoothness parameter of the underlying MDP, and $\epsilon$ is a user-specified
precision. This is an improvement over the sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( K \cdot \kappa^{2 + d/\alpha} \cdot \epsilon^{-2 -
d/\alpha} \right)$ in the prior result [Yang et al., 2019] where $K$ is an
algorithmic iteration number which is arbitrarily large in practice.
Importantly, our sample complexity is obtained under the new general dynamic
condition and a data-dependent structure where the latter is either ignored in
prior algorithms or improperly handled by prior analyses. This is the first
comprehensive analysis for offline RL with deep ReLU network function
approximation under a general setting.</span>

                                        <span>Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects
such as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for
networks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised
network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without
external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the
local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI
for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node
classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI
merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information
between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal
(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).
Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges
with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various
relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a
novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning
node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more
specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic
and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we
propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision
signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node
embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering
and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.</span>

                                        <span>We study fast algorithms for statistical regression problems under the strong
contamination model, where the goal is to approximately optimize a generalized
linear model (GLM) given adversarially corrupted samples. Prior works in this
line of research were based on the robust gradient descent framework of Prasad
et. al., a first-order method using biased gradient queries, or the Sever
framework of Diakonikolas et. al., an iterative outlier-removal method calling
a stationary point finder.

We present nearly-linear time algorithms for robust regression problems with
improved runtime or estimation guarantees compared to the state-of-the-art. For
the general case of smooth GLMs (e.g. logistic regression), we show that the
robust gradient descent framework of Prasad et. al. can be accelerated, and
show our algorithm extends to optimizing the Moreau envelopes of Lipschitz GLMs
(e.g. support vector machines), answering several open questions in the
literature.

For the well-studied case of robust linear regression, we present an
alternative approach obtaining improved estimation rates over prior
nearly-linear time algorithms. Interestingly, our method starts with an
identifiability proof introduced in the context of the sum-of-squares algorithm
of Bakshi and Prasad, which achieved optimal error rates while requiring large
polynomial runtime and sample complexity. We reinterpret their proof within the
Sever framework and obtain a dramatically faster and more sample-efficient
algorithm under fewer distributional assumptions.</span>

Bayesian neural network for regression, and show that it exhibits strong
dependencies on the lower-layer weights. We adapt this result to develop a
correlated approximate posterior over the weights at all layers in a Bayesian
neural network. We extend this approach to deep Gaussian processes, unifying
inference in the two model classes. Our approximate posterior uses learned
&quot;global&quot; inducing points, which are defined only at the input layer and
propagated through the network to obtain inducing inputs at subsequent layers.
By contrast, standard, &quot;local&quot;, inducing point methods from the deep Gaussian
process literature optimise a separate set of inducing inputs at every layer,
and thus do not model correlations across layers. Our method gives
state-of-the-art performance for a variational Bayesian method, without data

Property protection of generative models. Prior solutions for discriminative
models usually adopt adversarial examples as the fingerprints, which give
anomalous inference behaviors and prediction results. Hence, these methods are
not stealthy and can be easily recognized by the adversary. Our approach
leverages the invisible backdoor technique to overcome the above limitation.
Specifically, we design verification samples, whose model outputs look normal
but can trigger a backdoor classifier to make abnormal predictions. We propose
a new backdoor embedding approach with Unique-Triplet Loss and fine-grained
categorization to enhance the effectiveness of our fingerprints. Extensive
evaluations show that this solution can outperform other strategies with higher
robustness, uniqueness and stealthiness for various GAN models.</span>

predict physical systems from observation data. Yet, they are often used as
poorly understood &quot;black boxes,&quot; disregarding existing mathematical structure
and invariants of the problem. Recently, the proposal of Hamiltonian Neural
Networks (HNNs) took a first step towards a unified &quot;gray box&quot; approach, using
physical insight to improve performance for Hamiltonian systems. In this paper,
we explore a significantly improved training method for HNNs, exploiting the
symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems with a different loss function.
This frees the loss from an artificial lower bound. We mathematically guarantee
the existence of an exact Hamiltonian function which the HNN can learn. This
allows us to prove and numerically analyze the errors made by HNNs which, in
turn, renders them fully explainable. Finally, we present a novel post-training
correction to obtain the true Hamiltonian only from discretized observation
data, up to an arbitrary order.</span>

industrial and scientific applications. However, community efforts to advance
large-scale graph ML have been severely limited by the lack of a suitable
public benchmark. For KDD Cup 2021, we present OGB Large-Scale Challenge
(OGB-LSC), a collection of three real-world datasets for advancing the
state-of-the-art in large-scale graph ML. OGB-LSC provides graph datasets that
are orders of magnitude larger than existing ones and covers three core graph
learning tasks -- link prediction, graph regression, and node classification.
Furthermore, OGB-LSC provides dedicated baseline experiments, scaling up
expressive graph ML models to the massive datasets. We show that the expressive
models significantly outperform simple scalable baselines, indicating an
opportunity for dedicated efforts to further improve graph ML at scale. Our
datasets and baseline code are released and maintained as part of our OGB

                                        <span>Data assimilation (DA) is widely used to combine physical knowledge and
observations. It is nowadays commonly used in geosciences to perform parametric
calibration. In a context of climate change, old calibrations can not
necessarily be used for new scenarios. This raises the question of DA
computational cost, as costly physics-based numerical models need to be
reanalyzed. Reduction and metamodelling represent therefore interesting
perspectives, for example proposed in recent contributions as hybridization
between ensemble and variational methods, to combine their advantages
(efficiency, non-linear framework). They are however often based on Monte Carlo
(MC) type sampling, which often requires considerable increase of the ensemble
size for better efficiency, therefore representing a computational burden in
ensemble-based methods as well. To address these issues, two methods to replace
the complex model by a surrogate are proposed and confronted : (i) PODEn3DVAR
directly inspired from PODEn4DVAR, relies on an ensemble-based joint
parameter-state Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which provides a linear
metamodel ; (ii) POD-PCE-3DVAR, where the model states are POD reduced then
learned using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), resulting in a non-linear
metamodel. Both metamodels allow to write an approximate cost function whose
minimum can be analytically computed, or deduced by a gradient descent at
negligible cost. Furthermore, adapted metamodelling error covariance matrix is
given for POD-PCE-3DVAR, allowing to substantially improve the metamodel-based
DA analysis. Proposed methods are confronted on a twin experiment, and compared
to classical 3DVAR on a measurement-based problem. Results are promising, in
particular superior with POD-PCE-3DVAR, showing good convergence to classical
3DVAR and robustness to noise.</span>

                                        <span>We consider repair tasks: given a critic (e.g., compiler) that assesses the
quality of an input, the goal is to train a fixer that converts a bad example
(e.g., code with syntax errors) into a good one (e.g., code with no syntax
errors). Existing works create training data consisting of (bad, good) pairs by
corrupting good examples using heuristics (e.g., dropping tokens). However,
fixers trained on this synthetically-generated data do not extrapolate well to
the real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new
training approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key ideas: (i) we use
the critic to check a fixer&#x27;s output on real bad inputs and add good (fixed)
outputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate realistic
bad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the
breaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired
data. We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new
dataset we introduce where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse
errors; and DeepFix, where the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors.
BIFI outperforms existing methods, obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on
GitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%). Notably, BIFI does not
require any labeled data; we hope it will be a strong starting point for
unsupervised learning of various repair tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Genetic Programming (GP) is known to suffer from the burden of being
computationally expensive by design. While, over the years, many techniques
have been developed to mitigate this issue, data vectorization, in particular,
is arguably still the most attractive strategy due to the parallel nature of
GP. In this work, we employ a series of benchmarks meant to compare both the
performance and evolution capabilities of different vectorized and iterative
implementation approaches across several existing frameworks. Namely, TensorGP,
a novel open-source engine written in Python, is shown to greatly benefit from
the TensorFlow library to accelerate the domain evaluation phase in GP. The
presented performance benchmarks demonstrate that the TensorGP engine manages
to pull ahead, with relative speedups above two orders of magnitude for
problems with a higher number of fitness cases. Additionally, as a consequence
of being able to compute larger domains, we argue that TensorGP performance
gains aid the discovery of more accurate candidate solutions.</span>

                                        <span>Topic modeling is an unsupervised method for revealing the hidden semantic
structure of a corpus. It has been increasingly widely adopted as a tool in the
social sciences, including political science, digital humanities and
sociological research in general. One desirable property of topic models is to
allow users to find topics describing a specific aspect of the corpus. A
possible solution is to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into topic
modeling, but this requires a specification from domain experts. We propose a
novel query-driven topic model that allows users to specify a simple query in
words or phrases and return query-related topics, thus avoiding tedious work
from domain experts. Our proposed approach is particularly attractive when the
user-specified query has a low occurrence in a text corpus, making it difficult
for traditional topic models built on word cooccurrence patterns to identify
relevant topics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model in comparison with both classical topic models and neural topic models.</span>

                                        <span>The quest for determinism in machine learning has disproportionately focused
on characterizing the impact of noise introduced by algorithmic design choices.
In this work, we address a less well understood and studied question: how does
our choice of tooling introduce randomness to deep neural network training. We
conduct large scale experiments across different types of hardware,
accelerators, state of art networks, and open-source datasets, to characterize
how tooling choices contribute to the level of non-determinism in a system, the
impact of said non-determinism, and the cost of eliminating different sources
of noise.

Our findings are surprising, and suggest that the impact of non-determinism
in nuanced. While top-line metrics such as top-1 accuracy are not noticeably
impacted, model performance on certain parts of the data distribution is far
more sensitive to the introduction of randomness. Our results suggest that
deterministic tooling is critical for AI safety. However, we also find that the
cost of ensuring determinism varies dramatically between neural network
architectures and hardware types, e.g., with overhead up to $746\%$, $241\%$,
and $196\%$ on a spectrum of widely used GPU accelerator architectures,
relative to non-deterministic training. The source code used in this paper is

assumptions, with a limited understanding how and why these work in practice.
To shed more light on this, our work provides some deeper understandings of how
SGD behaves by empirically analyzing the trajectory taken by SGD from a line
search perspective. Specifically, a costly quantitative analysis of the
full-batch loss along SGD trajectories from common used models trained on a
subset of CIFAR-10 is performed. Our core results include that the full-batch
loss along lines in update step direction is highly parabolically. Further on,
we show that there exists a learning rate with which SGD always performs almost
exact line searches on the full-batch loss. Finally, we provide a different
perspective why increasing the batch size has almost the same effect as
decreasing the learning rate by the same factor.</span>

of segment detection and event detection on both test datasets of HF_Lung_V1

                                        <span>The recent rise of privacy concerns has led researchers to devise methods for
private neural inference -- where inferences are made directly on encrypted
data, never seeing inputs. The primary challenge facing private inference is
that computing on encrypted data levies an impractically-high latency penalty,
stemming mostly from non-linear operators like ReLU. Enabling practical and
private inference requires new optimization methods that minimize network ReLU
counts while preserving accuracy. This paper proposes DeepReDuce: a set of
optimizations for the judicious removal of ReLUs to reduce private inference
latency. The key insight is that not all ReLUs contribute equally to accuracy.
We leverage this insight to drop, or remove, ReLUs from classic networks to
significantly reduce inference latency and maintain high accuracy. Given a
target network, DeepReDuce outputs a Pareto frontier of networks that tradeoff
the number of ReLUs and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art for private
inference DeepReDuce improves accuracy and reduces ReLU count by up to 3.5%
(iso-ReLU count) and 3.5$\times$ (iso-accuracy), respectively.</span>

                                        <span>The classical Langevin Monte Carlo method looks for i.i.d. samples from a
target distribution by descending along the gradient of the target
distribution. It is popular partially due to its fast convergence rate.
However, the numerical cost is sometimes high because the gradient can be hard
to obtain. One approach to eliminate the gradient computation is to employ the
concept of &quot;ensemble&quot;, where a large number of particles are evolved together
so that the neighboring particles provide gradient information to each other.
In this article, we discuss two algorithms that integrate the ensemble feature
into LMC, and the associated properties. There are two sides of our discovery:

1. By directly surrogating the gradient using the ensemble approximation, we
develop Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo. We show that this method is unstable due
to a potentially small denominator that induces high variance. We provide a
counterexample to explicitly show this instability.

2. We then change the strategy and enact the ensemble approximation to the
gradient only in a constrained manner, to eliminate the unstable points. The
algorithm is termed Constrained Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo. We show that,
with a proper tuning, the surrogation takes place often enough to bring the
reasonable numerical saving, while the induced error is still low enough for us
to maintain the fast convergence rate, up to a controllable discretization and
ensemble error.

Such combination of ensemble method and LMC shed light on inventing
gradient-free algorithms that produce i.i.d. samples almost exponentially fast.</span>

                                        <span>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that predictive models may benefit from
algorithmic triage. Under algorithmic triage, a predictive model does not
predict all instances but instead defers some of them to human experts.
However, the interplay between the prediction accuracy of the model and the
human experts under algorithmic triage is not well understood. In this work, we
start by formally characterizing under which circumstances a predictive model
may benefit from algorithmic triage. In doing so, we also demonstrate that
models trained for full automation may be suboptimal under triage. Then, given
any model and desired level of triage, we show that the optimal triage policy
is a deterministic threshold rule in which triage decisions are derived
deterministically by thresholding the difference between the model and human
errors on a per-instance level. Building upon these results, we introduce a
practical gradient-based algorithm that is guaranteed to find a sequence of
triage policies and predictive models of increasing performance. Experiments on
a wide variety of supervised learning tasks using synthetic and real data from
two important applications -- content moderation and scientific discovery --
illustrate our theoretical results and show that the models and triage policies
provided by our gradient-based algorithm outperform those provided by several
competitive baselines.</span>

                                        <span>\textit{Stochastic gradient descent} (SGD) is of fundamental importance in
deep learning. Despite its simplicity, elucidating its efficacy remains
challenging. Conventionally, the success of SGD is attributed to the
\textit{stochastic gradient noise} (SGN) incurred in the training process.
Based on this general consensus, SGD is frequently treated and analyzed as the
Euler-Maruyama discretization of a \textit{stochastic differential equation}
(SDE) driven by either Brownian or L\&#x27;evy stable motion. In this study, we
argue that SGN is neither Gaussian nor stable. Instead, inspired by the
long-time correlation emerging in SGN series, we propose that SGD can be viewed
as a discretization of an SDE driven by \textit{fractional Brownian motion}
(FBM). Accordingly, the different convergence behavior of SGD dynamics is well
grounded. Moreover, the first passage time of an SDE driven by FBM is
approximately derived. This indicates a lower escaping rate for a larger Hurst
parameter, and thus SGD stays longer in flat minima. This happens to coincide
with the well-known phenomenon that SGD favors flat minima that generalize
well. Four groups of experiments are conducted to validate our conjecture, and
it is demonstrated that long-range memory effects persist across various model
architectures, datasets, and training strategies. Our study opens up a new
perspective and may contribute to a better understanding of SGD.</span>

                                        <span>Semi-supervised learning has been gaining attention as it allows for
performing image analysis tasks such as classification with limited labeled
data. Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
semi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification
and discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate
data distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While
progress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are
small-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable
and unattainable. We therefore, propose a novel GAN model namely External
Classifier GAN (EC-GAN), that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to
improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN
to generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More
specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the
GAN&#x27;s generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator.
Our experiments demonstrate that EC-GAN&#x27;s performance is comparable to the
shared architecture method, far superior to the standard data augmentation and
regularization-based approach, and effective on a small, realistic dataset.</span>

catastrophic forgetting by keeping a buffer of patterns from previous
experiences, which are interleaved with new data during training. The amount of

the final performance and the memory footprint of the approach. This work
introduces Distilled Replay, a novel replay strategy for Continual Learning

importance. High quality explanations are the first step in assessing fairness.
Counterfactuals are valuable tools for explainability. They provide actionable,
comprehensible explanations for the individual who is subject to decisions made
from the prediction. It is important to find a baseline for producing them. We
propose a simple method for generating counterfactuals by using gradient
descent to search in the latent space of an autoencoder and benchmark our
method against approaches that search for counterfactuals in feature space.
Additionally, we implement metrics to concretely evaluate the quality of the
counterfactuals. We show that latent space counterfactual generation strikes a

tail-risk measures in finance and insurance industries as well as in highly
reliable, safety-critical uncertain environments where often the underlying
probability distributions are heavy-tailed. We use the multi-armed bandit
best-arm identification framework and consider the problem of identifying the
arm from amongst finitely many that has the smallest CVaR, VaR, or weighted sum
of CVaR and mean. The latter captures the risk-return trade-off common in
finance. Our main contribution is an optimal $\delta$-correct algorithm that
acts on general arms, including heavy-tailed distributions, and matches the
lower bound on the expected number of samples needed, asymptotically (as
$\delta$ approaches $0$). The algorithm requires solving a non-convex
optimization problem in the space of probability measures, that requires
delicate analysis. En-route, we develop new non-asymptotic empirical
likelihood-based concentration inequalities for tail-risk measures which are
tighter than those for popular truncation-based empirical estimators.</span>

utilized in modern data science, and seek to partition the dataset into
clusters while generating a hierarchical relationship between the data samples.
HAC algorithms are employed in many applications, such as biology, natural
language processing, and recommender systems. Thus, it is imperative to ensure
that these algorithms are fair -- even if the dataset contains biases against
certain protected groups, the cluster outputs generated should not discriminate
against samples from any of these groups. However, recent work in clustering
fairness has mostly focused on center-based clustering algorithms, such as
k-median and k-means clustering. In this paper, we propose fair algorithms for
performing HAC that enforce fairness constraints 1) irrespective of the
distance linkage criteria used, 2) generalize to any natural measures of
clustering fairness for HAC, 3) work for multiple protected groups, and 4) have
competitive running times to vanilla HAC. Through extensive experiments on
multiple real-world UCI datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm finds

                                        <span>This paper presents a batch-wise density-based clustering approach for local
outlier detection in massive-scale datasets. Unlike the well-known traditional
algorithms, which assume that all the data is memory-resident, our proposed
method is scalable and processes the input data chunk-by-chunk within the
confines of a limited memory buffer. A temporary clustering model is built at
the first phase; then, it is gradually updated by analyzing consecutive memory
loads of points. Subsequently, at the end of scalable clustering, the
approximate structure of the original clusters is obtained. Finally, by another
scan of the entire dataset and using a suitable criterion, an outlying score is
assigned to each object called SDCOR (Scalable Density-based Clustering
Outlierness Ratio). Evaluations on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method has a low linear time complexity and is more effective
and efficient compared to best-known conventional density-based methods, which
need to load all data into the memory; and also, to some fast distance-based
methods, which can perform on data resident in the disk.</span>

defense method against gray- and black-box attack, which is computationally
efficient and does not require any adversarial training or retraining of a
classification model. We first show that a very simple iterative Gaussian
smoothing can effectively wash out adversarial noise and achieve substantially
high robust accuracy. Based on the observation, we propose Self-Supervised
Iterative Contextual Smoothing (SSICS), which aims to reconstruct the original
discriminative features from the Gaussian-smoothed image in context-adaptive
manner, while still smoothing out the adversarial noise. From the experiments
on ImageNet, we show that our SSICS achieves both high standard accuracy and
very competitive robust accuracy for the gray- and black-box attacks; e.g.,
transfer-based PGD-attack and score-based attack. A note-worthy point to stress
is that our defense is free of computationally expensive adversarial training,
yet, can approach its robust accuracy via input transformation.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture for compressing an
image when a correlated image is available as side information only at the
decoder. This problem is known as distributed source coding (DSC) in
information theory. In particular, we consider a pair of stereo images, which
generally have high correlation with each other due to overlapping fields of
view, and assume that one image of the pair is to be compressed and
transmitted, while the other image is available only at the decoder. In the
proposed architecture, the encoder maps the input image to a latent space,
quantizes the latent representation, and compresses it using entropy coding.
The decoder is trained to extract the Wyner&#x27;s common information between the
input image and the correlated image from the latter. The received latent
representation and the locally generated common information are passed through
a decoder network to obtain an enhanced reconstruction of the input image. The
common information provides a succinct representation of the relevant
information at the receiver. We train and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach on the KITTI dataset of stereo image pairs. Our results show
that the proposed architecture is capable of exploiting the decoder-only side
information, and outperforms previous work on stereo image compression with
decoder side information.</span>

motivated by the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (CG) framework. We propose the
Conjugate Gradient with Quadratic line-search (CGQ) method. On the one hand, a
quadratic line-search determines the step size according to current loss
landscape. On the other hand, the momentum factor is dynamically updated in
computing the conjugate gradient parameter (like Polak-Ribiere). Theoretical
results to ensure the convergence of our method in strong convex settings is
developed. And experiments in image classification datasets show that our
method yields faster convergence than other local solvers and has better
generalization capability (test set accuracy). One major advantage of the paper
method is that tedious hand tuning of hyperparameters like the learning rate
and momentum is avoided.</span>

                                        <span>Deep ensembles have recently gained popularity in the deep learning community
for their conceptual simplicity and efficiency. However, maintaining functional
diversity between ensemble members that are independently trained with gradient
descent is challenging. This can lead to pathologies when adding more ensemble
members, such as a saturation of the ensemble performance, which converges to
the performance of a single model. Moreover, this does not only affect the
quality of its predictions, but even more so the uncertainty estimates of the
ensemble, and thus its performance on out-of-distribution data. We hypothesize
that this limitation can be overcome by discouraging different ensemble members
from collapsing to the same function. To this end, we introduce a kernelized
repulsive term in the update rule of the deep ensembles. We show that this
simple modification not only enforces and maintains diversity among the members
but, even more importantly, transforms the maximum a posteriori inference into
proper Bayesian inference. Namely, we show that the training dynamics of our
proposed repulsive ensembles follow a Wasserstein gradient flow of the KL
divergence with the true posterior. We study repulsive terms in weight and
function space and empirically compare their performance to standard ensembles
and Bayesian baselines on synthetic and real-world prediction tasks.</span>

various real-world problems on graph data. However in most industries, data
exists in the form of isolated islands and the data privacy and security is
also an important issue. In this paper, we propose FedVGCN, a federated GCN
learning paradigm for privacy-preserving node classification task under data
vertically partitioned setting, which can be generalized to existing GCN
models. Specifically, we split the computation graph data into two parts. For
each iteration of the training process, the two parties transfer intermediate
results to each other under homomorphic encryption. We conduct experiments on
benchmark data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedVGCN in the

Neural graph differential equations (Neural GDEs) are formalized as the
counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a
continuum of GNN layers, blending discrete topological structures and
differential equations. The proposed framework is shown to be compatible with
static GNN models and is extended to dynamic and stochastic settings through
hybrid dynamical system theory. Here, Neural GDEs improve performance by
exploiting the underlying dynamics geometry, further introducing the ability to

                                        <span>Federated learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to train models locally and formulate a global model, without
sharing the clients&#x27; local data. A federated learning system can be viewed as a
large-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders
with diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated
learning system requires both software system design thinking and machine
learning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning
from the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature
review on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for
software architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose
FLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a
template design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA
reference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of
federated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial
implementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of
architectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design
problems in federated learning architectures. The FLRA reference architecture
can serve as a design guideline to assist architects and developers with
practical solutions for their problems, which can be further customised.</span>

constraint where the agent is asked to perform at least as well as a given
baseline policy. This setting is particular relevant in real-world domains
including digital marketing, healthcare, production, finance, etc. For
multi-armed bandits, linear bandits and tabular RL, specialized algorithms and
theoretical analyses were proposed in previous work. In this paper, we present
a unified framework for conservative bandits and RL, in which our core
technique is to calculate the necessary and sufficient budget obtained from
running the baseline policy. For lower bounds, our framework gives a black-box
reduction that turns a certain lower bound in the nonconservative setting into
a new lower bound in the conservative setting. We strengthen the existing lower
bound for conservative multi-armed bandits and obtain new lower bounds for
conservative linear bandits, tabular RL and low-rank MDP. For upper bounds, our
framework turns a certain nonconservative upper-confidence-bound (UCB)
algorithm into a conservative algorithm with a simple analysis. For multi-armed
bandits, linear bandits and tabular RL, our new upper bounds tighten or match
existing ones with significantly simpler analyses. We also obtain a new upper

                                        <span>Graph representation learning is a fundamental problem for modeling
relational data and benefits a number of downstream applications. Traditional
Bayesian-based graph models and recent deep learning based GNN either suffer
from impracticability or lack interpretability, thus combined models for
undirected graphs have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses. As a large
portion of real-world graphs are directed graphs (of which undirected graphs
are special cases), in this paper, we propose a Deep Latent Space Model (DLSM)
for directed graphs to incorporate the traditional latent variable based
generative model into deep learning frameworks. Our proposed model consists of
a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a stochastic decoder, which are
layer-wise connected by a hierarchical variational auto-encoder architecture.
By specifically modeling the degree heterogeneity using node random factors,
our model possesses better interpretability in both community structure and
degree heterogeneity. For fast inference, the stochastic gradient variational
Bayes (SGVB) is adopted using a non-iterative recognition model, which is much
more scalable than traditional MCMC-based methods. The experiments on
real-world datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art
performances on both link prediction and community detection tasks while
learning interpretable node embeddings. The source code is available at

other under the condition of local observations. To solve such problems, many
multi-agent reinforcement learning methods based on Centralized Training with
Decentralized Execution have been proposed. One representative class of work is
value decomposition, which decomposes the global joint Q-value $Q_\text{jt}$
into individual Q-values $Q_a$ to guide individuals&#x27; behaviors, e.g. VDN
(Value-Decomposition Networks) and QMIX. However, these baselines often ignore
the randomness in the situation. We propose MMD-MIX, a method that combines
distributional reinforcement learning and value decomposition to alleviate the
above weaknesses. Besides, to improve data sampling efficiency, we were
inspired by REM (Random Ensemble Mixture) which is a robust RL algorithm to
explicitly introduce randomness into the MMD-MIX. The experiments demonstrate
that MMD-MIX outperforms prior baselines in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge

                                        <span>Treatment effect estimation from observational data is a fundamental problem
in causal inference. There are two very different schools of thought that have
tackled this problem. On the one hand, the Pearlian framework commonly assumes
structural knowledge (provided by an expert) in the form of Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs) and provides graphical criteria such as the back-door criterion
to identify the valid adjustment sets. On the other hand, the potential
outcomes (PO) framework commonly assumes that all the observed features satisfy
ignorability (i.e., no hidden confounding), which in general is untestable. In
this work, we take steps to bridge these two frameworks. We show that even if
we know only one parent of the treatment variable (provided by an expert), then
quite remarkably it suffices to test a broad class of (but not all) back-door
criteria. Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial case where the entire set
of observed features is not ignorable (generalizing the PO framework) without
requiring all the parents of the treatment variable to be observed. Our key
technical idea involves a more general result -- Given a synthetic sub-sampling
(or environment) variable that is a function of the parent variable, we show
that an invariance test involving this sub-sampling variable is equivalent to
testing a broad class of back-door criteria. We demonstrate our approach on
synthetic data as well as real causal effect estimation benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>In multi-label classification, where a single example may be associated with
several class labels at the same time, the ability to model dependencies
between labels is considered crucial to effectively optimize non-decomposable
evaluation measures, such as the Subset 0/1 loss. The gradient boosting
framework provides a well-studied foundation for learning models that are
specifically tailored to such a loss function and recent research attests the
ability to achieve high predictive accuracy in the multi-label setting. The
utilization of second-order derivatives, as used by many recent boosting
approaches, helps to guide the minimization of non-decomposable losses, due to
the information about pairs of labels it incorporates into the optimization
process. On the downside, this comes with high computational costs, even if the
number of labels is small. In this work, we address the computational
bottleneck of such approach -- the need to solve a system of linear equations
-- by integrating a novel approximation technique into the boosting procedure.
Based on the derivatives computed during training, we dynamically group the
labels into a predefined number of bins to impose an upper bound on the
dimensionality of the linear system. Our experiments, using an existing
rule-based algorithm, suggest that this may boost the speed of training,
without any significant loss in predictive performance.</span>

                                        <span>Adaptive gradient methods, such as \textsc{Adam}, have achieved tremendous
success in machine learning. Scaling gradients by square roots of the running
averages of squared past gradients, such methods are able to attain rapid
training of modern deep neural networks. Nevertheless, they are observed to
generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (\textsc{SGD}) and tend to be
trapped in local minima at an early stage during training. Intriguingly, we
discover that substituting the gradient in the preconditioner term with the
momentumized version in \textsc{Adam} can well solve the issues. The intuition
is that gradient with momentum contains more accurate directional information
and therefore its second moment estimation is a better choice for scaling than
raw gradient&#x27;s. Thereby we propose \textsc{AdaMomentum} as a new optimizer
reaching the goal of training faster while generalizing better. We further
develop a theory to back up the improvement in optimization and generalization
and provide convergence guarantee under both convex and nonconvex settings.
Extensive experiments on various models and tasks demonstrate that
\textsc{AdaMomentum} exhibits comparable performance to \textsc{SGD} on vision
tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results consistently on other tasks
including language processing.</span>

                                        <span>In high energy physics (HEP), jets are collections of correlated particles
produced ubiquitously in particle collisions such as those at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). Machine-learning-based generative models, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs), have the potential to significantly
accelerate LHC jet simulations. However, despite jets having a natural
representation as a set of particles in momentum-space, a.k.a. a particle
cloud, to our knowledge there exist no generative models applied to such a
dataset. We introduce a new particle cloud dataset (JetNet), and, due to
similarities between particle and point clouds, apply to it existing point
cloud GANs. Results are evaluated using (1) the 1-Wasserstein distance between
high- and low-level feature distributions, (2) a newly developed Fr\&#x27;{e}chet
ParticleNet Distance, and (3) the coverage and (4) minimum matching distance
metrics. Existing GANs are found to be inadequate for physics applications,
hence we develop a new message passing GAN (MPGAN), which outperforms existing
point cloud GANs on virtually every metric and shows promise for use in HEP. We
propose JetNet as a novel point-cloud-style dataset for the machine learning
community to experiment with, and set MPGAN as a benchmark to improve upon for
future generative models.</span>

                                        <span>A variety of wireless channel estimation methods, e.g., MUSIC and ESPRIT,
rely on prior knowledge of the model order. Therefore, it is important to
correctly estimate the number of multipath components (MPCs) which compose such
channels. However, environments with many scatterers may generate MPCs which
are closely spaced. This clustering of MPCs in addition to noise makes the
model order selection task difficult in practice to currently known algorithms.
In this paper, we exploit the multidimensional characteristics of MIMO
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and propose a machine
learning (ML) method capable of determining the number of MPCs with a higher
accuracy than state of the art methods in almost coherent scenarios. Moreover,
our results show that our proposed ML method has an enhanced reliability.</span>

classifiers are vulnerable against model extraction attacks. In model
extraction attacks, an adversary exploits the target classifier to create a
surrogate classifier imitating the target classifier with respect to some
criteria. In this paper, we investigate the hardness degree of samples and
demonstrate that the hardness degree histogram of model extraction attacks
samples is distinguishable from the hardness degree histogram of normal
samples. Normal samples come from the target classifier&#x27;s training data
distribution. As the training process of DNN-based classifiers is done in
several epochs, we can consider this process as a sequence of subclassifiers so
that each subclassifier is created at the end of an epoch. We use the sequence
of subclassifiers to calculate the hardness degree of samples. We investigate
the relation between hardness degree of samples and the trust in the classifier
outputs. We propose Hardness-Oriented Detection Approach (HODA) to detect the
sample sequences of model extraction attacks. The results demonstrate that HODA
can detect the sample sequences of model extraction attacks with a high success
rate by only watching 100 attack samples. We also investigate the hardness
degree of adversarial examples and indicate that the hardness degree histogram

normal samples.</span>

class of problems and the possible solutions to handle them. In Section 9.2, we

decision process (MDP), Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP),
but also two very important and widely used algorithms for RL, i.e. the

multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework. Section 9.3 focuses on some toy examples
to illustrate how the basic concepts of RL are employed in communication
systems. We present applications extracted from literature with simplified
system models using similar notation as in Section 9.2 of this Chapter. In
Section 9.3, we also focus on modeling RL problems, i.e. how action and state

technique widely used in the healthcare domain to extract valuable
health-related information, e.g., heart rate variability, blood pressure, and
respiration rate. PPG signals can easily be collected continuously and remotely
using portable wearable devices. However, these measuring devices are
vulnerable to motion artifacts caused by daily life activities. The most common
ways to eliminate motion artifacts use extra accelerometer sensors, which
suffer from two limitations: i) high power consumption and ii) the need to
integrate an accelerometer sensor in a wearable device (which is not required
in certain wearables). This paper proposes a low-power non-accelerometer-based
PPG motion artifacts removal method outperforming the accuracy of the existing
methods. We use Cycle Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct clean PPG
signals from noisy PPG signals. Our novel machine-learning-based technique
achieves 9.5 times improvement in motion artifact removal compared to the
state-of-the-art without using extra sensors such as an accelerometer.</span>

some recently proposed algorithms utilized variants of knowledge distillation
(KD) technique to tackle the problem, they only partially addressed the key
additional challenges in CISS that causes the catastrophic forgetting; i.e.,
the semantic drift of the background class and multi-label prediction issue. To
better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M
(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining
several techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we
make three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background
class to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone
network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling
to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny
exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and
stability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better
performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough and
extensive ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem
compared to the standard class-incremental learning for classification.</span>

                                        <span>Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine
learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve
the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning
rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective
adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer
problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic
momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. At the
same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by
using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in
estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated
BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still
achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ without large
batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm
(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our
methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of
adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum
and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence
analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel
optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel
optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.</span>

                                        <span>The optimal design of neural networks is a critical problem in many
applications. Here, we investigate how dynamical systems with polynomial
nonlinearities can inform the design of neural systems that seek to emulate
them. We propose a Learnability metric and its associated features to quantify
the near-equilibrium behavior of learning dynamics. Equating the Learnability
of neural systems with equivalent parameter estimation metric of the reference
system establishes bounds on network structure. In this way, norms from theory
provide a good first guess for neural structure, which may then further adapt
with data. The proposed approach neither requires training nor training data.
It reveals exact sizing for a class of neural networks with multiplicative
nodes that mimic continuous- or discrete-time polynomial dynamics. It also
provides relatively tight lower size bounds for classical feed-forward networks
that is consistent with simulated assessments.</span>

                                        <span>Logical relations widely exist in human activities. Human use them for making
judgement and decision according to various conditions, which are embodied in
the form of \emph{if-then} rules. As an important kind of cognitive
intelligence, it is prerequisite of representing and storing logical relations
rightly into computer systems so as to make automatic judgement and decision,
especially for high-risk domains like medical diagnosis. However, current
numeric ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models are good at perceptual
intelligence such as image recognition while they are not good at cognitive
intelligence such as logical representation, blocking the further application
of ANN. To solve it, researchers have tried to design logical ANN models to
represent and store logical relations. Although there are some advances in this
research area, recent works still have disadvantages because the structures of
these logical ANN models still don&#x27;t map more directly with logical relations
which will cause the corresponding logical relations cannot be read out from
their network structures. Therefore, in order to represent logical relations
more clearly by the neural network structure and to read out logical relations
from it, this paper proposes a novel logical ANN model by designing the new
logical neurons and links in demand of logical representation. Compared with
the recent works on logical ANN models, this logical ANN model has more clear
corresponding with logical relations using the more direct mapping method
herein, thus logical relations can be read out following the connection
patterns of the network structure. Additionally, less neurons are used.</span>

                                        <span>Place Recognition is a crucial capability for mobile robot localization and
navigation. Image-based or Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a challenging
problem as scene appearance and camera viewpoint can change significantly when
places are revisited. Recent VPR methods based on &#x60;&#x60;sequential
representations&#x27;&#x27; have shown promising results as compared to traditional
sequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to
these endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored
following the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However,
a key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation
always superior to an implicit &#x60;&#x60;spatial&#x27;&#x27; representation based on sequence of
RGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended
abstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a
similar &#x60;&#x60;metric span&#x27;&#x27; to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based
method (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and
showcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass,
the performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span.
These performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness
of input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot.
While a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two
different modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of
answering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to
several applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.

drawn from a known prior distribution, even when the support of the prior is
the entire space (rather than, say, sparse vectors). We show for Gaussian
measurements and \emph{any} prior distribution on the signal, that the
posterior sampling estimator achieves near-optimal recovery guarantees.
Moreover, this result is robust to model mismatch, as long as the distribution
estimate (e.g., from an invertible generative model) is close to the true
distribution in Wasserstein distance. We implement the posterior sampling
estimator for deep generative priors using Langevin dynamics, and empirically
find that it produces accurate estimates with more diversity than MAP.</span>

essential technique in continuous-time system identification. While many
deterministic learning algorithms have been designed based on numerical
integration via the adjoint method, many downstream tasks such as active
learning, exploration in reinforcement learning, robust control, or filtering
require accurate estimates of predictive uncertainties. In this work, we
propose a novel approach towards estimating epistemically uncertain neural
ODEs, avoiding the numerical integration bottleneck. Instead of modeling
uncertainty in the ODE parameters, we directly model uncertainties in the state
space. Our algorithm - distributional gradient matching (DGM) - jointly trains
a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a
Wasserstein loss. Our experiments show that, compared to traditional
approximate inference methods based on numerical integration, our approach is
faster to train, faster at predicting previously unseen trajectories, and in
the context of neural ODEs, significantly more accurate.</span>

                                        <span>Kernel segmentation aims at partitioning a data sequence into several
non-overlapping segments that may have nonlinear and complex structures. In
general, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial
constraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic
programming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements.
Given that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a
practical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to
approximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of
their solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate
the aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based
regularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining
it with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a
differentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization
(KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the
optimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed
model. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower
time and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform
segmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting
multiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to
further introduce an extended variant of the proposed model. Through extensive
experiments on various types of data sequences performances of our models are
evaluated and compared with those of the existing methods. The experimental
results validate advantages of the proposed models. Our Matlab source code is
available on github.</span>

gradient-descent to alternately optimize the supernet weights and the
architecture parameters through a bi-level optimization paradigm,
\textit{Differentiable ARchiTecture Search} (DARTS) has become the mainstream
method in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, more recent works found that the performance of the
searched architecture barely increases with the optimization proceeding in
DARTS. In addition, several concurrent works show that the NAS could find more
competitive architectures without labels. The above observations reveal that
the supervision signal in DARTS may be a poor indicator for architecture
optimization, inspiring a foundational question: instead of using the
supervision signal to perform bi-level optimization, \textit{can we find
high-quality architectures \textbf{without any training nor labels}}? We
provide an affirmative answer by customizing the NAS as a network pruning at
initialization problem. By leveraging recent techniques on the network pruning
at initialization, we designed a FreeFlow proxy to score the importance of
candidate operations in NAS without any training nor labels, and proposed a
novel framework called \textit{training and label free neural architecture
search} (\textbf{FreeNAS}) accordingly. We show that, without any training nor
labels, FreeNAS with the proposed FreeFlow proxy can outperform most NAS
baselines. More importantly, our framework is extremely efficient, which
completes the architecture search within only \textbf{3.6s} and \textbf{79s} on
a single GPU for the NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search space, respectively. We
hope our work inspires more attempts in solving NAS from the perspective of
pruning at initialization.</span>

semi-supervised learning, which is a learning scheme in which the scarce labels

assumption, and continuity assumption, the work reviews the recent
semi-supervised learning approaches. In particular, the methods in regard to

                                        <span>Coronary X-ray angiography is a crucial clinical procedure for the diagnosis
and treatment of coronary artery disease, which accounts for roughly 16% of
global deaths every year. However, the images acquired in these procedures have
low resolution and poor contrast, making lesion detection and assessment
challenging. Accurate coronary artery segmentation not only helps mitigate
these problems, but also allows the extraction of relevant anatomical features
for further analysis by quantitative methods. Although automated segmentation
of coronary arteries has been proposed before, previous approaches have used
non-optimal segmentation criteria, leading to less useful results. Most methods
either segment only the major vessel, discarding important information from the
remaining ones, or segment the whole coronary tree based mostly on contrast
information, producing a noisy output that includes vessels that are not
relevant for diagnosis. We adopt a better-suited clinical criterion and segment
vessels according to their clinical relevance. Additionally, we simultaneously
perform catheter segmentation, which may be useful for diagnosis due to the
scale factor provided by the catheter&#x27;s known diameter, and is a task that has
not yet been performed with good results. To derive the optimal approach, we
conducted an extensive comparative study of encoder-decoder architectures
trained on a combination of focal loss and a variant of generalized dice loss.
Based on the EfficientNet and the UNet++ architectures, we propose a line of
efficient and high-performance segmentation models using a new decoder
architecture, the EfficientUNet++, whose best-performing version achieved
average dice scores of 0.8904 and 0.7526 for the artery and catheter classes,
respectively, and an average generalized dice score of 0.9234.</span>

ranges of applications. However, it notoriously lacks data-efficiency and
interpretability. Data-efficiency is important as interacting with the
environment is expensive. Further, interpretability can increase the
transparency of the black-box-style deep RL models and hence gain trust from
the users. In this work, we propose a new hierarchical framework via symbolic
RL, leveraging a symbolic transition model to improve the data-efficiency and
introduce the interpretability for learned policy. This framework consists of a
high-level agent, a subtask solver and a symbolic transition model. Without
assuming any prior knowledge on the state transition, we adopt inductive logic
programming (ILP) to learn the rules of symbolic state transitions, introducing
interpretability and making the learned behavior understandable to users. In
empirical experiments, we confirmed that the proposed framework offers
approximately between 30\% to 40\% more data efficiency over previous methods.</span>

                                        <span>Top-down attention allows neural networks, both artificial and biological, to
focus on the information most relevant for a given task. This is known to
enhance performance in visual perception. But it remains unclear how attention
brings about its perceptual boost, especially when it comes to naturalistic
settings like recognising an object in an everyday scene. What aspects of a
visual task does attention help to deal with? We aim to answer this with a
computational experiment based on a general framework called task-oriented
ablation design. First we define a broad range of visual tasks and identify six
factors that underlie task variability. Then on each task we compare the
performance of two neural networks, one with top-down attention and one
without. These comparisons reveal the task-dependence of attention&#x27;s perceptual
boost, giving a clearer idea of the role attention plays. Whereas many existing
cognitive accounts link attention to stimulus-level variables, such as visual
clutter and object scale, we find greater explanatory power in system-level
variables that capture the interaction between the model, the distribution of
training data and the task format. This finding suggests a shift in how
attention is studied could be fruitful. We make publicly available our code and
results, along with statistics relevant to ImageNet-based experiments beyond
this one. Our contribution serves to support the development of more human-like
vision models and the design of more informative machine-learning experiments.</span>

through recommender systems like newsfeed. The focus of such recommender
systems has thus far been primarily on modeling the content consumer
preferences and optimizing for their experience. However, it is equally
critical to nurture content creation by prioritizing the creators&#x27; interests,
as quality content forms the seed for sustainable engagement and conversations,
bringing in new consumers while retaining existing ones. In this work, we
propose a modeling approach to predict how feedback from content consumers
incentivizes creators. We then leverage this model to optimize the newsfeed
experience for content creators by reshaping the feedback distribution, leading
to a more active content ecosystem. Practically, we discuss how we balance the
user experience for both consumers and creators, and how we carry out online
A/B tests with strong network effects. We present a deployed use case on the
LinkedIn newsfeed, where we used this approach to improve content creation
significantly without compromising the consumers&#x27; experience.</span>

Detecting moving objects can be posed as Moving Object Segmentation, by
segmenting the object pixels, or Moving Object Detection, by generating a
bounding box for the moving targets. In this paper, we present a Multi-Task
Learning architecture, based on Transformers, to jointly perform both tasks
through one network. Due to the importance of the motion features to the task,
the whole setup is based on a Spatio-Temporal aggregation. We evaluate the
performance of the individual tasks architecture versus the MTL setup, both
with early shared encoders, and late shared encoder-decoder transformers. For
the latter, we present a novel joint tasks query decoder transformer, that
enables us to have tasks dedicated heads out of the shared model. To evaluate
our approach, we use the KITTI MOD [29] data set. Results show1.5% mAP
improvement for Moving Object Detection, and 2%IoU improvement for Moving
Object Segmentation, over the individual tasks networks.</span>

                                        <span>This paper develops an efficient procedure for designing low-complexity
codebooks for precoding in a full-dimension (FD) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system with a uniform planar array (UPA) antenna at the transmitter (Tx)
using tensor learning. In particular, instead of using statistical channel
models, we utilize a model-free data-driven approach with foundations in
machine learning to generate codebooks that adapt to the surrounding
propagation conditions. We use a tensor representation of the FD-MIMO channel
and exploit its properties to design quantized version of the channel
precoders. We find the best representation of the optimal precoder as a
function of Kronecker Product (KP) of two low-dimensional precoders,
respectively corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the
UPA, obtained from the tensor decomposition of the channel. We then quantize
this precoder to design product codebooks such that an average loss in mutual
information due to quantization of channel state information (CSI) is
minimized. The key technical contribution lies in exploiting the constraints on
the precoders to reduce the product codebook design problem to an unsupervised
clustering problem on a Cartesian Product Grassmann manifold (CPM), where the
cluster centroids form a finite-sized precoder codebook. This codebook can be
found efficiently by running a $K$-means clustering on the CPM. With a suitable
induced distance metric on the CPM, we show that the construction of product
codebooks is equivalent to finding the optimal set of centroids on the factor
manifolds corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Simulation
results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed design
criterion in learning the codebooks and the attractive performance of the
designed codebooks.</span>

                                        <span>Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a crucial task for the Autonomous Driving
pipeline. MOD is usually handled via 2-stream convolutional architectures that
incorporates both appearance and motion cues, without considering the
inter-relations between the spatial or motion features. In this paper, we
tackle this problem through multi-head attention mechanisms, both across the
spatial and motion streams. We propose MODETR; a Moving Object DEtection
TRansformer network, comprised of multi-stream transformer encoders for both
spatial and motion modalities, and an object transformer decoder that produces
the moving objects bounding boxes using set predictions. The whole architecture
is trained end-to-end using bi-partite loss. Several methods of incorporating
motion cues with the Transformer model are explored, including two-stream RGB
and Optical Flow (OF) methods, and multi-stream architectures that take
advantage of sequence information. To incorporate the temporal information, we
propose a new Temporal Positional Encoding (TPE) approach to extend the Spatial
Positional Encoding(SPE) in DETR. We explore two architectural choices for
that, balancing between speed and time. To evaluate the our network, we perform
the MOD task on the KITTI MOD [6] data set. Results show significant 5% mAP of
the Transformer network for MOD over the state-of-the art methods. Moreover,
the proposed TPE encoding provides 10% mAP improvement over the SPE baseline.</span>

                                        <span>In the text processing context, most ML models are built on word embeddings.
These embeddings are themselves trained on some datasets, potentially
containing sensitive data. In some cases this training is done independently,
in other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In
either case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based
on the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage.
But, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and
their effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these
embeddings, have remained relatively unexplored.

In this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box
membership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show
that this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications:
classification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not
exposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack
accuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model. Indeed,
our attack is a cheaper membership inference attack on text-generative models,
which does not require the knowledge of the target model or any expensive
training of text-generative models as shadow models.</span>

challenges. In this work, we propose mathematically provable Representer
Sketch, a concise set of count arrays that can approximate the inference
procedure with simple hashing computations and aggregations. Representer Sketch
builds upon the popular Representer Theorem from kernel literature, hence the
name, providing a generic fundamental alternative to the problem of efficient
inference that goes beyond the popular approach such as quantization, iterative
pruning and knowledge distillation. A neural network function is transformed to
its weighted kernel density representation, which can be very efficiently
estimated with our sketching algorithm. Empirically, we show that Representer
Sketch achieves up to 114x reduction in storage requirement and 59x reduction

                                        <span>We study mean-field variational Bayesian inference using the TAP approach,
for Z2-synchronization as a prototypical example of a high-dimensional Bayesian
model. We show that for any signal strength $\lambda &gt; 1$ (the weak-recovery
threshold), there exists a unique local minimizer of the TAP free energy
functional near the mean of the Bayes posterior law. Furthermore, the TAP free
energy in a local neighborhood of this minimizer is strongly convex.
Consequently, a natural-gradient/mirror-descent algorithm achieves linear
convergence to this minimizer from a local initialization, which may be
obtained by a finite number of iterates of Approximate Message Passing (AMP).
This provides a rigorous foundation for variational inference in high
dimensions via minimization of the TAP free energy.

We also analyze the finite-sample convergence of AMP, showing that AMP is
asymptotically stable at the TAP minimizer for any $\lambda &gt; 1$, and is
linearly convergent to this minimizer from a spectral initialization for
sufficiently large $\lambda$. Such a guarantee is stronger than results
obtainable by state evolution analyses, which only describe a fixed number of
AMP iterations in the infinite-sample limit.

Our proofs combine the Kac-Rice formula and Sudakov-Fernique Gaussian
comparison inequality to analyze the complexity of critical points that satisfy
strong convexity and stability conditions within their local neighborhoods.</span>

                                        <span>The study of provable adversarial robustness for deep neural network (DNN)
models has mainly focused on static supervised learning tasks such as image
classification. However, DNNs have been used extensively in real-world adaptive
tasks such as reinforcement learning (RL), making RL systems vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. The key challenge in adversarial RL is that the attacker
can adapt itself to the defense strategy used by the agent in previous
time-steps to strengthen its attack in future steps. In this work, we study the
provable robustness of RL against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations of the
inputs. We focus on smoothing-based provable defenses and propose policy
smoothing where the agent adds a Gaussian noise to its observation at each
time-step before applying the policy network to make itself less sensitive to
adversarial perturbations of its inputs. Our main theoretical contribution is
to prove an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma where the adversarial
perturbation at a particular time can be a stochastic function of current and
previous observations and states as well as previously observed actions. Using
this lemma, we adapt the robustness certificates produced by randomized
smoothing in the static setting of image classification to the dynamic setting
of RL. We generate certificates that guarantee that the total reward obtained
by the smoothed policy will not fall below a certain threshold under a
norm-bounded adversarial perturbation of the input. We show that our
certificates are tight by constructing a worst-case setting that achieves the
bounds derived in our analysis. In our experiments, we show that this method
can yield meaningful certificates in complex environments demonstrating its
effectiveness against adversarial attacks.</span>

follow with a thorough analysis of 27 state-of-the-art summarization models and
5 popular metrics, and report our key insights: (1) Datasets have distinct data
quality and complexity distributions, which can be traced back to their

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation is used in many machine learning applications
where, during training, a model has access to unlabeled data in the target
domain, and a related labeled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel and
general domain-adversarial framework. Specifically, we derive a novel
generalization bound for domain adaptation that exploits a new measure of
discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of
f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al.
(2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based on
this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key
correction in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016).
We show that many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last
years in this framework are then not required to achieve performance comparable
to (if not better than) state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods.
Experimental analysis conducted on real-world natural language and computer
vision datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baselines, and
obtains the best results for f-divergences that were not considered previously
in domain-adversarial learning.</span>

end-to-end pipeline and competitive results on several fundamental computer
vision tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation. However, how to establish a query based video instance
segmentation (VIS) framework with elegant architecture and strong performance
remains to be settled. In this paper, we present \textbf{QueryTrack} (i.e.,
tracking instances as queries), a unified query based VIS framework fully
leveraging the intrinsic one-to-one correspondence between instances and
queries in QueryInst. The proposed method obtains 52.7 / 52.3 AP on
YouTube-VIS-2019 / 2021 datasets, which wins the 2-nd place in the YouTube-VIS
Challenge at CVPR 2021 \textbf{with a single online end-to-end model, single
scale testing \&amp; modest amount of training data}. We also provide
QueryTrack-ResNet-50 baseline results on YouTube-VIS-2021 dataset as references

performance in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, they are
computationally expensive to be deployed in real-time applications. A typical
method is to adopt knowledge distillation to compress these large pre-trained
models (teacher models) to small student models. However, for a target domain
with scarce training data, the teacher can hardly pass useful knowledge to the
student, which yields performance degradation for the student models. To tackle
this problem, we propose a method to learn to augment for data-scarce domain
BERT knowledge distillation, by learning a cross-domain manipulation scheme
that automatically augments the target with the help of resource-rich source
domains. Specifically, the proposed method generates samples acquired from a
stationary distribution near the target data and adopts a reinforced selector
to automatically refine the augmentation strategy according to the performance
of the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four different tasks,
and for the data-scarce domains, the compressed student models even perform
better than the original large teacher model, with much fewer parameters (only
${\sim}13.3\%$) when only a few labeled examples available.</span>

Transformer layers to propagate information across longer distances. To provide

                                        <span>We investigate the problem of Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) and
present a new framework named Tail-to-Tail (\textbf{TtT}) non-autoregressive
sequence prediction to address the deep issues hidden in CGEC. Considering that
most tokens are correct and can be conveyed directly from source to target, and
the error positions can be estimated and corrected based on the bidirectional
context information, thus we employ a BERT-initialized Transformer Encoder as
the backbone model to conduct information modeling and conveying. Considering
that only relying on the same position substitution cannot handle the
variable-length correction cases, various operations such substitution,
deletion, insertion, and local paraphrasing are required jointly. Therefore, a
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is stacked on the up tail to conduct
non-autoregressive sequence prediction by modeling the token dependencies.
Since most tokens are correct and easily to be predicted/conveyed to the
target, then the models may suffer from a severe class imbalance issue. To
alleviate this problem, focal loss penalty strategies are integrated into the
loss functions. Moreover, besides the typical fix-length error correction
datasets, we also construct a variable-length corpus to conduct experiments.
Experimental results on standard datasets, especially on the variable-length
datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of TtT in terms of sentence-level
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Measure on tasks of error Detection and
Correction.</span>

classification task, can deal with nested entities naturally. But they suffer
from the huge search space and the lack of interactions between entities. To
address these issues, we propose a novel sequence-to-set neural network for
nested NER. Instead of specifying candidate spans in advance, we provide a
fixed set of learnable vectors to learn the patterns of the valuable spans. We
utilize a non-autoregressive decoder to predict the final set of entities in
one pass, in which we are able to capture dependencies between entities.
Compared with the sequence-to-sequence method, our model is more suitable for
such unordered recognition task as it is insensitive to the label order. In
addition, we utilize the loss function based on bipartite matching to compute
the overall training loss. Experimental results show that our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art on three nested NER corpora: ACE 2004, ACE 2005 and
KBP 2017. The code is available at

                                        <span>Learning to capture text-table alignment is essential for tasks like
text-to-SQL. A model needs to correctly recognize natural language references
to columns and values and to ground them in the given database schema. In this
paper, we present a novel weakly supervised Structure-Grounded pretraining
framework (StruG) for text-to-SQL that can effectively learn to capture
text-table alignment based on a parallel text-table corpus. We identify a set
of novel prediction tasks: column grounding, value grounding and column-value
mapping, and leverage them to pretrain a text-table encoder. Additionally, to
evaluate different methods under more realistic text-table alignment settings,
we create a new evaluation set Spider-Realistic based on Spider dev set with
explicit mentions of column names removed, and adopt eight existing text-to-SQL
datasets for cross-database evaluation. STRUG brings significant improvement
over BERT-LARGE in all settings. Compared with existing pretraining methods
such as GRAPPA, STRUG achieves similar performance on Spider, and outperforms
all baselines on more realistic sets. All the code and data used in this work
is public available at https://aka.ms/strug.</span>

limited accuracy costs, by replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple
linear transformations that &quot;mix&quot; input tokens. These linear transformations,
along with standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at
modeling semantic relationships in several text classification tasks. Most
surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a
Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves
92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains
nearly seven times faster on GPUs and twice as fast on TPUs. The resulting
model, FNet, also scales very efficiently to long inputs. Specifically, when
compared to the &quot;efficient&quot; Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark,
FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, but is faster than the
fastest models across all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively
shorter lengths on TPUs). Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint and is
particularly efficient at smaller model sizes: for a fixed speed and accuracy
budget, small FNet models outperform Transformer counterparts.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, there has been significant progress in studying neural networks to
translate text descriptions into SQL queries. Despite achieving good
performance on some public benchmarks, existing text-to-SQL models typically
rely on the lexical matching between words in natural language (NL) questions
and tokens in table schemas, which may render the models vulnerable to attacks
that break the schema linking mechanism. In this work, we investigate the
robustness of text-to-SQL models to synonym substitution. In particular, we
introduce Spider-Syn, a human-curated dataset based on the Spider benchmark for
text-to-SQL translation. NL questions in Spider-Syn are modified from Spider,
by replacing their schema-related words with manually selected synonyms that
reflect real-world question paraphrases. We observe that the accuracy
dramatically drops by eliminating such explicit correspondence between NL
questions and table schemas, even if the synonyms are not adversarially
selected to conduct worst-case adversarial attacks. Finally, we present two
categories of approaches to improve the model robustness. The first category of
approaches utilizes additional synonym annotations for table schemas by
modifying the model input, while the second category is based on adversarial
training. We demonstrate that both categories of approaches significantly
outperform their counterparts without the defense, and the first category of
approaches are more effective.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, considerable literature has grown up around the theme of few-shot
named entity recognition (NER), but little published benchmark data
specifically focused on the practical and challenging task. Current approaches
collect existing supervised NER datasets and re-organize them to the few-shot
setting for empirical study. These strategies conventionally aim to recognize
coarse-grained entity types with few examples, while in practice, most unseen
entity types are fine-grained. In this paper, we present Few-NERD, a
large-scale human-annotated few-shot NER dataset with a hierarchy of 8
coarse-grained and 66 fine-grained entity types. Few-NERD consists of 188,238
sentences from Wikipedia, 4,601,160 words are included and each is annotated as
context or a part of a two-level entity type. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first few-shot NER dataset and the largest human-crafted NER
dataset. We construct benchmark tasks with different emphases to
comprehensively assess the generalization capability of models. Extensive
empirical results and analysis show that Few-NERD is challenging and the
problem requires further research. We make Few-NERD public at

                                        <span>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment
expressed in a review with respect to a given aspect. The core of ABSA is to
model the interaction between the context and given aspect to extract the
aspect-related information. In prior work, attention mechanisms and dependency
graph networks are commonly adopted to capture the relations between the
context and given aspect. And the weighted sum of context hidden states is used
as the final representation fed to the classifier. However, the information
related to the given aspect may be already discarded and adverse information
may be retained in the context modeling processes of existing models. This
problem cannot be solved by subsequent modules and there are two reasons:
first, their operations are conducted on the encoder-generated context hidden
states, whose value cannot change after the encoder; second, existing encoders
only consider the context while not the given aspect. To address this problem,
we argue the given aspect should be considered as a new clue out of context in
the context modeling process. As for solutions, we design several aspect-aware
context encoders based on different backbones: an aspect-aware LSTM and three
aspect-aware BERTs. They are dedicated to generate aspect-aware hidden states
which are tailored for ABSA task. In these aspect-aware context encoders, the
semantics of the given aspect is used to regulate the information flow.
Consequently, the aspect-related information can be retained and
aspect-irrelevant information can be excluded in the generated hidden states.
We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets with empirical
analysis, demonstrating the efficacies and advantages of our proposed
aspect-aware context encoders.</span>

                                        <span>The flexibility of the inference process in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
has recently led to revising traditional probabilistic topic models giving rise
to Neural Topic Models (NTMs). Although these approaches have achieved
significant results, surprisingly very little work has been done on how to
disentangle the latent topics. Existing topic models when applied to reviews
may extract topics associated with writers&#x27; subjective opinions mixed with
those related to factual descriptions such as plot summaries in movie and book
reviews. It is thus desirable to automatically separate opinion topics from
plot/neutral ones enabling a better interpretability. In this paper, we propose
a neural topic model combined with adversarial training to disentangle opinion
topics from plot and neutral ones. We conduct an extensive experimental
assessment introducing a new collection of movie and book reviews paired with
their plots, namely MOBO dataset, showing an improved coherence and variety of
topics, a consistent disentanglement rate, and sentiment classification
performance superior to other supervised topic models.</span>

                                        <span>Summarization has usually relied on gold standard summaries to train
extractive or abstractive models. Social media brings a hurdle to summarization
techniques since it requires addressing a multi-document multi-author approach.
We address this challenging task by introducing a novel method that generates
abstractive summaries of online news discussions. Our method extends a
BERT-based architecture, including an attention encoding that fed comments&#x27;
likes during the training stage. To train our model, we define a task which
consists of reconstructing high impact comments based on popularity (likes).
Accordingly, our model learns to summarize online discussions based on their
most relevant comments. Our novel approach provides a summary that represents
the most relevant aspects of a news item that users comment on, incorporating
the social context as a source of information to summarize texts in online
social networks. Our model is evaluated using ROUGE scores between the
generated summary and each comment on the thread. Our model, including the
social attention encoding, significantly outperforms both extractive and
abstractive summarization methods based on such evaluation.</span>

                                        <span>Fact-based Visual Question Answering (FVQA), a challenging variant of VQA,
requires a QA-system to include facts from a diverse knowledge graph (KG) in
its reasoning process to produce an answer. Large KGs, especially common-sense
KGs, are known to be incomplete, i.e., not all non-existent facts are always
incorrect. Therefore, being able to reason over incomplete KGs for QA is a
critical requirement in real-world applications that has not been addressed
extensively in the literature. We develop a novel QA architecture that allows
us to reason over incomplete KGs, something current FVQA state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches lack due to their critical reliance on fact retrieval. We use
KG Embeddings, a technique widely used for KG completion, for the downstream
task of FVQA. We also employ a new image representation technique we call
&#x27;Image-as-Knowledge&#x27; to enable this capability, alongside a simple one-step
CoAttention mechanism to attend to text and image during QA. Our FVQA
architecture is faster during inference time, being O(m), as opposed to
existing FVQA SOTA methods which are O(N log N), where m &#x3D; number of vertices,
N &#x3D; number of edges &#x3D; O(m^2). KG embeddings are shown to hold complementary
information to word embeddings: a combination of both metrics permits
performance comparable to SOTA methods in the standard answer retrieval task,
and significantly better (26% absolute) in the proposed missing-edge reasoning
task.</span>

                                        <span>Speaker diarization is a task to label audio or video recordings with classes
that correspond to speaker identity, or in short, a task to identify &quot;who spoke
when&quot;. In the early years, speaker diarization algorithms were developed for
speech recognition on multispeaker audio recordings to enable speaker adaptive
processing. These algorithms also gained their own value as a standalone
application over time to provide speaker-specific metainformation for
downstream tasks such as audio retrieval. More recently, with the emergence of
deep learning technology, which has driven revolutionary changes in research
and practices across speech application domains, rapid advancements have been
made for speaker diarization. In this paper, we review not only the historical
development of speaker diarization technology but also the recent advancements
in neural speaker diarization approaches. Furthermore, we discuss how speaker
diarization systems have been integrated with speech recognition applications
and how the recent surge of deep learning is leading the way of jointly
modeling these two components to be complementary to each other. By considering
such exciting technical trends, we believe that this paper is a valuable
contribution to the community to provide a survey work by consolidating the
recent developments with neural methods and thus facilitating further progress
toward a more efficient speaker diarization.</span>

                                        <span>With recent advances in distantly supervised (DS) relation extraction (RE),
considerable attention is attracted to leverage multi-instance learning (MIL)
to distill high-quality supervision from the noisy DS. Here, we go beyond label
noise and identify the key bottleneck of DS-MIL to be its low data utilization:
as high-quality supervision being refined by MIL, MIL abandons a large amount
of training instances, which leads to a low data utilization and hinders model
training from having abundant supervision. In this paper, we propose
collaborative adversarial training to improve the data utilization, which
coordinates virtual adversarial training (VAT) and adversarial training (AT) at
different levels. Specifically, since VAT is label-free, we employ the
instance-level VAT to recycle instances abandoned by MIL. Besides, we deploy AT
at the bag-level to unleash the full potential of the high-quality supervision
got by MIL. Our proposed method brings consistent improvements (~ 5 absolute
AUC score) to the previous state of the art, which verifies the importance of
the data utilization issue and the effectiveness of our method.</span>

that finds subtle clues to identify the syntactical and semantically correct
but not well-supported claims. This paper presents Kernel Graph Attention
Network (KGAT), which conducts more fine-grained fact verification with
kernel-based attentions. Given a claim and a set of potential evidence
sentences that form an evidence graph, KGAT introduces node kernels, which
better measure the importance of the evidence node, and edge kernels, which
conduct fine-grained evidence propagation in the graph, into Graph Attention
Networks for more accurate fact verification. KGAT achieves a 70.38% FEVER
score and significantly outperforms existing fact verification models on FEVER,
a large-scale benchmark for fact verification. Our analyses illustrate that,
compared to dot-product attentions, the kernel-based attention concentrates
more on relevant evidence sentences and meaningful clues in the evidence graph,
which is the main source of KGAT&#x27;s effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>The Grammar of Institutions, or Institutional Grammar, is an established
approach to encode policy information in terms of institutional statements
based on a set of pre-defined syntactic components. This codebook provides
coding guidelines for a revised version of the Institutional Grammar, the
Institutional Grammar 2.0 (IG 2.0). IG 2.0 is a specification that aims at
facilitating the encoding of policy to meet varying analytical objectives. To
this end, it revises the grammar with respect to comprehensiveness,
flexibility, and specificity by offering multiple levels of expressiveness (IG
Core, IG Extended, IG Logico). In addition to the encoding of regulative
statements, it further introduces the encoding of constitutive institutional
statements, as well as statements that exhibit both constitutive and regulative
characteristics. Introducing those aspects, the codebook initially covers
fundamental concepts of IG 2.0, before providing an overview of pre-coding
steps relevant for document preparation. Detailed coding guidelines are
provided for both regulative and constitutive statements across all levels of
expressiveness, along with the encoding guidelines for statements of mixed form
-- hybrid and polymorphic institutional statements. The document further
provides an overview of taxonomies used in the encoding process and referred to
throughout the codebook. The codebook concludes with a summary and discussion
of relevant considerations to facilitate the coding process. An initial
Reader&#x27;s Guide helps the reader tailor the content to her interest.

Note that this codebook specifically focuses on operational aspects of IG 2.0
in the context of policy coding. Links to additional resources such as the
underlying scientific literature (that offers a comprehensive treatment of the
underlying theoretical concepts) are referred to in the concluding section of
the codebook.</span>

identity signals from multilingual embeddings. We examine three approaches for
this: (i) re-aligning the vector spaces of target languages (all together) to a
pivot source language; (ii) removing language-specific means and variances,
which yields better discriminativeness of embeddings as a by-product; and (iii)
increasing input similarity across languages by removing morphological
contractions and sentence reordering. We evaluate on XNLI and reference-free MT
across 19 typologically diverse languages. Our findings expose the limitations
of these approaches -- unlike vector normalization, vector space re-alignment
and text normalization do not achieve consistent gains across encoders and
languages. Due to the approaches&#x27; additive effects, their combination decreases
the cross-lingual transfer gap by 8.9 points (m-BERT) and 18.2 points (XLM-R)
on average across all tasks and languages, however. Our code and models are
publicly available.</span>

body text, etc.-is a critical first step in automated scientific document
understanding. Previous work has shown how using elementary layout information,
i.e., each token&#x27;s 2D position on the page, leads to more accurate
classification. We introduce new methods for incorporating VIsual LAyout (VILA)
structures, e.g., the grouping of page texts into text lines or text blocks,
into language models to further improve performance. We show that the I-VILA
approach, which simply adds special tokens denoting the boundaries of layout
structures into model inputs, can lead to 1.9% Macro F1 improvements for token
classification. Moreover, we design a hierarchical model, H-VILA, that encodes
the text based on layout structures and record an up-to 47% inference time
reduction with less than 1.5% Macro F1 loss for the text classification models.
Experiments are conducted on a newly curated evaluation suite, S2-VLUE, with a
novel metric measuring classification uniformity within visual groups and a new
dataset of gold annotations covering papers from 19 scientific disciplines.

                                        <span>Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand
visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., &#x60;yeah&#x27; and &#x60;yes&#x27;). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as &#x60;I don&#x27;t know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG
state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won
the recent Visual Dialog 2020 challenge. Source code is available at

mimic the n-gram sequences in the training set with training objectives like
negative log-likelihood (NLL) or cross-entropy. Such commonly used training
objectives do not foster generating alternate responses to a context. But, the
effects of minimizing an alternate training objective that fosters a model to
generate alternate response and score it on semantic similarity has not been
well studied. We hypothesize that a language generation model can improve on
its diversity by learning to generate alternate text during training and
minimizing a semantic loss as an auxiliary objective. We explore this idea on
two different sized data sets on the task of next utterance generation in goal
oriented dialogues. We make two observations (1) minimizing a semantic
objective improved diversity in responses in the smaller data set (Frames) but
only as-good-as minimizing the NLL in the larger data set (MultiWoZ) (2) large
language model embeddings can be more useful as a semantic loss objective than
as initialization for token embeddings.</span>

natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). The paradigm
pretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the
speech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the
paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal
PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the
performance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks
with minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of
the shared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned
from SSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to
solve SUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on
top of the frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is
promising as SSL representations show competitive generalizability and
accessibility across SUPERB tasks. We release SUPERB as a challenge with a
leaderboard and a benchmark toolkit to fuel the research in representation
learning and general speech processing.</span>

real-world problems that remained unsolved for more than a decade. Automatic
caption generation is a major research field, and the research community has
done a lot of work on it in most common languages like English. Urdu is the
national language of Pakistan and also much spoken and understood in the
sub-continent region of Pakistan-India, and yet no work has been done for Urdu
language caption generation. Our research aims to fill this gap by developing
an attention-based deep learning model using techniques of sequence modeling
specialized for the Urdu language. We have prepared a dataset in the Urdu
language by translating a subset of the &quot;Flickr8k&quot; dataset containing 700 &#x27;man&#x27;
images. We evaluate our proposed technique on this dataset and show that it can
achieve a BLEU score of 0.83 in the Urdu language. We improve on the previous
state-of-the-art by using better CNN architectures and optimization techniques.
Furthermore, we provide a discussion on how the generated captions can be made
correct grammar-wise.</span>

recognition using small or under-resourced datasets. This method requires less
data than other SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) methods, e.g. the Angular Prototypical
and GE2E loss functions, while achieving similar results to those methods. This
is done using the knowledge of the reconstruction of a phoneme in the speaker&#x27;s
voice. For this purpose, a new dataset was built, composed of 40 male speakers,
who read sentences in Portuguese, totaling approximately 3h. We compare the
three best architectures trained using our method to select the best one, which
is the one with a shallow architecture. Then, we compared this model with the
SOTA method for the speaker recognition task: the Fast ResNet-34 trained with
approximately 2,000 hours, using the loss functions Angular Prototypical and
GE2E. Three experiments were carried out with datasets in different languages.
Among these three experiments, our model achieved the second best result in two
experiments and the best result in one of them. This highlights the importance
of our method, which proved to be a great competitor to SOTA speaker
recognition models, with 500x less data and a simpler approach.</span>

distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However,
it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing
cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of
its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like
racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a
machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the
first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online
antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting

multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any
publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect
and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and
Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that
detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism
category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of
experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.</span>

across cohorts have focused on data augmentation, debiasing model embeddings,
or adding fairness-based optimization objectives during training. Separately,
certified word substitution robustness methods have been developed to decrease
the impact of spurious features and synonym substitutions on model predictions.
While their end goals are different, they both aim to encourage models to make
the same prediction for certain changes in the input. In this paper, we
investigate the utility of certified word substitution robustness methods to
improve equality of odds and equality of opportunity on multiple text
classification tasks. We observe that certified robustness methods improve
fairness, and using both robustness and bias mitigation methods in training
results in an improvement in both fronts</span>

                                        <span>Dialogue relation extraction (DRE) aims to detect the relation between two
entities mentioned in a multi-party dialogue. It plays an important role in
constructing knowledge graphs from conversational data increasingly abundant on
the internet and facilitating intelligent dialogue system development. The
prior methods of DRE do not meaningfully leverage speaker information-they just
prepend the utterances with the respective speaker names. Thus, they fail to
model the crucial inter-speaker relations that may give additional context to
relevant argument entities through pronouns and triggers. We, however, present
a graph attention network-based method for DRE where a graph, that contains
meaningfully connected speaker, entity, entity-type, and utterance nodes, is
constructed. This graph is fed to a graph attention network for context
propagation among relevant nodes, which effectively captures the dialogue
context. We empirically show that this graph-based approach quite effectively
captures the relations between different entity pairs in a dialogue as it
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin on the
benchmark dataset DialogRE. Our code is released at:

of algorithmic approaches and software. This paper introduces infrastructure
and methodologies for text classifiers based on large-scale regular
expressions. In particular, we describe how Facebook determines if a given
piece of text - anything from a hashtag to a post - belongs to a narrow topic
such as COVID-19. To fully define a topic and evaluate classifier performance
we employ human-guided iterations of keyword discovery, but do not require
labeled data. For COVID-19, we build two sets of regular expressions: (1) for
66 languages, with 99% precision and recall &gt;50%, (2) for the 11 most common
languages, with precision &gt;90% and recall &gt;90%. Regular expressions enable
low-latency queries from multiple platforms. Response to challenges like
COVID-19 is fast and so are revisions. Comparisons to a DNN classifier show
explainable results, higher precision and recall, and less overfitting. Our
learnings can be applied to other narrow-topic classifiers.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, there are many applications of text mining over corpora from
different languages. However, most of them are based on texts in prose, lacking
applications that work with poetry texts. An example of an application of text
mining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual words
in order to capture the lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer
the General Affective Meaning (GAM) of the text. However, even though this
proposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there is a
lack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic
compositions such as sonnets. This article presents a study over an annotated
corpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse if it is possible to build
features from their individual words for predicting their GAM. The purpose of
this is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the
relationship between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this,
we consider the content from a psychological perspective, identifying with tags
when a sonnet is related to a specific term. Then, we study how GAM changes
according to each of those psychological terms.

The corpus used contains 274 Spanish sonnets from authors of different
centuries, from 15th to 19th. This corpus was annotated by different domain
experts. The experts annotated the poems with affective and lexico-semantic
features, as well as with domain concepts that belong to psychology. Thanks to
this, the corpus of sonnets can be used in different applications, such as
poetry recommender systems, personality text mining studies of the authors, or
the usage of poetry for therapeutic purposes.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic generation of high-quality commit messages for code commits can
substantially facilitate software developers&#x27; works and coordination. However,
the semantic gap between source code and natural language poses a major
challenge for the task. Several studies have been proposed to alleviate the
challenge but none explicitly involves code contextual information during
commit message generation. Specifically, existing research adopts static
embedding for code tokens, which maps a token to the same vector regardless of
its context. In this paper, we propose a novel Contextualized code
representation learning strategy for commit message Generation (CoreGen).
CoreGen first learns contextualized code representations which exploit the
contextual information behind code commit sequences. The learned
representations of code commits built upon Transformer are then fine-tuned for
downstream commit message generation. Experiments on the benchmark dataset
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our model over the baseline models
with at least 28.18% improvement in terms of BLEU-4 score. Furthermore, we also
highlight the future opportunities in training contextualized code
representations on larger code corpus as a solution to low-resource tasks and
adapting the contextualized code representation framework to other code-to-text
generation tasks.</span>

a screen. In the literature, there are many offline datasets collected with a
diversity of Arabic styles for calligraphy. However, there is no available

                                        <span>Natural reading orders of words are crucial for information extraction from
form-like documents. Despite recent advances in Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) on modeling spatial layout patterns of documents, they have limited
ability to capture reading orders of given word-level node representations in a
graph. We propose Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding (ROPE), a new
positional encoding technique designed to apprehend the sequential presentation
of words in documents. ROPE generates unique reading order codes for
neighboring words relative to the target word given a word-level graph
connectivity. We study two fundamental document entity extraction tasks
including word labeling and word grouping on the public FUNSD dataset and a
large-scale payment dataset. We show that ROPE consistently improves existing
GCNs with a margin up to 8.4% F1-score.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, the size of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has grown by
leaps and bounds. However, efficiency issues of these large-scale PLMs limit
their utilization in real-world scenarios. We present a suite of cost-effective
techniques for the use of PLMs to deal with the efficiency issues of
pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. (1) We introduce knowledge
inheritance to accelerate the pre-training process by exploiting existing PLMs
instead of training models from scratch. (2) We explore the best practice of
prompt tuning with large-scale PLMs. Compared with conventional fine-tuning,
prompt tuning significantly reduces the number of task-specific parameters. (3)
We implement a new inference toolkit, namely InfMoE, for using large-scale PLMs
with limited computational resources. Based on our cost-effective pipeline, we
pre-train two models: an encoder-decoder bilingual model with 11 billion
parameters (CPM-2) and its corresponding MoE version with 198 billion
parameters. In our experiments, we compare CPM-2 with mT5 on downstream tasks.
Experimental results show that CPM-2 has excellent general language
intelligence. Moreover, we validate the efficiency of InfMoE when conducting
inference of large-scale models having tens of billions of parameters on a
single GPU. All source code and model parameters are available at

                                        <span>Although emotions are universal concepts, transferring the different shades
of emotion from one language to another may not always be straightforward for
human translators, let alone for machine translation systems. Moreover, the
cognitive states are established by verbal explanations of experience which is
shaped by both the verbal and cultural contexts. There are a number of verbal
contexts where expression of emotions constitutes the pivotal component of the
message. This is particularly true for User-Generated Content (UGC) which can
be in the form of a review of a product or a service, a tweet, or a social
media post. Recently, it has become common practice for multilingual websites
such as Twitter to provide an automatic translation of UGC to reach out to
their linguistically diverse users. In such scenarios, the process of
translating the user&#x27;s emotion is entirely automatic with no human
intervention, neither for post-editing nor for accuracy checking. In this
research, we assess whether automatic translation tools can be a successful
real-life utility in transferring emotion in user-generated multilingual data
such as tweets. We show that there are linguistic phenomena specific of Twitter
data that pose a challenge in translation of emotions in different languages.
We summarise these challenges in a list of linguistic features and show how
frequent these features are in different language pairs. We also assess the
capacity of commonly used methods for evaluating the performance of an MT
system with respect to the preservation of emotion in the source text.</span>

authority to cite while drafting decisions. In this paper, we develop a
citation recommendation tool that can help improve efficiency in the process of
opinion drafting. We train four types of machine learning models, including a
citation-list based method (collaborative filtering) and three context-based
methods (text similarity, BiLSTM and RoBERTa classifiers). Our experiments show
that leveraging local textual context improves recommendation, and that deep
neural models achieve decent performance. We show that non-deep text-based
methods benefit from access to structured case metadata, but deep models only
benefit from such access when predicting from context of insufficient length.
We also find that, even after extensive training, RoBERTa does not outperform a
recurrent neural model, despite its benefits of pretraining. Our behavior
analysis of the RoBERTa model further shows that predictive performance is
stable across time and citation classes.</span>

anxiety disorders. It has been documented that there are significant
differences in the language used by a person with emotional disorders in
comparison to a healthy individual. Still, the effectiveness of these lexical
approaches could be improved further because the current analysis focuses on
what the social media entries are about, and not how they are written. In this
study, we focus on aspects in which these short texts are similar to each
other, and how they were created. We present an innovative approach to the
depression screening problem by applying Collgram analysis, which is a known
effective method of obtaining linguistic information from texts. We compare
these results with sentiment analysis based on the BERT architecture. Finally,
we create a hybrid model achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 71%.</span>

                                        <span>Select-then-compress is a popular hybrid, framework for text summarization
due to its high efficiency. This framework first selects salient sentences and
then independently condenses each of the selected sentences into a concise
version. However, compressing sentences separately ignores the context
information of the document, and is therefore prone to delete salient
information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
condense-then-select framework for text summarization. Our framework first
concurrently condenses each document sentence. Original document sentences and
their compressed versions then become the candidates for extraction. Finally,
an extractor utilizes the context information of the document to select
candidates and assembles them into a summary. If salient information is deleted
during condensing, the extractor can select an original sentence to retain the
information. Thus, our framework helps to avoid the loss of salient
information, while preserving the high efficiency of sentence-level
compression. Experiment results on the CNN/DailyMail, DUC-2002, and Pubmed
datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the select-then-compress
framework and other strong baselines.</span>

new data distribution by combining known components. Although humans seem to
have a great ability to generalize compositionally, state-of-the-art neural

in classification tasks and present two main contributions. First, we study
ways to convert a natural language sequence-to-sequence dataset to a

that can be answered by a specific answer for a given context. Previous
sequence-to-sequence models suffer from a problem that asking high-quality
questions requires commonsense knowledge as backgrounds, which in most cases
can not be learned directly from training data, resulting in unsatisfactory
questions deprived of knowledge. In this paper, we propose a multi-task
learning framework to introduce commonsense knowledge into question generation
process. We first retrieve relevant commonsense knowledge triples from mature
databases and select triples with the conversion information from source
context to question. Based on these informative knowledge triples, we design
two auxiliary tasks to incorporate commonsense knowledge into the main QG
model, where one task is Concept Relation Classification and the other is Tail
Concept Generation. Experimental results on SQuAD show that our proposed
methods are able to noticeably improve the QG performance on both automatic and
human evaluation metrics, demonstrating that incorporating external commonsense
knowledge with multi-task learning can help the model generate human-like and
high-quality questions.</span>

undesirable behavior. We propose a Process for Adapting Language Models to
Society (PALMS) with Values-Targeted Datasets, an iterative process to
significantly change model behavior by crafting and fine-tuning on a dataset
that reflects a predetermined set of target values. We evaluate our process
using three metrics: quantitative metrics with human evaluations that score
output adherence to a target value, and toxicity scoring on outputs; and
qualitative metrics analyzing the most common word associated with a given
social category. Through each iteration, we add additional training dataset
examples based on observed shortcomings from evaluations. PALMS performs
significantly better on all metrics compared to baseline and control models for
a broad range of GPT-3 language model sizes without compromising capability
integrity. We find that the effectiveness of PALMS increases with model size.
We show that significantly adjusting language model behavior is feasible with a
small, hand-curated dataset.</span>

paraphrasing the sentence or substituting the keywords without altering the
content. By necessity, state-of-the-art methods have evolved to accommodate
nonparallel training data, as it is frequently the case there are multiple data
sources of unequal size, with a mixture of labeled and unlabeled sentences.
Moreover, the inherent style defined within each source might be distinct. A
generic bidirectional (e.g., formal $\Leftrightarrow$ informal) style transfer
regardless of different groups may not generalize well to different
applications. In this work, we developed a task adaptive meta-learning
framework that can simultaneously perform a multi-pair text-style transfer
using a single model. The proposed method can adaptively balance the difference
of meta-knowledge across multiple tasks. Results show that our method leads to
better quantitative performance as well as coherent style variations. Common
challenges of unbalanced data and mismatched domains are handled well by this

information from different parts of an input sequence, making it a powerful
mechanism for sequence modeling. Multilingual and multi-domain learning are
common scenarios for sequence modeling, where the key challenge is to maximize
positive transfer and mitigate negative transfer across languages and domains.
In this paper, we find that non-selective attention sharing is sub-optimal for
achieving good generalization across all languages and domains. We further
propose attention sharing strategies to facilitate parameter sharing and
specialization in multilingual and multi-domain sequence modeling. Our approach
automatically learns shared and specialized attention heads for different
languages and domains to mitigate their interference. Evaluated in various
tasks including speech recognition, text-to-text and speech-to-text
translation, the proposed attention sharing strategies consistently bring gains
to sequence models built upon multi-head attention. For speech-to-text
translation, our approach yields an average of $+2.0$ BLEU over $13$ language
directions in multilingual setting and $+2.0$ BLEU over $3$ domains in
multi-domain setting.</span>

input text to generate appropriate and relevant response in data-driven
approaches. Although the semantic and syntactic quality of the language
generated is evaluated, more often than not, the encoded representation of
input is not evaluated. As the representation of the encoder is essential for
predicting the appropriate response, evaluation of encoder representation is a
challenging yet important problem. In this work, we showcase evaluating the
text generated through human or automatic metrics is not sufficient to
appropriately evaluate soundness of the language understanding of dialogue
models and, to that end, propose a set of probe tasks to evaluate encoder
representation of different language encoders commonly used in dialogue models.
From experiments, we observe that some of the probe tasks are easier and some
are harder for even sophisticated model architectures to learn. And, through
experiments we observe that RNN based architectures have lower performance on
automatic metrics on text generation than transformer model but perform better
than the transformer model on the probe tasks indicating that RNNs might
preserve task information better than the Transformers.</span>

body text, etc.-is a critical first step in automated scientific document
understanding. Previous work has shown how using elementary layout information,
i.e., each token&#x27;s 2D position on the page, leads to more accurate
classification. We introduce new methods for incorporating VIsual LAyout (VILA)
structures, e.g., the grouping of page texts into text lines or text blocks,
into language models to further improve performance. We show that the I-VILA
approach, which simply adds special tokens denoting the boundaries of layout
structures into model inputs, can lead to 1.9% Macro F1 improvements for token
classification. Moreover, we design a hierarchical model, H-VILA, that encodes
the text based on layout structures and record an up-to 47% inference time
reduction with less than 1.5% Macro F1 loss for the text classification models.
Experiments are conducted on a newly curated evaluation suite, S2-VLUE, with a
novel metric measuring classification uniformity within visual groups and a new
dataset of gold annotations covering papers from 19 scientific disciplines.

                                        <span>Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand
visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., &#x60;yeah&#x27; and &#x60;yes&#x27;). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as &#x60;I don&#x27;t know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG
state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won
the recent Visual Dialog 2020 challenge. Source code is available at

medical specialists in vital circumstances. Deep learning methodologies
constitute a main approach for chest CT scan analysis and disease prediction.
However, large annotated databases are necessary for developing deep learning
models that are able to provide COVID-19 diagnosis across various medical
environments in different countries. Due to privacy issues, publicly available
COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders the research
and development of AI-enabled diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based on CT scans.
In this paper we present the COV19-CT-DB database which is annotated for
COVID-19, consisting of about 5,000 3-D CT scans, We have split the database in
training, validation and test datasets. The former two datasets can be used for
training and validation of machine learning models, while the latter will be
used for evaluation of the developed models. We also present a deep learning
approach, based on a CNN-RNN network and report its performance on the
COVID19-CT-DB database.</span>

                                        <span>Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging problem when
given image category labels but requires to learn object localization models.
Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to
activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,
causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial
activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the
convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty
to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token
semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the
self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency
extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for
spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency
to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related
semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object
categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic
attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the
ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM
counterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</span>

or parts, and the impression of fonts. By focusing on local shapes instead of
the whole letter shape, we can realize letter-shape independent and more
general analysis. The analysis is performed by newly combining SIFT and
DeepSets, to extract an arbitrary number of essential parts from a particular
font and aggregate them to infer the font impressions by nonlinear regression.
Our qualitative and quantitative analyses prove that (1)fonts with similar

                                        <span>Facial action unit (AU) detection in the wild is a challenging problem, due
to the unconstrained variability in facial appearances and the lack of accurate
annotations. Most existing methods depend on either impractical labor-intensive
labeling or inaccurate pseudo labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
unconstrained facial AU detection framework based on domain adaptation, which
transfers accurate AU labels from a constrained source domain to an
unconstrained target domain by exploiting labels of AU-related facial
landmarks. Specifically, we map a source image with label and a target image
without label into a latent feature domain by combining source landmark-related
feature with target landmark-free feature. Due to the combination of source
AU-related information and target AU-free information, the latent feature
domain with transferred source label can be learned by maximizing the
target-domain AU detection performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel landmark
adversarial loss to disentangle the landmark-free feature from the
landmark-related feature by treating the adversarial learning as a multi-player
minimax game. Our framework can also be naturally extended for use with
target-domain pseudo AU labels. Extensive experiments show that our method
soundly outperforms lower-bounds and upper-bounds of the basic model, as well
as state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging in-the-wild benchmarks. The

quality of prototypes plays a key role in the algorithm. In this paper we
propose the trainable prototypes for distance measure instead of the artificial
ones within the meta-training and task-training framework. Also to avoid the
disadvantages that the episodic meta-training brought, we adopt non-episodic
meta-training based on self-supervised learning. Overall we solve the few-shot
tasks in two phases: meta-training a transferable feature extractor via
self-supervised learning and training the prototypes for metric classification.
In addition, the simple attention mechanism is used in both meta-training and
task-training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of
established few-shot tasks on the standard few-shot visual classification
dataset, with about 20% increase compared to the available unsupervised
few-shot learning methods.</span>

classification tasks, and we provide strong computable bounds on the amount of
remaining information after forgetting. Inspired by real-world applications of
forgetting techniques, we introduce a novel notion of forgetting in
mixed-privacy setting, where we know that a &quot;core&quot; subset of the training
samples does not need to be forgotten. While this variation of the problem is
conceptually simple, we show that working in this setting significantly
improves the accuracy and guarantees of forgetting methods applied to vision
classification tasks. Moreover, our method allows efficient removal of all
information contained in non-core data by simply setting to zero a subset of
the weights with minimal loss in performance. We achieve these results by
replacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With
opportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show
that such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original
network and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved
efficiently even for large models. Unlike previous forgetting methods on deep
networks, ours can achieve close to the state-of-the-art accuracy on large
scale vision tasks. In particular, we show that our method allows forgetting
without having to trade off the model accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>The grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a critical prognostic
factor, making ccRCC nuclei grading a crucial task in RCC pathology analysis.
Computer-aided nuclei grading aims to improve pathologists&#x27; work efficiency
while reducing their misdiagnosis rate by automatically identifying the grades
of tumor nuclei within histopathological images. Such a task requires precisely
segment and accurately classify the nuclei. However, most of the existing
nuclei segmentation and classification methods can not handle the inter-class
similarity property of nuclei grading, thus can not be directly applied to the
ccRCC grading task. In this paper, we propose a Composite High-Resolution
Network for ccRCC nuclei grading. Specifically, we propose a segmentation
network called W-Net that can separate the clustered nuclei. Then, we recast
the fine-grained classification of nuclei to two cross-category classification
tasks, based on two high-resolution feature extractors (HRFEs) which are
proposed for learning these two tasks. The two HRFEs share the same backbone
encoder with W-Net by a composite connection so that meaningful features for
the segmentation task can be inherited for the classification task. Last, a
head-fusion block is applied to generate the predicted label of each nucleus.
Furthermore, we introduce a dataset for ccRCC nuclei grading, containing 1000
image patches with 70945 annotated nuclei. We demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on
this large ccRCC grading dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Deep visual models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations to inputs.
Although these signals are carefully crafted, they still appear noise-like
patterns to humans. This observation has led to the argument that deep visual
representation is misaligned with human perception. We counter-argue by
providing evidence of human-meaningful patterns in adversarial perturbations.
We first propose an attack that fools a network to confuse a whole category of
objects (source class) with a target label. Our attack also limits the
unintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing
human-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed
attack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the
perturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision
boundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the
&#x60;adversarial&#x27; objective of our attack to use it as a tool to &#x60;explain&#x27; deep
visual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the
perturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model&#x27;s understanding
of human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability
properties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and
interactive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust
&#x60;classifiers&#x27;.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial
attack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual
models. The article also makes secondary contributions in terms of establishing
the utility of our attack beyond the adversarial objective with multiple
interesting applications.</span>

examples. It&#x27;s critically needed for many practical applications but so far
remains challenging. We propose a meta-learning based few-shot object detection
method by transferring meta-knowledge learned from data-abundant base classes
to data-scarce novel classes. Our method incorporates a coarse-to-fine approach
into the proposal based object detection framework and integrates prototype
based classifiers into both the proposal generation and classification stages.
To improve proposal generation for few-shot novel classes, we propose to learn
a lightweight matching network to measure the similarity between each spatial
position in the query image feature map and spatially-pooled class features,
instead of the traditional object/nonobject classifier, thus generating
category-specific proposals and improving proposal recall for novel classes. To
address the spatial misalignment between generated proposals and few-shot class
examples, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method, thus improving
the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we jointly learn a
Faster R-CNN detection head for base classes. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple FSOD benchmarks show our proposed approach achieves state of the
art results under (incremental) few-shot learning settings.</span>

                                        <span>Image captioning has recently demonstrated impressive progress largely owing
to the introduction of neural network algorithms trained on curated dataset
like MS-COCO. Often work in this field is motivated by the promise of
deployment of captioning systems in practical applications. However, the
scarcity of data and contexts in many competition datasets renders the utility
of systems trained on these datasets limited as an assistive technology in
real-world settings, such as helping visually impaired people navigate and
accomplish everyday tasks. This gap motivated the introduction of the novel
VizWiz dataset, which consists of images taken by the visually impaired and
captions that have useful, task-oriented information. In an attempt to help the
machine learning computer vision field realize its promise of producing
technologies that have positive social impact, the curators of the VizWiz
dataset host several competitions, including one for image captioning. This
work details the theory and engineering from our winning submission to the 2020
captioning competition. Our work provides a step towards improved assistive
image captioning systems.</span>

Smilkov et al., 2017] that provide instance-specific explanations of model
predictions are often based on assumption (A): magnitude of input gradients --
gradients of logits with respect to input -- noisily highlight discriminative
task-relevant features. In this work, we test the validity of assumption (A)
using a three-pronged approach. First, we develop an evaluation framework,
DiffROAR, to test assumption (A) on four image classification benchmarks. Our
results suggest that (i) input gradients of standard models (i.e., trained on
original data) may grossly violate (A), whereas (ii) input gradients of
adversarially robust models satisfy (A). Second, we then introduce BlockMNIST,
an MNIST-based semi-real dataset, that by design encodes a priori knowledge of
discriminative features. Our analysis on BlockMNIST leverages this information
to validate as well as characterize differences between input gradient
attributions of standard and robust models. Finally, we theoretically prove
that our empirical findings hold on a simplified version of the BlockMNIST
dataset. Specifically, we prove that input gradients of standard
one-hidden-layer MLPs trained on this dataset do not highlight
instance-specific signal coordinates, thus grossly violating assumption (A).
Our findings motivate the need to formalize and test common assumptions in
interpretability in a falsifiable manner [Leavitt and Morcos, 2020].
Additionally, we believe that the DiffROAR evaluation framework and
BlockMNIST-based datasets can serve as sanity checks to audit instance-specific
interpretability methods.</span>

                                        <span>The usage of environment sensor models for virtual testing is a promising
approach to reduce the testing effort of autonomous driving. However, in order
to deduce any statements regarding the performance of an autonomous driving
function based on simulation, the sensor model has to be validated to determine
the discrepancy between the synthetic and real sensor data. Since a certain
degree of divergence can be assumed to exist, the sufficient level of fidelity
must be determined, which poses a major challenge. In particular, a method for
quantifying the fidelity of a sensor model does not exist and the problem of
defining an appropriate metric remains. In this work, we train a neural network
to distinguish real and simulated radar sensor data with the purpose of
learning the latent features of real radar point clouds. Furthermore, we
propose the classifier&#x27;s confidence score for the &#x60;real radar point cloud&#x27;
class as a metric to determine the degree of fidelity of synthetically
generated radar data. The presented approach is evaluated and it can be
demonstrated that the proposed deep evaluation metric outperforms conventional

                                        <span>In this paper, we address Novel Class Discovery (NCD), the task of unveiling
new classes in a set of unlabeled samples given a labeled dataset with known
classes. We exploit the peculiarities of NCD to build a new framework, named
Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL), to learn discriminative
representations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution
is twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set
generates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are
likely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and
aggregate pseudo-positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the
model to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most
of the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to
the contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate hard
negatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We
experimentally demonstrate that these two ingredients significantly contribute
to clustering performance and lead our model to outperform state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin (e.g., clustering accuracy +13% on CIFAR-100 and +8%
on ImageNet).</span>

                                        <span>Recently spiking neural networks (SNNs), the third-generation of neural
networks has shown remarkable capabilities of energy-efficient computing, which
is a promising alternative for deep neural networks (DNNs) with high energy
consumption. SNNs have reached competitive results compared to DNNs in
relatively simple tasks and small datasets such as image classification and
MNIST/CIFAR, while few studies on more challenging vision tasks on complex
datasets. In this paper, we focus on extending deep SNNs to object tracking, a
more advanced vision task with embedded applications and energy-saving
requirements, and present a spike-based Siamese network called SiamSNN.
Specifically, we propose an optimized hybrid similarity estimation method to
exploit temporal information in the SNNs, and introduce a novel two-status
coding scheme to optimize the temporal distribution of output spike trains for
further improvements. SiamSNN is the first deep SNN tracker that achieves short
latency and low precision loss on the visual object tracking benchmarks
OTB2013/2015, VOT2016/2018, and GOT-10k. Moreover, SiamSNN achieves notably low
energy consumption and real-time on Neuromorphic chip TrueNorth.</span>

frames as an input, and are still far from real-time processing rates. In this
work, we present the Isometry-Aware Monocular Generative Adversarial Network
(IsMo-GAN) - an approach for direct 3D reconstruction from a single image,
trained for the deformation model in an adversarial manner on a light-weight
synthetic dataset. IsMo-GAN reconstructs surfaces from real images under
varying illumination, camera poses, textures and shading at over 250 Hz. In
multiple experiments, it consistently outperforms several approaches in the
reconstruction accuracy, runtime, generalisation to unknown surfaces and
robustness to occlusions. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, we reduce the
reconstruction error by 10-30% including the textureless case and our surfaces
evince fewer artefacts qualitatively.</span>

                                        <span>In the era of big data, methods for improving memory and computational
efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies.
Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational
limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this
problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary
codes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes
intractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have
been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and
still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods
is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high
quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary
variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the
computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is
unnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral
hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead
of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to
the data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the
binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and
computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization
techniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain
the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show
that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly
competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low
complexity.</span>

properties of directionally sensitive analyzing functions in multiscale systems

detectors are inspired by the notion of phase congruency, stable in the
presence of noise, and by definition invariant to changes in contrast. We also
show how the behavior of coefficients corresponding to differently scaled and

characterization of the geometry of features in terms of local tangent
directions, widths, and heights. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
measures are validated and compared to various state-of-the-art algorithms in
extensive numerical experiments in which we consider sets of clean and
distorted synthetic images that are associated with reliable ground truths. To
further demonstrate the applicability, we show how the proposed ridge measure

(AVVP) task that demarcates events from a video separately for audio and visual
modalities. The proposed parsing approach simultaneously detects the temporal
boundaries in terms of start and end times of such events. We show how AVVP can
benefit from the following techniques geared towards effective cross-modal
learning: (i) adversarial training and skip connections (ii) global context
aware attention and, (iii) self-supervised pretraining using an audio-video
grounding objective to obtain cross-modal audio-video representations. We
present extensive experimental evaluations on the Look, Listen, and Parse (LLP)
dataset and show that we outperform the state-of-the-art Hybrid Attention
Network (HAN) on all five metrics proposed for AVVP. We also present several
ablations to validate the effect of pretraining, global attention and
adversarial training.</span>

Localization Challenge 2021, Weakly-Supervised Learning Track. The goal of
weakly-supervised temporal action localization is to temporally locate and
classify action of interest in untrimmed videos given only video-level labels.
We adopt the two-stream consensus network (TSCN) as the main framework in this
challenge. The TSCN consists of a two-stream base model training procedure and
a pseudo ground truth learning procedure. The base model training encourages
the model to predict reliable predictions based on single modality (i.e., RGB
or optical flow), based on the fusion of which a pseudo ground truth is
generated and in turn used as supervision to train the base models. On the HACS
v1.1.1 dataset, without fine-tuning the feature-extraction I3D models, our
method achieves 22.20% on the validation set and 21.68% on the testing set in
terms of average mAP. Our solution ranked the 2rd in this challenge, and we
hope our method can serve as a baseline for future academic research.</span>

uses a neural network for estimating the coding probabilities for the occupancy
status of voxels, depending on wide three dimensional contexts around the voxel
to be encoded. The point cloud is represented as an octree, with each
resolution layer being sequentially encoded and decoded using arithmetic
coding, starting from the lowest resolution, until the final resolution is
reached. The occupancy probability of each voxel of the splitting pattern at
each node of the octree is modeled by a neural network, having at its input the
already encoded occupancy status of several octree nodes (belonging to the past
and current resolutions), corresponding to a 3D context surrounding the node to
be encoded. The algorithm has a fast and a slow version, the fast version
selecting differently several voxels of the context, which allows an increased
parallelization by sending larger batches of templates to be estimated by the
neural network, at both encoder and decoder. The proposed algorithms yield
state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. The implementation will be made

endangered the power of digital images.An image was supposed to be worth more
than a thousand words,but now this can be said only if it can be authenticated
orthe integrity of the image can be proved to be intact. In thispaper, we
propose a digital image forensic technique for JPEG images. It can detect any
forgery in the image if the forged portion called a ghost image is having a
compression quality different from that of the cover image. It is based on
resaving the JPEG image at different JPEG qualities, and the detection of the
forged portion is maximum when it is saved at the same JPEG quality as the
cover image. Also, we can precisely predictthe JPEG quality of the cover image
by analyzing the similarity using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) or
the energyof the images. The first maxima in SSIM or the first minima inenergy
correspond to the cover image JPEG quality. We created adataset for varying
JPEG compression qualities of the ghost and the cover images and validated the
scalability of the experimental results.We also, experimented with varied
attack scenarios, e.g. high-quality ghost image embedded in low quality of
cover image,low-quality ghost image embedded in high-quality of cover image,and
ghost image and cover image both at the same quality.The proposed method is
able to localize the tampered portions accurately even for forgeries as small
as 10x10 sized pixel blocks.Our technique is also robust against other attack
scenarios like copy-move forgery, inserting text into image, rescaling
(zoom-out/zoom-in) ghost image and then pasting on cover image.</span>

                                        <span>Most consumer-grade digital cameras can only capture a limited range of
luminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and
quantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to
obtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most
common solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures.
However, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene
and most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In
this work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic
encoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single
image HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network
consists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical
multi-scale information, a condition network to perform pattern-specific
modulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information.
Moreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of
over-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method
achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and
visual quality. The proposed HDRUNet model won the second place in the single
frame track of NITRE2021 High Dynamic Range Challenge.</span>

                                        <span>Stereotactic body radiation therapy allows for a precise and accurate dose
delivery. Organ motion during treatment bears the risk of undetected high dose
healthy tissue exposure. An organ very susceptible to high dose is the
oesophagus. Its low contrast on CT and the oblong shape renders motion
estimation difficult. We tackle this issue by modern algorithms to measure the
oesophageal motion voxel-wise and to estimate motion related dosimetric impact.
Oesophageal motion was measured using deformable image registration and 4DCT of
11 internal and 5 public datasets. Current clinical practice of contouring the
organ on 3DCT was compared to timely resolved 4DCT contours. The dosimetric
impact of the motion was estimated by analysing the trajectory of each voxel in
the 4D dose distribution. Finally an organ motion model was built, allowing for
easier patient-wise comparisons. Motion analysis showed mean absolute maximal
motion amplitudes of 4.55 +/- 1.81 mm left-right, 5.29 +/- 2.67 mm
anterior-posterior and 10.78 +/- 5.30 mm superior-inferior. Motion between the
cohorts differed significantly. In around 50 % of the cases the dosimetric
passing criteria was violated. Contours created on 3DCT did not cover 14 % of
the organ for 50 % of the respiratory cycle and the 3D contour is around 38 %
smaller than the union of all 4D contours. The motion model revealed that the
maximal motion is not limited to the lower part of the organ. Our results
showed motion amplitudes higher than most reported values in the literature and
that motion is very heterogeneous across patients. Therefore, individual motion
information should be considered in contouring and planning.</span>

agriculture, recently. The common goal of all computer vision-based precision
agriculture tasks is to detect the objects of interest (e.g., crop, weed) and
discriminating them from the background. The Weeds are unwanted plants growing
among crops competing for nutrients, water, and sunlight, causing losses to
crop yields. Weed detection and mapping is critical for site-specific weed
management to reduce the cost of labor and impact of herbicides. This paper
investigates the use of color and texture features for discrimination of
Soybean crops and weeds. Feature extraction methods including two color spaces
(RGB, HSV), gray level Co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and Local Binary Pattern

                                        <span>Neural shape representations have recently shown to be effective in shape
analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing neural network methods require
point coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level
sets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data,
therefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing
stages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a
divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require
normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the
divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably
orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even
better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly.
Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for
sinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to
the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task
of surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to
other unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.</span>

continuously updating the model is important. Although updating a model with
real incoming data is ideal, using all of them is not always feasible due to
limits, such as labeling and communication costs. Thus, it is necessary to
filter and select the data to use for training (i.e., active learning) on the
device. In this paper, we formalize a practical active learning problem for
DNNs on edge devices and propose a general task-agnostic framework to tackle
this problem, which reduces it to a stream submodular maximization. This
framework is light enough to be run with low computational resources, yet
provides solutions whose quality is theoretically guaranteed thanks to the
submodular property. Through this framework, we can configure data selection
criteria flexibly, including using methods proposed in previous active learning

tasks in a practical setting to simulate a real-life scenario. The results of

both tasks, while running at a practical speed on real devices.</span>

                                        <span>As a 3D counterpart of object classification in images, object point cloud
classification is fundamental to 3D scene understanding, and has drawn great
research attention since the release of benchmarking datasets, such as the
ModelNet and the ShapeNet. These benchmarks assume point clouds covering
complete surfaces of object instances, for which plenty of high-performing
methods have been developed. However, their settings deviate from those often
met in practice, where, due to (self-)occlusion, a point cloud covering partial
surface of an object is captured from an arbitrary view. We show in this paper
that performance of existing point cloud classification methods drops
drastically under the considered practical single-view, partial setting; the
phenomenon is consistent with the observation that semantic category of a
partial object surface is less ambiguous only when its distribution on the
whole surface is clearly specified. To this end, we argue for a single-view,
partial setting where supervised learning of object pose estimation should be
accompanied with classification. Technically, we propose a baseline method of
Pose-Accompanied Point cloud classification Network (PAPNet); built upon
SE(3)-equivariant convolutions, the PAPNet learns intermediate pose
transformations for equivariant features defined on vector fields, which makes
the subsequent classification easier (ideally) in the category-level, canonical
pose. We adapt existing ModelNet40 and ScanNet datasets on point set
classification to the introduced single-view, partial setting to verify our
hypothesis. Thorough experiments confirm the necessity of object pose
estimation; our PAPNet also outperforms existing methods greatly on the new
benchmarks.</span>

First, a temporal context-aware Bi-LSTM Aggregation Module is developed to
aggregate clip-level representations, replacing the original max-pooling.
Second, we propose to employ Random Concatenation Augmentation (RCA) mechanism
during the training phase. In the second stage, we use pretrained MDETR model

hand-crafted rules to select the best matching bounding box outputted by MDETR

                                        <span>A new learning paradigm, self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve
such problems by pre-training a general model with large unlabeled images and
then fine-tuning on a downstream task with very few labeled samples.
Contrastive learning is a typical method of SSL, which can learn general
invariant features. However, most of the existing contrastive learning is
designed for classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation,
which may be sub-optimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level
discrimination. Therefore, we propose Global style and Local matching
Contrastive Learning Network (GLCNet) for remote sensing semantic segmentation.
Specifically, the global style contrastive module is used to learn an
image-level representation better, as we consider the style features can better
represent the overall image features; The local features matching contrastive
module is designed to learn representations of local regions which is
beneficial for semantic segmentation. We evaluate four remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets, and the experimental results show that our method mostly
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and ImageNet pre-training.
Specifically, with 1\% annotation from the original dataset, our approach
improves Kappa by 6\% on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset and 3\% on Deep Globe Land
Cover Classification dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our
method outperforms supervised learning when there are some differences between
the datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks. Our study promotes the
development of self-supervised learning in the field of remote sensing semantic
segmentation. The source code is available at

                                        <span>Underwater image restoration is of significant importance in unveiling the
underwater world. Numerous techniques and algorithms have been developed in the
past decades. However, due to fundamental difficulties associated with
imaging/sensing, lighting, and refractive geometric distortions, in capturing
clear underwater images, no comprehensive evaluations have been conducted of
underwater image restoration. To address this gap, we have constructed a
large-scale real underwater image dataset, dubbed &#x60;HICRD&#x27; (Heron Island Coral
Reef Dataset), for the purpose of benchmarking existing methods and supporting
the development of new deep-learning based methods. We employ accurate water
parameter (diffuse attenuation coefficient) in generating reference images.
There are 2000 reference restored images and 6003 original underwater images in
the unpaired training set. Further, we present a novel method for underwater
image restoration based on unsupervised image-to-image translation framework.
Our proposed method leveraged contrastive learning and generative adversarial
networks to maximize the mutual information between raw and restored images.
Extensive experiments with comparisons to recent approaches further demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method. Our code and dataset are publicly
available at GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Low-power computer vision on embedded devices has many applications. This
paper describes a low-power technique for the object re-identification (reID)
problem: matching a query image against a gallery of previously seen images.
State-of-the-art techniques rely on large, computationally-intensive Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose a novel hierarchical DNN architecture that
uses attribute labels in the training dataset to perform efficient object reID.
At each node in the hierarchy, a small DNN identifies a different attribute of
the query image. The small DNN at each leaf node is specialized to re-identify
a subset of the gallery: only the images with the attributes identified along
the path from the root to a leaf. Thus, a query image is re-identified
accurately after processing with a few small DNNs. We compare our method with
state-of-the-art object reID techniques. With a 4% loss in accuracy, our
approach realizes significant resource savings: 74% less memory, 72% fewer
operations, and 67% lower query latency, yielding 65% less energy consumption.</span>

pretrained GAN model, for the image to be faithfully reconstructed from the
inverted code by the generator. As an emerging technique to bridge the real and
fake image domains, GAN inversion plays an essential role in enabling the
pretrained GAN models such as StyleGAN and BigGAN to be used for real image
editing applications. Meanwhile, GAN inversion also provides insights on the
interpretation of GAN&#x27;s latent space and how the realistic images can be
generated. In this paper, we provide an overview of GAN inversion with a focus
on its recent algorithms and applications. We cover important techniques of GAN
inversion and their applications to image restoration and image manipulation.

                                        <span>Occlusion is one of the most significant challenges encountered by object
detectors and trackers. While both object detection and tracking has received a
lot of attention in the past, most existing methods in this domain do not
target detecting or tracking objects when they are occluded. However, being
able to detect or track an object of interest through occlusion has been a long
standing challenge for different autonomous tasks. Traditional methods that
employ visual object trackers with explicit occlusion modeling experience drift
and make several fundamental assumptions about the data. We propose to address
this with a &#x60;tracking-by-detection&#x60; approach that builds upon the success of
region based video object detectors. Our video level object detector uses a
novel recurrent computational unit at its core that enables long term
propagation of object features even under occlusion. Finally, we compare our
approach with existing state-of-the-art video object detectors and show that
our approach achieves superior results on a dataset of furniture assembly
videos collected from the internet, where small objects like screws, nuts, and
bolts often get occluded from the camera viewpoint.</span>

                                        <span>This paper reviews the current state of the art in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A
brief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is
provided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to
how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,
iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information
extraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the
successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these
areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and
its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near
future, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or
collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the
successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is
the &#x60;creator&#x27;, remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win
awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also
limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the
context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where
its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than
replace, human creativity.</span>

vulnerable to small perturbations that are crafted to generate Adversarial
Examples(AEs). The AEs are imperceptible to humans and cause DNN to misclassify
them. Many defense and detection techniques have been proposed. Model&#x27;s
confidences and Dropout, as a popular way to estimate the model&#x27;s uncertainty,
have been used for AE detection but they showed limited success against black-
and gray-box attacks. Moreover, the state-of-the-art detection techniques have
been designed for specific attacks or broken by others, need knowledge about
the attacks, are not consistent, increase model parameters overhead, are
time-consuming, or have latency in inference time. To trade off these factors,
we revisit the model&#x27;s uncertainty and confidences and propose a novel
unsupervised ensemble AE detection mechanism that 1) uses the uncertainty
method called SelectiveNet, 2) processes model layers outputs, i.e.feature
maps, to generate new confidence probabilities. The detection method is called
Selective and Feature based Adversarial Detection (SFAD). Experimental results
show that the proposed approach achieves better performance against black- and
gray-box attacks than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable
performance against white-box attacks. Moreover, results show that SFAD is
fully robust against High Confidence Attacks (HCAs) for MNIST and partially
robust for CIFAR10 datasets.</span>

Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge. The generative learning task can be formulated as
interpolating between a reference distribution and a target distribution based
on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. At the population level, this entropy
interpolation is characterized via an SDE on $[0,1]$ with a time-varying drift
term. At the sample level, we derive our Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge algorithm by
plugging the drift term estimated by a deep score estimator and a deep density
ratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method. Under some mild smoothness
assumptions of the target distribution, we prove the consistency of both the
score estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then establish the
consistency of the proposed Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical
results guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to
the target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and
benchmark data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the
generative model via Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art
GANs, suggesting a new formulation of generative learning. We demonstrate its
usefulness in image interpolation and image inpainting.</span>

automatically search architecture for deepfake detection. Unlike previous
works, our method benefits from the superior capability of deep learning while
relieving us from the high labor cost in the manual network design process. It
is experimentally proved that our proposed method not only outperforms previous
non-deep learning methods but achieves comparable or even better prediction
accuracy compared to previous deep learning methods. To improve the generality
of our method, especially when training data and testing data are manipulated
by different methods, we propose a multi-task strategy in our network learning
process, making it estimate potential manipulation regions in given samples as
well as predict whether the samples are real. Comparing to previous works using
similar strategies, our method depends much less on prior knowledge, such as no
need to know which manipulation method is utilized and whether it is utilized
already. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method on deepfake detection.</span>

under constrained resource settings like few-shot learning. The popular
approaches for ML either learn a generalizable initial model or a generic
parametric optimizer through episodic training. The former approaches leverage
the knowledge from a batch of tasks to learn an optimal prior. In this work, we
study the importance of a batch for ML. Specifically, we first incorporate a
batch episodic training regimen to improve the learning of the generic
parametric optimizer. We also hypothesize that the common assumption in batch
episodic training that each task in a batch has an equal contribution to
learning an optimal meta-model need not be true. We propose to weight the tasks
in a batch according to their &quot;importance&quot; in improving the meta-model&#x27;s
learning. To this end, we introduce a training curriculum motivated by
selective focus in humans, called task attended meta-training, to weight the
tasks in a batch. Task attention is a standalone module that can be integrated
with any batch episodic training regimen. The comparisons of the models with
their non-task-attended counterparts on complex datasets like miniImageNet and
tieredImageNet validate its effectiveness.</span>

fine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class
variances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by
locating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the
complete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its
strong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image
classification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without
requiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention
mechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the
model&#x27;s capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting
with four popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars,
Stanford Dogs, and FGVC7 Plant Pathology. We also prove our model&#x27;s

extract and compare the structure of datasets. TDA identifies features in data
such as connected components and holes and assigns a quantitative measure to
these features. Several studies reported that topological features extracted by
TDA tools provide unique information about the data, discover new insights, and
determine which feature is more related to the outcome. On the other hand, the
overwhelming success of deep neural networks in learning patterns and

\textit{TDA-Net}, a novel ensemble network that fuses topological and deep

                                        <span>Recently, some approaches are proposed to harness deep convolutional networks
to facilitate superpixel segmentation. The common practice is to first evenly
divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate
each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of
convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly
perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.
Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when
inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel
\textbf{A}ssociation \textbf{I}mplantation (AI) module to enable the network to
explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.
The proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the
surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the
padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an
implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid
level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation
comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary
precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network
discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could
benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary
pixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our
method could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain
satisfactory inference efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, image captioning has aroused great interest in both academic and
industrial worlds. Most existing systems are built upon large-scale datasets
consisting of image-sentence pairs, which, however, are time-consuming to
construct. In addition, even for the most advanced image captioning systems, it
is still difficult to realize deep image understanding. In this work, we
achieve unpaired image captioning by bridging the vision and the language
domains with high-level semantic information. The motivation stems from the
fact that the semantic concepts with the same modality can be extracted from
both images and descriptions. To further improve the quality of captions
generated by the model, we propose the Semantic Relationship Explorer, which
explores the relationships between semantic concepts for better understanding
of the image. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO dataset show that we can generate
desirable captions without paired datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach
boosts five strong baselines under the paired setting, where the most
significant improvement in CIDEr score reaches 8%, demonstrating that it is
effective and generalizes well to a wide range of models.</span>

object recognition. However, the most powerful object recognition methods today
do not explicitly make use of object shape during learning. In this work,
motivated by recent developments in low-shot learning, findings in
developmental psychology, and the increased use of synthetic data in computer
vision research, we investigate how reasoning about 3D shape can be used to
improve low-shot learning methods&#x27; generalization performance. We propose a new
way to improve existing low-shot learning approaches by learning a
discriminative embedding space using 3D object shape, and using this embedding
by learning how to map images into it. Our new approach improves the
performance of image-only low-shot learning approaches on multiple datasets. We
also introduce Toys4K, a 3D object dataset with the largest number of object
categories currently available, which supports low-shot learning.</span>

various computer vision tasks but rely on tremendous computational cost. To
solve this problem, existing approaches either compress well-trained
large-scale models or learn lightweight models with carefully designed network
structures. In this work, we make a close study of the convolution operator,
which is the basic unit used in CNNs, to reduce its computing load. In
particular, we propose a compact convolution module, called CompConv, to
facilitate efficient feature learning. With the divide-and-conquer strategy,
CompConv is able to save a great many computations as well as parameters to
produce a certain dimensional feature map. Furthermore, CompConv discreetly
integrates the input features into the outputs to efficiently inherit the input
information. More importantly, the novel CompConv is a plug-and-play module
that can be directly applied to modern CNN structures to replace the vanilla
convolution layers without further effort. Extensive experimental results
suggest that CompConv can adequately compress the benchmark CNN structures yet
barely sacrifice the performance, surpassing other competitors.</span>

                                        <span>Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are becoming more capable of navigating in complex
environments with dynamic and changing conditions. A key component that enables
these intelligent vehicles to overcome such conditions and become more
autonomous is the sophistication of the perception and localization systems. As
part of the localization system, place recognition has benefited from recent
developments in other perception tasks such as place categorization or object
recognition, namely with the emergence of deep learning (DL) frameworks. This
paper surveys recent approaches and methods used in place recognition,
particularly those based on deep learning. The contributions of this work are
twofold: surveying recent sensors such as 3D LiDARs and RADARs, applied in
place recognition; and categorizing the various DL-based place recognition
works into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, parallel, and
hierarchical categories. First, this survey introduces key place recognition
concepts to contextualize the reader. Then, sensor characteristics are
addressed. This survey proceeds by elaborating on the various DL-based works,
presenting summaries for each framework. Some lessons learned from this survey
include: the importance of NetVLAD for supervised end-to-end learning; the
advantages of unsupervised approaches in place recognition, namely for
cross-domain applications; or the increasing tendency of recent works to seek,
not only for higher performance but also for higher efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to
predict how good the performance is when transfer a source model (source task)
to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been widely
used for source model selection and multi-task learning. Earlier metrics does
not work sufficiently well under the challenging cross-domain cross-task
transfer settings, but recent OTCE score achieves a noteworthy performance
using auxiliary tasks. A simplified version named OT-based NCE score sacrifices
accuracy to be more efficient, but it can be further improved. Consequently, we
propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score to further
improve the cross-domain cross-task transferability estimation performance,
which is more efficient than the OTCE score and more accurate than the OT-based
NCE score. Specifically, we build the joint correspondences between source and
target data via solving an optimal transport problem with considering both the
sample distance and label distance, and then compute the transferability score
as the negative conditional entropy. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the OT-based NCE score with about 7% and 12% gains,
respectively.</span>

vision tasks recently, but the huge number of parameters and the high
computation overhead hinder their deployments on resource-constrained edge
devices. It is worth noting that channel pruning is an effective approach for
compressing DNN models. A critical challenge is to determine which channels are
to be removed, so that the model accuracy will not be negatively affected. In
this paper, we first propose Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA), a new
attention module combining both spatial and channel attention that respectively
focuses on &quot;where&quot; and &quot;what&quot; are the most informative parts. Guided by the
scale values generated by SCA for measuring channel importance, we further
propose a new channel pruning approach called Channel Pruning guided by Spatial
and Channel Attention (CPSCA). Experimental results indicate that SCA achieves
the best inference accuracy, while incurring negligibly extra resource
consumption, compared to other state-of-the-art attention modules. Our
evaluation on two benchmark datasets shows that, with the guidance of SCA, our
CPSCA approach achieves higher inference accuracy than other state-of-the-art
pruning methods under the same pruning ratios.</span>

social interactions with other agents. In this article, we present an
asymmetrical bidirectional recurrent neural network architecture called U-RNN
to encode pedestrian trajectories and evaluate its relevance to replace LSTMs
for various forecasting models. Experimental results on the Trajnet++ benchmark
show that the U-LSTM variant yields better results regarding every available
metrics (ADE, FDE, Collision rate) than common trajectory encoders for a

data into a set of few spatial basis of switching temporal processes in a
low-dimensional latent framework. We parameterize these temporal processes with
regard to a switching deep vector autoregressive prior in order to accommodate
both multimodal and higher-order nonlinear inter-dependencies. This results in
a dynamical deep generative latent model that parses the meaningful intrinsic
states in the dynamics of 3D pose data using approximate variational inference,
and enables a realistic low-level dynamical generation and segmentation of
complex skeleton movements. Our experiments on four biological motion data

                                        <span>Deep neural networks that yield human interpretable decisions by
architectural design have lately become an increasingly popular alternative to
post hoc interpretation of traditional black-box models. Among these networks,
the arguably most widespread approach is so-called prototype learning, where
similarities to learned latent prototypes serve as the basis of classifying an
unseen data point. In this work, we point to an important shortcoming of such
approaches. Namely, there is a semantic gap between similarity in latent space
and similarity in input space, which can corrupt interpretability. We design
two experiments that exemplify this issue on the so-called ProtoPNet.
Specifically, we find that this network&#x27;s interpretability mechanism can be led
astray by intentionally crafted or even JPEG compression artefacts, which can
produce incomprehensible decisions. We argue that practitioners ought to have
this shortcoming in mind when deploying prototype-based models in practice.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot dataset generalization is a challenging variant of the well-studied
few-shot classification problem where a diverse training set of several
datasets is given, for the purpose of training an adaptable model that can then
learn classes from new datasets using only a few examples. To this end, we
propose to utilize the diverse training set to construct a universal template:
a partial model that can define a wide array of dataset-specialized models, by
plugging in appropriate components. For each new few-shot classification
problem, our approach therefore only requires inferring a small number of
parameters to insert into the universal template. We design a separate network
that produces an initialization of those parameters for each given task, and we
then fine-tune its proposed initialization via a few steps of gradient descent.
Our approach is more parameter-efficient, scalable and adaptable compared to
previous methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art on the challenging
Meta-Dataset benchmark.</span>

to segment the main body and then provide corrections on mislabeled regions to
iteratively refine the segmentation masks. Most existing methods transform
these user-provided clicks into interaction maps and concatenate them with
image as the input tensor. Typically, the interaction maps are determined by
measuring the distance of each pixel to the clicked points, ignoring the
relation between clicks and mislabeled regions. We propose a Dynamic Click
Transform Network~(DCT-Net), consisting of Spatial-DCT and Feature-DCT, to
better represent user interactions. Spatial-DCT transforms each user-provided
click with individual diffusion distance according to the target scale, and
Feature-DCT normalizes the extracted feature map to a specific distribution

                                        <span>Although hierarchical structures are popular in recent vision transformers,
they require sophisticated designs and massive datasets to work well. In this
work, we explore the idea of nesting basic local transformers on
non-overlapping image blocks and aggregating them in a hierarchical manner. We
find that the block aggregation function plays a critical role in enabling
cross-block non-local information communication. This observation leads us to
design a simplified architecture with minor code changes upon the original
vision transformer and obtains improved performance compared to existing
methods. Our empirical results show that the proposed method NesT converges
faster and requires much less training data to achieve good generalization. For
example, a NesT with 68M parameters trained on ImageNet for 100/300 epochs
achieves $82.3\%/83.8\%$ accuracy evaluated on $224\times 224$ image size,
outperforming previous methods with up to $57\%$ parameter reduction. Training
a NesT with 6M parameters from scratch on CIFAR10 achieves $96\%$ accuracy
using a single GPU, setting a new state of the art for vision transformers.
Beyond image classification, we extend the key idea to image generation and
show NesT leads to a strong decoder that is 8$\times$ faster than previous
transformer based generators. Furthermore, we also propose a novel method for
visually interpreting the learned model. Source code is available

visual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between
software applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical
glitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main
component of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game
development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently
occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of
graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing
techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test
sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These
techniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such
as bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in
automating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich
applications. Specifically, we propose \texttt{GLIB} based on a code-based data
augmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of
\texttt{GLIB} on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the
result shows that \texttt{GLIB} can achieve 100\% precision and 99.5\% recall
in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application
of \texttt{GLIB} on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further
demonstrates that \texttt{GLIB} can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48
of 53 bugs reported by \texttt{GLIB} having been confirmed and fixed so far.</span>

                                        <span>Video Question Answering is a task which requires an AI agent to answer
questions grounded in video. This task entails three key challenges: (1)
understand the intention of various questions, (2) capturing various elements
of the input video (e.g., object, action, causality), and (3) cross-modal
grounding between language and vision information. We propose Motion-Appearance
Synergistic Networks (MASN), which embed two cross-modal features grounded on
motion and appearance information and selectively utilize them depending on the
question&#x27;s intentions. MASN consists of a motion module, an appearance module,
and a motion-appearance fusion module. The motion module computes the
action-oriented cross-modal joint representations, while the appearance module
focuses on the appearance aspect of the input video. Finally, the
motion-appearance fusion module takes each output of the motion module and the
appearance module as input, and performs question-guided fusion. As a result,
MASN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the TGIF-QA and MSVD-QA
datasets. We also conduct qualitative analysis by visualizing the inference
results of MASN. The code is available at

                                        <span>Direct reconstruction methods have been developed to estimate parametric
images directly from the measured PET sinograms by combining the PET imaging
model and tracer kinetics in an integrated framework. Due to limited counts
received, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images
produced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently
supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical
imaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training
labels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can
be acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for
dynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this
work, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric
reconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the
relative equilibrium Logan model. The patient&#x27;s anatomical prior image, which
is readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network
input to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel
layer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was
embedded in the network structure as a 1x1 convolution layer. The training
objective function was based on the PET statistical model. Evaluations based on
dynamic datasets of 18F-FDG and 11C-PiB tracers show that the proposed
framework can outperform the traditional and the kernel method-based direct
reconstruction methods.</span>

                                        <span>Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens women&#x27;s health,
and is one of the most common that affects women worldwide. For its early
detection, colposcopic images of the cervix are used for searching for possible
injuries or abnormalities. An inherent characteristic of these images is the
presence of specular reflections (brightness) that make it difficult to observe
some regions, which might imply misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new strategy
based on neural networks is introduced for eliminating specular reflections and
estimating the unobserved anatomical cervix portion under the bright zones. For
overcoming the fact that the ground truth corresponding to the specular
reflection regions is always unknown, the new strategy proposes the supervised
training of a neural network to learn how to restore any hidden regions of
colposcopic images. Once the specular reflections are identified, they are
removed from the image, and the previously trained network is used to fulfill
these deleted areas. The quality of the processed images was evaluated
quantitatively and qualitatively. In 21 of the 22 evaluated images, the
detected specular reflections were eliminated, whereas, in the remaining one,
these reflections were almost completely eliminated. The distribution of the
colors and the content of the restored images are similar to those of the
originals. The evaluation carried out by a specialist in Cervix Pathology
concluded that, after eliminating the specular reflections, the anatomical and
physiological elements of the cervix are observable in the restored images,
which facilitates the medical diagnosis of cervical pathologies. Our method has
the potential to improve the early detection of cervical cancer.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose an efficient saliency map generation method, called
Group score-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Group-CAM), which adopts the
&quot;split-transform-merge&quot; strategy to generate saliency maps. Specifically, for
an input image, the class activations are firstly split into groups. In each
group, the sub-activations are summed and de-noised as an initial mask. After
that, the initial masks are transformed with meaningful perturbations and then
applied to preserve sub-pixels of the input (i.e., masked inputs), which are
then fed into the network to calculate the confidence scores. Finally, the
initial masks are weighted summed to form the final saliency map, where the
weights are confidence scores produced by the masked inputs. Group-CAM is
efficient yet effective, which only requires dozens of queries to the network
while producing target-related saliency maps. As a result, Group-CAM can be
served as an effective data augment trick for fine-tuning the networks. We
comprehensively evaluate the performance of Group-CAM on common-used
benchmarks, including deletion and insertion tests on ImageNet-1k, and pointing
game tests on COCO2017. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
Group-CAM achieves better visual performance than the current state-of-the-art
explanation approaches. The code is available at

                                        <span>Deep time series metric learning is challenging due to the difficult
trade-off between temporal invariance to nonlinear distortion and
discriminative power in identifying non-matching sequences. This paper proposes
a novel neural network-based approach for robust yet discriminative time series
classification and verification. This approach adapts a parameterized attention
model to time warping for greater and more adaptive temporal invariance. It is
robust against not only local but also large global distortions, so that even
matching pairs that do not satisfy the monotonicity, continuity, and boundary
conditions can still be successfully identified. Learning of this model is
further guided by dynamic time warping to impose temporal constraints for
stabilized training and higher discriminative power. It can learn to augment
the inter-class variation through warping, so that similar but different
classes can be effectively distinguished. We experimentally demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed approach over previous non-parametric and deep
models by combining it with a deep online signature verification framework,
after confirming its promising behavior in single-letter handwriting
classification on the Unipen dataset.</span>

analysis of pathology, focusing on infection and ischaemia. We describe the
data preparation of DFUC2021 for ground truth annotation, data curation and
data analysis. The final release of DFUC2021 consists of 15,683 DFU patches,
with 5,955 training, 5,734 for testing and 3,994 unlabeled DFU patches. The
ground truth labels are four classes, i.e. control, infection, ischaemia and
both conditions. We curate the dataset using image hashing techniques and
analyse the separability using UMAP projection. We benchmark the performance of
five key backbones of deep learning, i.e. VGG16, ResNet101, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121 and EfficientNet on DFUC2021. We report the optimised results of
these key backbones with different strategies. Based on our observations, we
conclude that EfficientNetB0 with data augmentation and transfer learning
provided the best results for multi-class (4-class) classification with
macro-average Precision, Recall and F1-score of 0.57, 0.62 and 0.55,
respectively. In ischaemia and infection recognition, when trained on
one-versus-all, EfficientNetB0 achieved comparable results with the state of
the art. Finally, we interpret the results with statistical analysis and
Grad-CAM visualisation.</span>

learning. So far, however, it is largely unclear why the learned
representations generalize so effectively to a large variety of downstream
tasks. We here prove that feedforward models trained with objectives belonging
to the commonly used InfoNCE family learn to implicitly invert the underlying
generative model of the observed data. While the proofs make certain
statistical assumptions about the generative model, we observe empirically that
our findings hold even if these assumptions are severely violated. Our theory
highlights a fundamental connection between contrastive learning, generative
modeling, and nonlinear independent component analysis, thereby furthering our
understanding of the learned representations as well as providing a theoretical
foundation to derive more effective contrastive losses.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven
by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be
easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However,
various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model
configurations complicate the easy reuse of important innovations by a wide
audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and
simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural
language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for
challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing
toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of
disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces
layoutparser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA
research and applications. The core layoutparser library comes with a set of
simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for
layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing
tasks. To promote extensibility, layoutparser also incorporates a community
platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitization
pipelines. We demonstrate that layoutparser is helpful for both lightweight and
large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is
publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io/.</span>

                                        <span>Recent years have seen the introduction of a range of methods for post-hoc
explainability of image classifier predictions. However, these post-hoc
explanations may not always align perfectly with classifier predictions, which
poses a significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such
explanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve alignment
between model predictions and explanation method that is both agnostic to the
model and explanation classes and which does not require ground truth
explanations. We achieve this through a novel explanation-driven data
augmentation (EDDA) method that augments the training data with occlusions of
existing data stemming from model-explanations; this is based on the simple
motivating principle that occluding salient regions for the model prediction
should decrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding
non-salient regions should not change the prediction -- if the model and
explainer are aligned. To verify that this augmentation method improves model
and explainer alignment, we evaluate the methodology on a variety of datasets,
image classification models, and explanation methods. We verify in all cases
that our explanation-driven data augmentation method improves alignment of the
model and explanation in comparison to no data augmentation and non-explanation
driven data augmentation methods. In conclusion, this approach provides a novel
model- and explainer-agnostic methodology for improving alignment between model
predictions and explanations, which we see as a critical step forward for
practical deployment and debugging of image classification models.</span>

                                        <span>Background and Objective: Manually annotating gastric X-ray images for
gastritis detection is time-consuming and expensive because it typically
requires expert knowledge. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning
method to solve this problem. This study aims to verify the effectiveness of
the proposed self-supervised learning method in gastritis detection using a few
annotated gastric X-ray images. Methods: In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised learning method that can perform explicit self-supervised
learning and learn discriminative representations from gastric X-ray images.
Models trained with the proposed method were fine-tuned on datasets with a few
annotated gastric X-ray images. For comparison, several state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning methods, i.e., containing SimSiam, BYOL, PIRL-jigsaw,
PIRL-rotation, and SimCLR, were compared with the proposed method. Furthermore,
two baseline methods, one pretrained on ImageNet and the other trained from
scratch, were compared with the proposed method. Results: The proposed method&#x27;s
harmonic mean score of sensitivity and specificity after fine-tuning with the
annotated data of 10, 20, 30, and 40 patients were 0.875, 0.911, 0.915, and
0.931, respectively. The proposed method outperformed all comparative methods,
including the five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning and two baseline
methods. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method
in gastritis detection with a few annotated gastric X-ray images. Conclusions:
The proposed self-supervised learning method shows potential for clinical use
in gastritis detection using a few annotated gastric X-ray images.</span>

images, we propose to formulate the problem as the human-machine Continual
Curation of images and animal identities. This is an open world recognition
problem, where most new animals enter the system after its algorithms are
initially trained and deployed. Continual Curation, as defined here, requires
(1) an improvement in the effectiveness of current recognition methods, (2) a
pairwise verification algorithm that allows the possibility of no decision, and
(3) an algorithmic decision mechanism that seeks human input to guide the
curation process. Error metrics must evaluate the ability of recognition
algorithms to identify not only animals that have been seen just once or twice
but also recognize new animals not in the database. An important measure of
overall system performance is accuracy as a function of the amount of human
input required.</span>

intelligent agents such as robots to perform a variety of tasks via planning
with the model. However, while existing video prediction models have produced
promising results on small datasets, they suffer from severe underfitting when
trained on large and diverse datasets. To address this underfitting challenge,
we first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is
often bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep
hierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by
capturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end
optimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that
greedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously
address both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of
large-scale video prediction. We introduce Greedy Hierarchical Variational
Autoencoders (GHVAEs), a method that learns high-fidelity video predictions by
greedily training each level of a hierarchical autoencoder. In comparison to
state-of-the-art models, GHVAEs provide 17-55% gains in prediction performance
on four video datasets, a 35-40% higher success rate on real robot tasks, and
can improve performance monotonically by simply adding more modules.</span>

its theoretical foundations, mostly for (nonlinear) deep neural networks (DNNs)
that are probably the most prominent machine learning models for large-scale
data in the community over the past decade. We generalize the formulation of
classification margins from classical research to latest DNNs, summarize
theoretical connections between the margin, network generalization, and
robustness, and introduce recent efforts in enlarging the margins for DNNs
comprehensively. Since the viewpoint of different methods is discrepant, we
categorize them into groups for ease of comparison and discussion in the paper.
Hopefully, our discussions and overview inspire new research work in the
community that aim to improve the performance of DNNs, and we also point to
directions where the large margin principle can be verified to provide
theoretical evidence why certain regularizations for DNNs function well in
practice. We managed to shorten the paper such that the crucial spirit of large
margin learning and related methods are better emphasized.</span>

affecting over 70 million people. The cumbersome Standard Automated Perimetry
(SAP) test is most frequently used to detect visual loss due to glaucoma. Due
to the SAP test&#x27;s innate difficulty and its high test-retest variability, we
propose the RetiNerveNet, a deep convolutional recursive neural network for
obtaining estimates of the SAP visual field. RetiNerveNet uses information from
the more objective Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT).
RetiNerveNet attempts to trace-back the arcuate convergence of the retinal
nerve fibers, starting from the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness
around the optic disc, to estimate individual age-corrected 24-2 SAP values.
Recursive passes through the proposed network sequentially yield estimates of
the visual locations progressively farther from the optic disc. While all the
methods used for our experiments exhibit lower performance for the advanced
disease group, the proposed network is observed to be more accurate than all
the baselines for estimating the individual visual field values. We further
augment RetiNerveNet to additionally predict the SAP Mean Deviation values and
also create an ensemble of RetiNerveNets that further improves the performance,
by increasingly weighting-up underrepresented parts of the training data.</span>

networks and have achieved many promising results. However, on the more
challenging binary neural networks (BNNs), this task has not yet been fully
explored in the community. In this paper, we focus on this more difficult
scenario: learning networks where both weights and activations are binary,
meanwhile, without any human annotated labels. We observe that the commonly
used contrastive objective is not satisfying on BNNs for competitive accuracy,
since the backbone network contains relatively limited capacity and
representation ability. Hence instead of directly applying existing
self-supervised methods, which cause a severe decline in performance, we
present a novel guided learning paradigm from real-valued to distill binary
networks on the final prediction distribution, to minimize the loss and obtain
desirable accuracy. Our proposed method can boost the simple contrastive
learning baseline by an absolute gain of 5.5~15% on BNNs. We further reveal
that it is difficult for BNNs to recover the similar predictive distributions
as real-valued models when training without labels. Thus, how to calibrate them
is key to address the degradation in performance. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the large-scale ImageNet and downstream datasets. Our method
achieves substantial improvement over the simple contrastive learning baseline,
and is even comparable to many mainstream supervised BNN methods. Code is

                                        <span>Contrastive loss and its variants have become very popular recently for
learning visual representations without supervision. In this work, we study
three intriguing properties of contrastive learning. We first generalize the
standard contrastive loss to a broader family of losses, and we find that
various instantiations of the generalized loss perform similarly under the
presence of a multi-layer non-linear projection head. We then study if
instance-based contrastive learning (such as in SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, and so on,
which are based on global image representation) can learn well on images with
multiple objects present. We find that meaningful hierarchical local features
can be learned despite the fact that these objectives operate on global
instance-level features.

Finally, we study an intriguing phenomenon of feature suppression among
competing features shared across augmented views, such as &quot;color distribution&quot;
vs &quot;object class&quot;. We construct datasets with explicit and controllable
competing features, and show that, for contrastive learning, a few bits of
easy-to-learn shared features can suppress, and even fully prevent, the
learning of other sets of competing features. In scenarios where there are
multiple objects in an image, the dominant object would suppress the learning
of smaller objects. Existing contrastive learning methods critically rely on
data augmentation to favor certain sets of features over others, and face
potential limitation for scenarios where existing augmentations cannot fully
address the feature suppression. This poses open challenges to existing
contrastive learning techniques.</span>

                                        <span>This paper provides a novel approach to stitching surface images of
rotationally symmetric parts. It presents a process pipeline that uses a
feature-based stitching approach to create a distortion-free and true-to-life
image from a video file. The developed process thus enables, for example,
condition monitoring without having to view many individual images. For
validation purposes, this will be demonstrated in the paper using the concrete
example of a worn ball screw drive spindle. The developed algorithm aims at
reproducing the functional principle of a line scan camera system, whereby the
physical measuring systems are replaced by a feature-based approach. For
evaluation of the stitching algorithms, metrics are used, some of which have
only been developed in this work or have been supplemented by test procedures
already in use. The applicability of the developed algorithm is not only
limited to machine tool spindles. Instead, the developed method allows a
general approach to the surface inspection of various rotationally symmetric
components and can therefore be used in a variety of industrial applications.
Deep-learning-based detection Algorithms can easily be implemented to generate
a complete pipeline for failure detection and condition monitoring on
rotationally symmetric parts.</span>

                                        <span>Building facial analysis systems that generalize to extreme variations in
lighting and facial expressions is a challenging problem that can potentially
be alleviated using natural-looking synthetic data. Towards that, we propose
LEGAN, a novel synthesis framework that leverages perceptual quality judgments
for jointly manipulating lighting and expressions in face images, without
requiring paired training data. LEGAN disentangles the lighting and expression
subspaces and performs transformations in the feature space before upscaling to
the desired output image. The fidelity of the synthetic image is further
refined by integrating a perceptual quality estimation model, trained with face
images rendered using multiple synthesis methods and their crowd-sourced
naturalness ratings, into the LEGAN framework as an auxiliary discriminator.
Using objective metrics like FID and LPIPS, LEGAN is shown to generate higher
quality face images when compared with popular GAN models like StarGAN and
StarGAN-v2 for lighting and expression synthesis. We also conduct a perceptual
study using images synthesized by LEGAN and other GAN models and show the
correlation between our quality estimation and visual fidelity. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGAN as training data augmenter for
expression recognition and face verification tasks.</span>

challenging due to the irregularity of 3D point cloud data. In this paper, we
propose Pointformer, a Transformer backbone designed for 3D point clouds to
learn features effectively. Specifically, a Local Transformer module is
employed to model interactions among points in a local region, which learns
context-dependent region features at an object level. A Global Transformer is
designed to learn context-aware representations at the scene level. To further
capture the dependencies among multi-scale representations, we propose
Local-Global Transformer to integrate local features with global features from
higher resolution. In addition, we introduce an efficient coordinate refinement
module to shift down-sampled points closer to object centroids, which improves
object proposal generation. We use Pointformer as the backbone for
state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate significant
improvements over original models on both indoor and outdoor datasets.</span>

                                        <span>There has recently been significant interest in training reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in vision-based environments. This poses many challenges,
such as high dimensionality and potential for observational overfitting through
spurious correlations. A promising approach to solve both of these problems is
a self-attention bottleneck, which provides a simple and effective framework
for learning high performing policies, even in the presence of distractions.
However, due to poor scalability of attention architectures, these methods do
not scale beyond low resolution visual inputs, using large patches (thus small
attention matrices). In this paper we make use of new efficient attention
algorithms, recently shown to be highly effective for Transformers, and
demonstrate that these new techniques can be applied in the RL setting. This
allows our attention-based controllers to scale to larger visual inputs, and
facilitate the use of smaller patches, even individual pixels, improving
generalization. In addition, we propose a new efficient algorithm approximating
softmax attention with what we call hybrid random features, leveraging the
theory of angular kernels. We show theoretically and empirically that hybrid
random features is a promising approach when using attention for vision-based
RL.</span>

                                        <span>A deraining network can be interpreted as a conditional generator that aims
at removing rain streaks from image. Most existing image deraining methods
ignore model errors caused by uncertainty that reduces embedding quality.
Unlike existing image deraining methods that embed low-quality features into
the model directly, we replace low-quality features by latent high-quality
features. The spirit of closed-loop feedback in the automatic control field is
borrowed to obtain latent high-quality features. A new method for error
detection and feature compensation is proposed to address model errors.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets as well as specific real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art
methods. Code is available at: \\ https://github.com/LI-Hao-SJTU/DerainRLNet</span>

contains only one observation of the scene at any point in time. The 3D
geometry of a scene can be legitimately represented in numerous ways since
varying geometry (motion) can be explained with varying appearance and vice
versa. We address this ambiguity by constraining the time-varying geometry of
our dynamic scene representation using the scene depth estimated from video

At extremely low bit-rates, standard video coding schemes suffer from
unpleasant reconstruction artifacts such as blocking, ringing etc. Existing
learned neural approaches to video compression have achieved reasonable success
on reducing the bit-rate for efficient transmission and reduce the impact of
artifacts to an extent. However, they still tend to produce blurred results
under extreme compression. In this paper, we present a deep adversarial learned
video compression model that minimizes an auxiliary adversarial distortion
objective. We find this adversarial objective to correlate better with human
perceptual quality judgement relative to traditional quality metrics such as
MS-SSIM and PSNR. Our experiments using a state-of-the-art learned video

vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. Among the variety of techniques
introduced to surmount this inherent weakness, adversarial training has emerged
as the most common and efficient strategy to achieve robustness. Typically,
this is achieved by balancing robust and natural objectives. In this work, we
aim to achieve better trade-off between robust and natural performances by
enforcing a domain-invariant feature representation. We present a new
adversarial training method, Domain Invariant Adversarial Learning (DIAL),
which learns a feature representation which is both robust and domain
invariant. DIAL uses a variant of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) on
the natural domain and its corresponding adversarial domain. In a case where
the source domain consists of natural examples and the target domain is the
adversarially perturbed examples, our method learns a feature representation
constrained not to discriminate between the natural and adversarial examples,
and can therefore achieve a more robust representation. Our experiments
indicate that our method improves both robustness and natural accuracy, when
compared to current state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.</span>

                                        <span>Most existing approaches for visual localization either need a detailed 3D
model of the environment or, in the case of learning-based methods, must be
retrained for each new scene. This can either be very expensive or simply
impossible for large, unknown environments, for example in search-and-rescue
scenarios. Although there are learning-based approaches that operate
scene-agnostically, the generalization capability of these methods is still
outperformed by classical approaches. In this paper, we present an approach
that can generalize to new scenes by applying specific changes to the model
architecture, including an extended regression part, the use of hierarchical
correlation layers, and the exploitation of scale and uncertainty information.
Our approach outperforms the 5-point algorithm using SIFT features on equally
big images and additionally surpasses all previous learning-based approaches
that were trained on different data. It is also superior to most of the
approaches that were specifically trained on the respective scenes. We also
evaluate our approach in a scenario where only very few reference images are
available, showing that under such more realistic conditions our learning-based
approach considerably exceeds both existing learning-based and classical
methods.</span>

                                        <span>Autonomous driving is regarded as one of the most promising remedies to
shield human beings from severe crashes. To this end, 3D object detection
serves as the core basis of such perception system especially for the sake of
path planning, motion prediction, collision avoidance, etc. Generally, stereo
or monocular images with corresponding 3D point clouds are already standard
layout for 3D object detection, out of which point clouds are increasingly
prevalent with accurate depth information being provided. Despite existing
efforts, 3D object detection on point clouds is still in its infancy due to
high sparseness and irregularity of point clouds by nature, misalignment view
between camera view and LiDAR bird&#x27;s eye of view for modality synergies,
occlusions and scale variations at long distances, etc. Recently, profound
progress has been made in 3D object detection, with a large body of literature
being investigated to address this vision task. As such, we present a
comprehensive review of the latest progress in this field covering all the main
topics including sensors, fundamentals, and the recent state-of-the-art
detection methods with their pros and cons. Furthermore, we introduce metrics
and provide quantitative comparisons on popular public datasets. The avenues
for future work are going to be judiciously identified after an in-deep
analysis of the surveyed works. Finally, we conclude this paper.</span>

                                        <span>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely applied in different
scenarios thanks to the development of deep neural networks. The original GAN
was proposed based on the non-parametric assumption of the infinite capacity of
networks. However, it is still unknown whether GANs can generate realistic
samples without any prior information. Due to the overconfident assumption,
many issues remain unaddressed in GANs&#x27; training, such as non-convergence, mode
collapses, gradient vanishing. Regularization and normalization are common
methods of introducing prior information to stabilize training and improve
discrimination. Although a handful number of regularization and normalization
methods have been proposed for GANs, to the best of our knowledge, there exists
no comprehensive survey which primarily focuses on objectives and development
of these methods, apart from some in-comprehensive and limited scope studies.
In this work, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the regularization and
normalization techniques from different perspectives of GANs training. First,
we systematically describe different perspectives of GANs training and thus
obtain the different objectives of regularization and normalization. Based on
these objectives, we propose a new taxonomy. Furthermore, we compare the
performance of the mainstream methods on different datasets and investigate the
regularization and normalization techniques that have been frequently employed
in SOTA GANs. Finally, we highlight potential future directions of research in
this domain.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to
circumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial
perturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored
to defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g.
$\ell_\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these
methods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the
system. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously
significantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly
learns to generate noise to improve the model&#x27;s robustness against multiple
types of attacks. Its key component is Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs
optimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps
lower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples
generated by MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across
multiple perturbations. We validate the robustness of models trained by our
scheme on various datasets and against a wide variety of perturbations,
demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines across multiple
perturbations with a marginal computational cost.</span>

                                        <span>Trajectory prediction is one of the key capabilities for robots to safely
navigate and interact with pedestrians. Critical insights from human intention
and behavioral patterns need to be integrated to effectively forecast long-term
pedestrian behavior. Thus, we propose a framework incorporating a Mutable
Intention Filter and a Warp LSTM (MIF-WLSTM) to simultaneously estimate human
intention and perform trajectory prediction. The Mutable Intention Filter is
inspired by particle filtering and genetic algorithms, where particles
represent intention hypotheses that can be mutated throughout the pedestrian
motion. Instead of predicting sequential displacement over time, our Warp LSTM
learns to generate offsets on a full trajectory predicted by a nominal
intention-aware linear model, which considers the intention hypotheses during
filtering process. Through experiments on a publicly available dataset, we show
that our method outperforms baseline approaches and demonstrate the robust
performance of our method under abnormal intention-changing scenarios. Code is

examples to complement the testing set for generalization performance
evaluation of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we propose a practical
framework ContRE (The word &quot;contre&quot; means &quot;against&quot; or &quot;versus&quot; in French.)
that uses Contrastive examples for DNN geneRalization performance Estimation.
Specifically, ContRE follows the assumption in contrastive learning that robust
DNN models with good generalization performance are capable of extracting a
consistent set of features and making consistent predictions from the same
image under varying data transformations. Incorporating with a set of
randomized strategies for well-designed data transformations over the training
set, ContRE adopts classification errors and Fisher ratios on the generated
contrastive examples to assess and analyze the generalization performance of
deep models in complement with a testing set. To show the effectiveness and the
efficiency of ContRE, extensive experiments have been done using various DNN
models on three open source benchmark datasets with thorough ablation studies
and applicability analyses. Our experiment results confirm that (1) behaviors
of deep models on contrastive examples are strongly correlated to what on the
testing set, and (2) ContRE is a robust measure of generalization performance
complementing to the testing set in various settings.</span>

be aligned for better adaptation is under-explored. In this paper, we propose
an effective Task-oriented Alignment (ToAlign) for unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA). We study what features should be aligned across domains and
propose to make the domain alignment proactively serve classification by
performing feature decomposition and alignment under the guidance of the prior
knowledge induced from the classification taskitself. Particularly, we
explicitly decompose a feature in the source domain intoa
task-related/discriminative feature that should be aligned, and a
task-irrelevant feature that should be avoided/ignored, based on the
classification meta-knowledge. Extensive experimental results on various
benchmarks (e.g., Office-Home, Visda-2017, and DomainNet) under different
domain adaptation settings demonstrate theeffectiveness of ToAlign which helps
achieve the state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>Despite recent progress of automatic medical image segmentation techniques,
fully automatic results usually fail to meet the clinical use and typically
require further refinement. In this work, we propose a quality-aware memory
network for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images. Provided by user
guidance on an arbitrary slice, an interaction network is firstly employed to
obtain an initial 2D segmentation. The quality-aware memory network
subsequently propagates the initial segmentation estimation bidirectionally
over the entire volume. Subsequent refinement based on additional user guidance
on other slices can be incorporated in the same manner. To further facilitate
interactive segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest
the next slice to segment based on the current segmentation quality of each
slice. The proposed network has two appealing characteristics: 1) The
memory-augmented network offers the ability to quickly encode past segmentation
information, which will be retrieved for the segmentation of other slices; 2)
The quality assessment module enables the model to directly estimate the
qualities of segmentation predictions, which allows an active learning paradigm
where users preferentially label the lowest-quality slice for multi-round
refinement. The proposed network leads to a robust interactive segmentation
engine, which can generalize well to various types of user annotations (e.g.,
scribbles, boxes). Experimental results on various medical datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our approach in comparison with existing techniques.</span>

transportation issues.The cost of data collection increases significantly when
sophisticated machines are used to collect data. Due to this constraint, State
Departments of Transportation struggles to collect consistent data for
analyzing and resolving transportation problems in a timely manner. Recent
advancements in the sensors integrated into smartphones have resulted in a more
affordable method of data collection.The primary objective of this study is to
develop and implement a smartphone application for data collection.The
currently designed app consists of three major modules: a frontend graphical
user interface (GUI), a sensor module, and a backend module. While the frontend
user interface enables interaction with the app, the sensor modules collect
relevant data such as video and accelerometer readings while the app is in use.
The backend, on the other hand, is made up of firebase storage, which is used
to store the gathered data.In comparison to other developed apps for collecting
pavement information, this current app is not overly reliant on the internet
enabling the app to be used in areas of restricted internet access.The
developed application was evaluated by collecting data on the i70W highway
connecting Columbia, Missouri, and Kansas City, Missouri.The data was analyzed
for a variety of purposes, including calculating the International Roughness
Index (IRI), identifying pavement distresses, and understanding driver&#x27;s
behaviour and environment .The results of the application indicate that the
data collected by the app is of high quality.</span>

                                        <span>Scene graph generation (SGG) is to detect entity pairs with their relations
in an image. Existing SGG approaches often use multi-stage pipelines to
decompose this task into object detection, relation graph construction, and
dense or dense-to-sparse relation prediction. Instead, from a perspective on
SGG as a direct set prediction, this paper presents a simple, sparse, and
unified framework for relation detection, termed as Structured Sparse R-CNN.
The key to our method is a set of learnable triplet queries and structured
triplet detectors which could be jointly optimized from the training set in an
end-to-end manner. Specifically, the triplet queries encode the general prior
for entity pair locations, categories, and their relations, and provide an
initial guess of relation detection for subsequent refinement. The triplet
detector presents a cascaded dynamic head design to progressively refine the
results of relation detection. In addition, to relieve the training difficulty
of Structured Sparse R-CNN, we propose a relaxed and enhanced training strategy
based on knowledge distillation from a Siamese Sparse R-CNN. We also propose
adaptive focusing parameter and average logit approach for imbalance data
distribution. We perform experiments on two benchmarks: Visual Genome and Open
Images, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, we perform in-depth ablation studies
to provide insights on our structured modeling in triplet detector design and
training strategies.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method, called NeuS, for
reconstructing objects and scenes with high fidelity from 2D image inputs.
Existing neural surface reconstruction approaches, such as DVR and IDR, require
foreground mask as supervision, easily get trapped in local minima, and
therefore struggle with the reconstruction of objects with severe
self-occlusion or thin structures. Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel
view synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce
a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly
complex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned
implicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface
constraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surface
as the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a new
volume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe that
the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.
bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that
is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more
accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments
on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the
state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for
objects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.</span>

                                        <span>Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character
recognition (OCR) results into plain texts and then utilized token-level entity
annotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it
expends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, and the
OCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper,
we propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,
Copy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to
simultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)
a weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information
sequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which
contains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key
information sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input
or predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly
tag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new
state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves
its effectiveness.</span>

of supervoxels into image regions. Here we describe a distributed algorithm
capable of handling a tremendous number of supervoxels. The algorithm works
recursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are processed
independently in parallel by multiple workers. At each round of the recursive
procedure, the chunk size in all dimensions are doubled until a single chunk
encompasses the entire image. The final result is provably independent of the
chunking scheme, and the same as if the entire image were processed without
division into chunks. This is nontrivial because a pair of adjacent regions is
scored by some statistical property (e.g. mean or median) of the affinities at
the interface, and the interface may extend over arbitrarily many chunks. The
trick is to delay merge decisions for regions that touch chunk boundaries, and
only complete them in a later round after the regions are fully contained
within a chunk. We demonstrate the algorithm by clustering an affinity graph
with over 1.5 trillion edges between 135 billion supervoxels derived from a 3D
electron microscopic brain image.</span>

distribution generator (or data generator) and a metric generator. In our
framework, we view the real data set as some manifold embedded in a
high-dimensional Euclidean space. The distribution generator aims at generating
samples that follow some distribution condensed around the real data manifold.
It is achieved by matching two sets of points using their geometric shape
descriptors, such as centroid and $p$-diameter, with learned distance metric;
the metric generator utilizes both real data and generated samples to learn a
distance metric which is close to some intrinsic geodesic distance on the real
data manifold. The produced distance metric is further used for manifold
matching. The two networks are learned simultaneously during the training
process. We apply the approach on both unsupervised and supervised learning
tasks: in unconditional image generation task, the proposed method obtains
competitive results compared with existing generative models; in
super-resolution task, we incorporate the framework in perception-based models
and improve visual qualities by producing samples with more natural textures.
Both theoretical analysis and real data experiments guarantee the feasibility
and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</span>

                                        <span>Backpropagation image saliency aims at explaining model predictions by
estimating model-centric importance of individual pixels in the input. However,
class-insensitivity of the earlier layers in a network only allows saliency
computation with low resolution activation maps of the deeper layers, resulting
in compromised image saliency. Remedifying this can lead to sanity failures. We
propose CAMERAS, a technique to compute high-fidelity backpropagation saliency
maps without requiring any external priors and preserving the map sanity. Our
method systematically performs multi-scale accumulation and fusion of the
activation maps and backpropagated gradients to compute precise saliency maps.
From accurate image saliency to articulation of relative importance of input
features for different models, and precise discrimination between model
perception of visually similar objects, our high-resolution mapping offers
multiple novel insights into the black-box deep visual models, which are
presented in the paper. We also demonstrate the utility of our saliency maps in
adversarial setup by drastically reducing the norm of attack signals by
focusing them on the precise regions identified by our maps. Our method also
inspires new evaluation metrics and a sanity check for this developing research
direction. Code is available here https://github.com/VisMIL/CAMERAS</span>

conditioned inputs such as semantic segmentation and edge maps, generating
high-fidelity realistic images with reference styles remains a grand challenge
in conditional image-to-image translation. This paper presents a general image
translation framework that incorporates optimal transport for feature alignment
between conditional inputs and style exemplars in image translation. The
introduction of optimal transport mitigates the constraint of many-to-one
feature matching significantly while building up accurate semantic
correspondences between conditional inputs and exemplars. We design a novel
unbalanced optimal transport to address the transport between features with
deviational distributions which exists widely between conditional inputs and
exemplars. In addition, we design a semantic-activation normalization scheme
that injects style features of exemplars into the image translation process
successfully. Extensive experiments over multiple image translation tasks show
that our method achieves superior image translation qualitatively and
quantitatively as compared with the state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Super-resolution (SR) is a one-to-many task with multiple possible solutions.
However, previous works were not concerned about this characteristic. For a
one-to-many pipeline, the generator should be able to generate multiple
estimates of the reconstruction, and not be penalized for generating similar
and equally realistic images. To achieve this, we propose adding weighted
pixel-wise noise after every Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) to enable
the generator to generate various images. We modify the strict content loss to
not penalize the stochastic variation in reconstructed images as long as it has
consistent content. Additionally, we observe that there are out-of-focus
regions in the DIV2K, DIV8K datasets that provide unhelpful guidelines. We
filter blurry regions in the training data using the method of [10]. Finally,
we modify the discriminator to receive the low-resolution image as a reference
image along with the target image to provide better feedback to the generator.
Using our proposed methods, we were able to improve the performance of ESRGAN
in x4 perceptual SR and achieve the state-of-the-art LPIPS score in x16
perceptual extreme SR.</span>

structure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research.
Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic
table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis
community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it
remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a
variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a
table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different
table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table
cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the
table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition
as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table
graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.
Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection
branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial
location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on
three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph
annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
TGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made
publicly available.</span>

relevant information in videos through the identification of the most essential
and explanatory content while removing redundant video frames. In this paper,
we introduce the 3DST-UNet-RL framework for video summarization. A 3D
spatio-temporal U-Net is used to efficiently encode spatio-temporal information
of the input videos for downstream reinforcement learning (RL). An RL agent
learns from spatio-temporal latent scores and predicts actions for keeping or
rejecting a video frame in a video summary. We investigate if real/inflated 3D
spatio-temporal CNN features are better suited to learn representations from
videos than commonly used 2D image features. Our framework can operate in both,
a fully unsupervised mode and a supervised training mode. We analyse the impact
of prescribed summary lengths and show experimental evidence for the
effectiveness of 3DST-UNet-RL on two commonly used general video summarization
benchmarks. We also applied our method on a medical video summarization task.
The proposed video summarization method has the potential to save storage costs
of ultrasound screening videos as well as to increase efficiency when browsing
patient video data during retrospective analysis or audit without loosing
essential information</span>

                                        <span>We aim to tackle the challenging yet practical scenery image outpainting task
in this work. Recently, generative adversarial learning has significantly
advanced the image outpainting by producing semantic consistent content for the
given image. However, the existing methods always suffer from the blurry
texture and the artifacts of the generative part, making the overall
outpainting results lack authenticity. To overcome the weakness, this work
investigates a principle way to synthesize texture-rich results by borrowing
pixels from its neighbors (\ie, reference images), named
\textbf{Re}ference-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{O}utpainting (ReGO). Particularly,
the ReGO designs an Adaptive Content Selection (ACS) module to transfer the
pixel of reference images for texture compensating of the target one. To
prevent the style of the generated part from being affected by the reference
images, a style ranking loss is further proposed to augment the ReGO to
synthesize style-consistent results. Extensive experiments on two popular
benchmarks, NS6K~\cite{yangzx} and NS8K~\cite{wang}, well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our ReGO.</span>

                                        <span>Person search has recently emerged as a challenging task that jointly
addresses pedestrian detection and person re-identification. Existing
approaches follow a fully supervised setting where both bounding box and
identity annotations are available. However, annotating identities is
labor-intensive, limiting the practicability and scalability of current
frameworks. This paper inventively considers weakly supervised person search
with only bounding box annotations. We proposed the first framework to address
this novel task, namely Context-Guided Person Search (CGPS), by investigating
three levels of context clues (i.e., detection, memory and scene) in
unconstrained natural images. The first two are employed to promote local and
global discriminative capabilities, while the latter enhances clustering
accuracy. Despite its simple design, our CGPS boosts the baseline model by 8.3%
in mAP on CUHK-SYSU. Surprisingly, it even achieves comparable performance to
two-step person search models, while displaying higher efficiency. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ljpadam/CGPS.</span>

resolution for pixel level prediction. In such schema, upsample technique is
vital in maintaining information for better performance. In this paper, we
present a new upsample approach, Attention Upsample (AU), that could serve as
general upsample method and be incorporated into any segmentation model that
possesses lateral connections. AU leverages pixel-level attention to model long
range dependency and global information for better reconstruction. It consists
of Attention Decoder (AD) and bilinear upsample as residual connection to
complement the upsampled features. AD adopts the idea of decoder from
transformer which upsamples features conditioned on local and detailed
information from contracting path. Moreover, considering the extensive memory
and computation cost of pixel-level attention, we further propose to use window
attention scheme to restrict attention computation in local windows instead of
global range. Incorporating window attention, we denote our decoder as Window
Attention Decoder (WAD) and our upsample method as Window Attention Upsample
(WAU). We test our method on classic U-Net structure with lateral connection to
deliver information from contracting path and achieve state-of-the-arts
performance on Synapse (80.30 DSC and 23.12 HD) and MSD Brain (74.75 DSC)

                                        <span>The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven
research towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using
only image-level, point, or box labels. The lack of dense scene representation
requires methods to increase complexity to obtain additional semantic
information about the scene, often done through multiple stages of training and
refinement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models leverage image-level labels
to produce class activation maps (CAMs) which go through multiple stages of
refinement before they are thresholded to make pseudo-masks for supervision.
The multi-stage approach is computationally expensive, and dependency on
image-level labels for CAMs generation lacks generalizability to more complex
scenes. In contrary, our method offers a single-stage approach generalizable to
arbitrary dataset, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on
pre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize
point annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined
and filtered features. While our method requires point annotations that are
only slightly more expensive than image-level annotations, we are to
demonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as
significantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets
(CRAID, CityPersons, IAD).</span>

                                        <span>In recent times, deep learning-based steganalysis classifiers became popular
due to their state-of-the-art performance. Most deep steganalysis classifiers
usually extract noise residuals using high-pass filters as preprocessing steps
and feed them to their deep model for classification. It is observed that
recent steganographic embedding does not always restrict their embedding in the
high-frequency zone; instead, they distribute it as per embedding policy.
Therefore, besides noise residual, learning the embedding zone is another
challenging task. In this work, unlike the conventional approaches, the
proposed model first extracts the noise residual using learned denoising
kernels to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. After preprocessing, the sparse
noise residuals are fed to a novel Multi-Contextual Convolutional Neural
Network (M-CNET) that uses heterogeneous context size to learn the sparse and
low-amplitude representation of noise residuals. The model performance is
further improved by incorporating the Self-Attention module to focus on the
areas prone to steganalytic embedding. A set of comprehensive experiments is
performed to show the proposed scheme&#x27;s efficacy over the prior arts. Besides,
an ablation study is given to justify the contribution of various modules of
the proposed architecture.</span>

                                        <span>In this work we present a novel solution for Video Instance
Segmentation(VIS), that is automatically generating instance level segmentation
masks along with object class and tracking them in a video. Our method improves
the masks from segmentation and propagation branches in an online manner using
the Mask Selection Network (MSN) hence limiting the noise accumulation during
mask tracking. We propose an effective design of MSN by using patch-based
convolutional neural network. The network is able to distinguish between very
subtle differences between the masks and choose the better masks out of the
associated masks accurately. Further, we make use of temporal consistency and
process the video sequences in both forward and reverse manner as a post
processing step to recover lost objects. The proposed method can be used to
adapt any video object segmentation method for the task of VIS. Our method
achieves a score of 49.1 mAP on 2021 YouTube-VIS Challenge and was ranked third
place among more than 30 global teams. Our code will be available at

                                        <span>Detection in large-scale scenes is a challenging problem due to small objects
and extreme scale variation. It is essential to focus on the image regions of
small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Zoom (AdaZoom)
network as a selective magnifier with flexible shape and focal length to
adaptively zoom the focus regions for object detection. Based on policy
gradient, we construct a reinforcement learning framework for focus region
generation, with the reward formulated by object distributions. The scales and
aspect ratios of the generated regions are adaptive to the scales and
distribution of objects inside. We apply variable magnification according to
the scale of the region for adaptive multi-scale detection. We further propose
collaborative training to complementarily promote the performance of AdaZoom
and the detection network. To validate the effectiveness, we conduct extensive
experiments on VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and DOTA datasets. The experiments show
AdaZoom brings a consistent and significant improvement over different
detection networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on these datasets,
especially outperforming the existing methods by AP of 4.64% on Vis-Drone2019.</span>

                                        <span>Works on lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) and single-shot network pruning
(SNIP) have raised a lot of attention currently on post-training pruning
(iterative magnitude pruning), and before-training pruning (pruning at
initialization). The former method suffers from an extremely large computation
cost and the latter category of methods usually struggles with insufficient
performance. In comparison, during-training pruning, a class of pruning methods
that simultaneously enjoys the training/inference efficiency and the comparable
performance, temporarily, has been less explored. To better understand
during-training pruning, we quantitatively study the effect of pruning
throughout training from the perspective of pruning plasticity (the ability of
the pruned networks to recover the original performance). Pruning plasticity
can help explain several other empirical observations about neural network
pruning in literature. We further find that pruning plasticity can be
substantially improved by injecting a brain-inspired mechanism called
neuroregeneration, i.e., to regenerate the same number of connections as
pruned. Based on the insights from pruning plasticity, we design a novel
gradual magnitude pruning (GMP) method, named gradual pruning with zero-cost
neuroregeneration (GraNet), and its dynamic sparse training (DST) variant
(GraNet-ST). Both of them advance state of the art. Perhaps most impressively,
the latter for the first time boosts the sparse-to-sparse training performance
over various dense-to-sparse methods by a large margin with ResNet-50 on
ImageNet. We will release all codes.</span>

                                        <span>To assist human drivers and autonomous vehicles in assessing crash risks,
driving scene analysis using dash cameras on vehicles and deep learning
algorithms is of paramount importance. Although these technologies are
increasingly available, driving scene analysis for this purpose still remains a
challenge. This is mainly due to the lack of annotated large image datasets for
analyzing crash risk indicators and crash likelihood, and the lack of an
effective method to extract lots of required information from complex driving
scenes. To fill the gap, this paper develops a scene analysis system. The
Multi-Net of the system includes two multi-task neural networks that perform
scene classification to provide four labels for each scene. The DeepLab v3 and
YOLO v3 are combined by the system to detect and locate risky pedestrians and
the nearest vehicles. All identified information can provide the situational
awareness to autonomous vehicles or human drivers for identifying crash risks
from the surrounding traffic. To address the scarcity of annotated image
datasets for studying traffic crashes, two completely new datasets have been
developed by this paper and made available to the public, which were proved to
be effective in training the proposed deep neural networks. The paper further
evaluates the performance of the Multi-Net and the efficiency of the developed
system. Comprehensive scene analysis is further illustrated with representative
examples. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system and
datasets for driving scene analysis, and their supportiveness for crash risk
assessment and crash prevention.</span>

authority to cite while drafting decisions. In this paper, we develop a
citation recommendation tool that can help improve efficiency in the process of
opinion drafting. We train four types of machine learning models, including a
citation-list based method (collaborative filtering) and three context-based
methods (text similarity, BiLSTM and RoBERTa classifiers). Our experiments show
that leveraging local textual context improves recommendation, and that deep
neural models achieve decent performance. We show that non-deep text-based
methods benefit from access to structured case metadata, but deep models only
benefit from such access when predicting from context of insufficient length.
We also find that, even after extensive training, RoBERTa does not outperform a
recurrent neural model, despite its benefits of pretraining. Our behavior
analysis of the RoBERTa model further shows that predictive performance is
stable across time and citation classes.</span>

                                        <span>With the development of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technologies, edge devices are witnessed to generate data at unprecedented
volume. The Edge Intelligence (EI) has led to the emergence of edge devices in
various application domains. The EI can provide efficient services to
delay-sensitive applications, where the edge devices are deployed as edge nodes
to host the majority of execution, which can effectively manage services and
improve service discovery efficiency. The multilevel index model is a
well-known model used for indexing service, such a model is being introduced
and optimized in the edge environments to efficiently services discovery whilst
managing large volumes of data. However, effectively updating the multilevel
index model by adding new services timely and precisely in the dynamic Edge
Computing environments is still a challenge. Addressing this issue, this paper
proposes a designated key selection method to improve the efficiency of adding
services in the multilevel index models. Our experimental results show that in
the partial index and the full index of multilevel index model, our method
reduces the service addition time by around 84% and 76%, respectively when
compared with the original key selection method and by around 78% and 66%,
respectively when compared with the random selection method. Our proposed
method significantly improves the service addition efficiency in the multilevel
index model, when compared with existing state-of-the-art key selection
methods, without compromising the service retrieval stability to any notable
level.</span>

                                        <span>Industrial processes produce a considerable volume of data and thus
information. Whether it is structured sensory data or semi- to unstructured
textual data, the knowledge that can be derived from it is critical to the
sustainable development of the industrial process. A key challenge of this
sustainability is the intelligent management of the generated data, as well as
the knowledge extracted from it, in order to utilize this knowledge for
improving future procedures. This challenge is a result of the tailored
documentation methods and domain-specific requirements, which include the need
for quick visibility of the documented knowledge. In this paper, we utilize the
expert knowledge documented in chip-design failure reports in supporting user
access to information that is relevant to a current chip design. Unstructured,
free, textual data in previous failure documentations provides a valuable
source of lessons-learned, which expert design-engineers have experienced,
solved and documented. To achieve a sustainable utilization of knowledge within
the company, not only the inherent knowledge has to be mined from unstructured
textual data, but also the relations between the lessons-learned, uncovering
potentially unknown links. In this research, a knowledge graph is constructed,
in order to represent and use the interconnections between reported design
failures. A search engine is developed and applied onto the graph to answer
queries. In contrast to mere keyword-based searching, the searchability of the
knowledge graph offers enhanced search results beyond direct matches and acts
as a mean for generating explainable results and result recommendations.
Results are provided to the design engineer through an interactive search
interface, in which, the feedback from the user is used to further optimize
relations for future iterations of the knowledge graph.</span>

interest due to the explosion in the amount of data in online applications. A
particular attention has been paid to collaborative filtering, which is the
most widely used in applications that involve information recommendations.
Collaborative filtering (CF) uses the known preference of a group of users to
make predictions and recommendations about the unknown preferences of other
users (recommendations are made based on the past behavior of users). First
introduced in the 1990s, a wide variety of increasingly successful models have
been proposed. Due to the success of machine learning techniques in many areas,
there has been a growing emphasis on the application of such algorithms in
recommendation systems. In this article, we present an overview of the CF
approaches for recommender systems, their two main categories, and their
evaluation metrics. We focus on the application of classical Machine Learning
algorithms to CF recommender systems by presenting their evolution from their
first use-cases to advanced Machine Learning models. We attempt to provide a
comprehensive and comparative overview of CF systems (with python
implementations) that can serve as a guideline for research and practice in
this area.</span>

                                        <span>Online gaming is growing faster than ever before, with increasing challenges
of providing better user experience. Recommender systems (RS) for online games
face unique challenges since they must fulfill players&#x27; distinct desires, at
different user levels, based on their action sequences of various action types.
Although many sequential RS already exist, they are mainly single-sequence,
single-task, and single-user-level. In this paper, we introduce a new
sequential recommendation model for multiple sequences, multiple tasks, and
multiple user levels (abbreviated as M$^3$Rec) in Tencent Games platform, which
can fully utilize complex data in online games. We leverage Graph Neural
Network and multi-task learning to design M$^3$Rec in order to model the
complex information in the heterogeneous sequential recommendation scenario of
Tencent Games. We verify the effectiveness of M$^3$Rec on three online games of
Tencent Games platform, in both offline and online evaluations. The results
show that M$^3$Rec successfully addresses the challenges of recommendation in
online games, and it generates superior recommendations compared with
state-of-the-art sequential recommendation approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character
recognition (OCR) results into plain texts and then utilized token-level entity
annotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it
expends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, and the
OCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper,
we propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,
Copy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to
simultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)
a weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information
sequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which
contains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key
information sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input
or predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly
tag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new
state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves
its effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Income verification is the problem of validating a person&#x27;s stated income
given basic identity information such as name, location, job title and
employer. It is widely used in the context of mortgage lending, rental
applications and other financial risk models. However, the current processes
surrounding verification involve significant human effort and document
gathering which can be both time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we
propose a novel model for verifying an individual&#x27;s income given very limited
identity information typically available in loan applications. Our model is a
combination of a deep neural network and hand-engineered features. The hand
engineered features are based upon matching the input information against
income records extracted automatically from various publicly available online
sources (e.g. payscale.com, H-1B filings, government employee salaries). We
conduct experiments on two data sets, one simulated from H-1B records and the
other from a real-world data set of peer-to-peer (P2P) loan applications
obtained from one of the world&#x27;s largest P2P lending platform. Our results show
a significant reduction in error of 3-6% relative to several strong baselines.
We also perform ablation studies to demonstrate that a combined model is indeed
necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task.</span>

might not suffice. This throws a number of recent studies on deep
learning-based recommendation algorithms, and classic non-deep-learning
algorithms using such a metric, into jeopardy. In this work, we thoroughly
investigate the relationship between the sampling and global top-$K$ Hit-Ratio
(HR, or Recall), originally proposed by Koren[2] and extensively used by
others. By formulating the problem of aligning sampling top-$k$ ($SHR@k$) and
global top-$K$ ($HR@K$) Hit-Ratios through a mapping function $f$, so that
$SHR@k\approx HR@f(k)$, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally
that the sampling top-$k$ Hit-Ratio provides an accurate approximation of its
global (exact) counterpart, and can consistently predict the correct winners
(the same as indicate by their corresponding global Hit-Ratios).</span>

                                        <span>Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand
visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., &#x60;yeah&#x27; and &#x60;yes&#x27;). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as &#x60;I don&#x27;t know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG
state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won
the recent Visual Dialog 2020 challenge. Source code is available at

those additional emotions have not been used in previous emotion mining

algorithm and a Deep Learning model are both robust, measured by both Macro

medical specialists in vital circumstances. Deep learning methodologies
constitute a main approach for chest CT scan analysis and disease prediction.
However, large annotated databases are necessary for developing deep learning
models that are able to provide COVID-19 diagnosis across various medical
environments in different countries. Due to privacy issues, publicly available
COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders the research
and development of AI-enabled diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based on CT scans.
In this paper we present the COV19-CT-DB database which is annotated for
COVID-19, consisting of about 5,000 3-D CT scans, We have split the database in
training, validation and test datasets. The former two datasets can be used for
training and validation of machine learning models, while the latter will be
used for evaluation of the developed models. We also present a deep learning
approach, based on a CNN-RNN network and report its performance on the
COVID19-CT-DB database.</span>

to avoid obstacles, especially with developments in tires, suspensions,
steering, as well as safety technologies like ABS, ESC, and more recently, ADAS
systems. However, environments around passenger vehicles have also become more
complex, and dangerous. There have previously been studies that outline driver
tendencies and performance capabilities when attempting to avoid obstacles
while driving passenger vehicles. Now that autonomous vehicles are being
developed with obstacle avoidance capabilities, it is important to target
performance that meets or exceeds that of human drivers. This manuscript
highlights systems that are crucial for an emergency obstacle avoidance
maneuver (EOAM) and identifies the state-of-the-art for each of the related
systems, while considering the nuances of traveling at highway speeds. Some of
the primary EOAM-related systems/areas that are discussed in this review are:
general path planning methods, system hierarchies, decision-making, trajectory
generation, and trajectory-tracking control methods. After concluding remarks,
suggestions for future work which could lead to an ideal EOAM development, are
discussed.</span>

                                        <span>In the context of lossy compression, Blau &amp; Michaeli (2019) adopt a
mathematical notion of perceptual quality and define the information
rate-distortion-perception function, generalizing the classical rate-distortion
tradeoff. We consider the notion of universal representations in which one may
fix an encoder and vary the decoder to achieve any point within a collection of
distortion and perception constraints. We prove that the corresponding
information-theoretic universal rate-distortion-perception function is
operationally achievable in an approximate sense. Under MSE distortion, we show
that the entire distortion-perception tradeoff of a Gaussian source can be
achieved by a single encoder of the same rate asymptotically. We then
characterize the achievable distortion-perception region for a fixed
representation in the case of arbitrary distributions, identify conditions
under which the aforementioned results continue to hold approximately, and
study the case when the rate is not fixed in advance. This motivates the study
of practical constructions that are approximately universal across the RDP
tradeoff, thereby alleviating the need to design a new encoder for each
objective. We provide experimental results on MNIST and SVHN suggesting that on
image compression tasks, the operational tradeoffs achieved by machine learning
models with a fixed encoder suffer only a small penalty when compared to their
variable encoder counterparts.</span>

flexible representation of multiple types of interactions and relations between
entities. Similar to other graph-structured data, link prediction is one of the
most important tasks on multi-relational graphs and is often used for knowledge
completion. When related graphs coexist, it is of great benefit to build a
larger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires
predicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different
graphs (inter-domain link prediction). However, this poses a real challenge to
existing methods that are exclusively designed for link prediction between
entities of the same graph only (intra-domain link prediction). In this study,
we propose a new approach to tackle the inter-domain link prediction problem by
softly aligning the entity distributions between different domains with optimal
transport and maximum mean discrepancy regularizers. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that optimal transport regularizer is beneficial and considerably
improves the performance of baseline methods.</span>

                                        <span>Existing tensor completion formulation mostly relies on partial observations
from a single tensor. However, tensors extracted from real-world data are often
more complex due to: (i) Partial observation: Only a small subset (e.g., 5%) of
tensor elements are available. (ii) Coarse observation: Some tensor modes only
present coarse and aggregated patterns (e.g., monthly summary instead of daily
reports). In this paper, we are given a subset of the tensor and some
aggregated/coarse observations (along one or more modes) and seek to recover
the original fine-granular tensor with low-rank factorization. We formulate a
coupled tensor completion problem and propose an efficient Multi-resolution
Tensor Completion model (MTC) to solve the problem. Our MTC model explores
tensor mode properties and leverages the hierarchy of resolutions to
recursively initialize an optimization setup, and optimizes on the coupled
system using alternating least squares. MTC ensures low computational and space
complexity. We evaluate our model on two COVID-19 related spatio-temporal
tensors. The experiments show that MTC could provide 65.20% and 75.79%
percentage of fitness (PoF) in tensor completion with only 5% fine granular
observations, which is 27.96% relative improvement over the best baseline. To
evaluate the learned low-rank factors, we also design a tensor prediction task
for daily and cumulative disease case predictions, where MTC achieves 50% in
PoF and 30% relative improvements over the best baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Data programming (DP) has proven to be an attractive alternative to costly
hand-labeling of data.

In DP, users encode domain knowledge into \emph{labeling functions} (LF),
heuristics that label a subset of the data noisily and may have complex
dependencies. A label model is then fit to the LFs to produce an estimate of
the unknown class label.

The effects of label model misspecification on test set performance of a
downstream classifier are understudied. This presents a serious awareness gap
to practitioners, in particular since the dependency structure among LFs is
frequently ignored in field applications of DP.

We analyse modeling errors due to structure over-specification.

We derive novel theoretical bounds on the modeling error and empirically show
that this error can be substantial, even when modeling a seemingly sensible
structure.</span>

with hidden Markov models (HMMs) often playing a central role. Concurrently,
the rise of quantum technologies promises a host of advantages in computational
problems, typically in terms of the scaling of requisite resources such as time
and memory. HMMs are no exception to this, with recent results highlighting
quantum implementations of deterministic HMMs exhibiting superior memory and
thermal efficiency relative to their classical counterparts. In many contexts
however, non-deterministic HMMs are viable alternatives; compared to them the
advantages of current quantum implementations do not always hold. Here, we
provide a systematic prescription for constructing quantum implementations of
non-deterministic HMMs that re-establish the quantum advantages against this
broader class. Crucially, we show that whenever the classical implementation
suffers from thermal dissipation due to its need to process information in a
time-local manner, our quantum implementations will both mitigate some of this
dissipation, and achieve an advantage in memory compression.</span>

learning. So far, however, it is largely unclear why the learned
representations generalize so effectively to a large variety of downstream
tasks. We here prove that feedforward models trained with objectives belonging
to the commonly used InfoNCE family learn to implicitly invert the underlying
generative model of the observed data. While the proofs make certain
statistical assumptions about the generative model, we observe empirically that
our findings hold even if these assumptions are severely violated. Our theory
highlights a fundamental connection between contrastive learning, generative

                                        <span>We develop a variational framework to understand the properties of functions
learned by deep neural networks with ReLU activation functions fit to data. We
propose a new function space, which is reminiscent of classical bounded
variation spaces, that captures the compositional structure associated with
deep neural networks. We derive a representer theorem showing that deep ReLU
networks are solutions to regularized data fitting problems in this function
space. The function space consists of compositions of functions from the
(non-reflexive) Banach spaces of second-order bounded variation in the Radon
domain. These are Banach spaces with sparsity-promoting norms, giving insight
into the role of sparsity in deep neural networks. The neural network solutions
have skip connections and rank bounded weight matrices, providing new
theoretical support for these common architectural choices. The variational
problem we study can be recast as a finite-dimensional neural network training
problem with regularization schemes related to the notions of weight decay and
path-norm regularization. Finally, our analysis builds on techniques from
variational spline theory, providing new connections between deep neural
networks and splines.</span>

                                        <span>Security-sensitive applications that rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are
vulnerable to small perturbations that are crafted to generate Adversarial
Examples(AEs). The AEs are imperceptible to humans and cause DNN to misclassify
them. Many defense and detection techniques have been proposed. Model&#x27;s
confidences and Dropout, as a popular way to estimate the model&#x27;s uncertainty,
have been used for AE detection but they showed limited success against black-
and gray-box attacks. Moreover, the state-of-the-art detection techniques have
been designed for specific attacks or broken by others, need knowledge about
the attacks, are not consistent, increase model parameters overhead, are
time-consuming, or have latency in inference time. To trade off these factors,
we revisit the model&#x27;s uncertainty and confidences and propose a novel
unsupervised ensemble AE detection mechanism that 1) uses the uncertainty
method called SelectiveNet, 2) processes model layers outputs, i.e.feature
maps, to generate new confidence probabilities. The detection method is called
Selective and Feature based Adversarial Detection (SFAD). Experimental results
show that the proposed approach achieves better performance against black- and
gray-box attacks than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable
performance against white-box attacks. Moreover, results show that SFAD is
fully robust against High Confidence Attacks (HCAs) for MNIST and partially
robust for CIFAR10 datasets.</span>

are luminous centers of galaxies where a black hole feeds on surrounding
matter. The variability patterns of the light emitted by an AGN contain
information about the physical properties of the underlying black hole.
Upcoming telescopes will observe over 100 million AGN in multiple broadband
wavelengths, yielding a large sample of multivariate time series with long gaps
and irregular sampling. We present a method that reconstructs the AGN time
series and simultaneously infers the posterior probability density distribution
(PDF) over the physical quantities of the black hole, including its mass and
luminosity. We apply this method to a simulated dataset of 11,000 AGN and
report precision and accuracy of 0.4 dex and 0.3 dex in the inferred black hole
mass. This work is the first to address probabilistic time series
reconstruction and parameter inference for AGN in an end-to-end fashion.</span>

                                        <span>The recently proposed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based accountant for
evaluating $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees using the
privacy loss distribution formalism has been shown to give tighter bounds than
commonly used methods such as R\&#x27;enyi accountants when applied to homogeneous
compositions, i.e., to compositions of identical mechanisms. In this paper, we
extend this approach to heterogeneous compositions. We carry out a full error
analysis that allows choosing the parameters of the algorithm such that a
desired accuracy is obtained. The analysis also extends previous results by
taking into account all the parameters of the algorithm. Using the error
analysis, we also give a bound for the computational complexity in terms of the
error which is analogous to and slightly tightens the one given by Murtagh and
Vadhan (2018). We also show how to speed up the evaluation of tight privacy
guarantees using the Plancherel theorem at the cost of increased
pre-computation and memory usage.</span>

limited accuracy costs, by replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple
linear transformations that &quot;mix&quot; input tokens. These linear transformations,
along with standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at
modeling semantic relationships in several text classification tasks. Most
surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a
Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves
92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains
nearly seven times faster on GPUs and twice as fast on TPUs. The resulting
model, FNet, also scales very efficiently to long inputs. Specifically, when
compared to the &quot;efficient&quot; Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark,
FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, but is faster than the
fastest models across all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively
shorter lengths on TPUs). Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint and is
particularly efficient at smaller model sizes: for a fixed speed and accuracy
budget, small FNet models outperform Transformer counterparts.</span>

use topological data analysis of the loss function and its Morse complex to
relate local behavior along gradient trajectories with global properties of the
loss surface. We define neural network Topological Obstructions score,
TO-score, with help of robust topological invariants, barcodes of loss
function, that quantify the badness of local minima for gradient-based
optimization. We have made several experiments for computing these invariants,
for small neural networks, and for fully connected, convolutional and

complex, dynamic environments. Adaptive control laws can endow even nonlinear
systems with good trajectory tracking performance, provided that any uncertain
dynamics terms are linearly parameterizable with known nonlinear features.
However, it is often difficult to specify such features a priori, such as for
aerodynamic disturbances on rotorcraft or interaction forces between a
manipulator arm and various objects. In this paper, we turn to data-driven
modeling with neural networks to learn, offline from past data, an adaptive
controller with an internal parametric model of these nonlinear features. Our
key insight is that we can better prepare the controller for deployment with
control-oriented meta-learning of features in closed-loop simulation, rather
than regression-oriented meta-learning of features to fit input-output data.
Specifically, we meta-learn the adaptive controller with closed-loop tracking
simulation as the base-learner and the average tracking error as the
meta-objective. With a nonlinear planar rotorcraft subject to wind, we
demonstrate that our adaptive controller outperforms other controllers trained
with regression-oriented meta-learning when deployed in closed-loop for
trajectory tracking control.</span>

common supervision techniques may be affected by the poor quality of the
available labels : in actual operational use-cases, these labels may be weak in
quantity, quality or trustworthiness. We propose a benchmark to evaluate the
natural robustness of different algorithms taken from various paradigms on
artificially corrupted datasets, with a focus on noisy labels. This paper
studies the intrinsic robustness of some leading classifiers. The algorithms

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are widespread due to their powerful performance. Yet,
they suffer from degraded performance in the presence of noisy labels at train
time or adversarial examples during inference. Inspired by the setting of
learning with expert advice, where multiplicative weights (MW) updates were
recently shown to be robust to moderate adversarial corruptions, we propose to
use MW for reweighting examples during neural networks optimization. We
establish the convergence of our method when used with gradient descent and
show its advantage in two simple examples. We then validate empirically our
findings by demonstrating that MW improve networks accuracy in the presence of
label noise on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M, and leads to better
robustness to adversarial attacks.</span>

Vision Transformer with the fewest possible modifications as well as inductive

Transformer layers to propagate information across longer distances. To provide

escape from predators. We consider a model of two competing microswimmers
engaged in a pursue-evasion task while immersed in a low-Reynolds-number
environment. The players have limited abilities: they can only sense
hydrodynamic disturbances, which provide some cue about the opponent&#x27;s
position, and perform simple manoeuvres. The goal of the pursuer is to
capturethe evader in the shortest possible time. Conversely the evader aims at
deferring capture as much as possible. We show that by means of Reinforcement
Learning the players find efficient and physically explainable strategies which
non-trivially exploit the hydrodynamic environment. This Letter offers a
proof-of-concept for the use of Reinforcement Learning to discover
prey-predator strategies in aquatic environments, with potential applications

                                        <span>Action-value estimation is a critical component of many reinforcement
learning (RL) methods whereby sample complexity relies heavily on how fast a
good estimator for action value can be learned. By viewing this problem through
the lens of representation learning, good representations of both state and
action can facilitate action-value estimation. While advances in deep learning
have seamlessly driven progress in learning state representations, given the
specificity of the notion of agency to RL, little attention has been paid to
learning action representations. We conjecture that leveraging the
combinatorial structure of multi-dimensional action spaces is a key ingredient
for learning good representations of action. To test this, we set forth the
action hypergraph networks framework -- a class of functions for learning
action representations in multi-dimensional discrete action spaces with a
structural inductive bias. Using this framework we realise an agent class based
on a combination with deep Q-networks, which we dub hypergraph Q-networks. We
show the effectiveness of our approach on a myriad of domains: illustrative
prediction problems under minimal confounding effects, Atari 2600 games, and
discretised physical control benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, considerable literature has grown up around the theme of few-shot
named entity recognition (NER), but little published benchmark data
specifically focused on the practical and challenging task. Current approaches
collect existing supervised NER datasets and re-organize them to the few-shot
setting for empirical study. These strategies conventionally aim to recognize
coarse-grained entity types with few examples, while in practice, most unseen
entity types are fine-grained. In this paper, we present Few-NERD, a
large-scale human-annotated few-shot NER dataset with a hierarchy of 8
coarse-grained and 66 fine-grained entity types. Few-NERD consists of 188,238
sentences from Wikipedia, 4,601,160 words are included and each is annotated as
context or a part of a two-level entity type. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first few-shot NER dataset and the largest human-crafted NER
dataset. We construct benchmark tasks with different emphases to
comprehensively assess the generalization capability of models. Extensive
empirical results and analysis show that Few-NERD is challenging and the
problem requires further research. We make Few-NERD public at

                                        <span>The phenomenon of adversarial examples illustrates one of the most basic
vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. Among the variety of techniques
introduced to surmount this inherent weakness, adversarial training has emerged
as the most common and efficient strategy to achieve robustness. Typically,
this is achieved by balancing robust and natural objectives. In this work, we
aim to achieve better trade-off between robust and natural performances by
enforcing a domain-invariant feature representation. We present a new
adversarial training method, Domain Invariant Adversarial Learning (DIAL),
which learns a feature representation which is both robust and domain
invariant. DIAL uses a variant of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) on
the natural domain and its corresponding adversarial domain. In a case where
the source domain consists of natural examples and the target domain is the
adversarially perturbed examples, our method learns a feature representation
constrained not to discriminate between the natural and adversarial examples,
and can therefore achieve a more robust representation. Our experiments
indicate that our method improves both robustness and natural accuracy, when
compared to current state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.</span>

its theoretical foundations, mostly for (nonlinear) deep neural networks (DNNs)
that are probably the most prominent machine learning models for large-scale
data in the community over the past decade. We generalize the formulation of
classification margins from classical research to latest DNNs, summarize
theoretical connections between the margin, network generalization, and
robustness, and introduce recent efforts in enlarging the margins for DNNs
comprehensively. Since the viewpoint of different methods is discrepant, we
categorize them into groups for ease of comparison and discussion in the paper.
Hopefully, our discussions and overview inspire new research work in the
community that aim to improve the performance of DNNs, and we also point to
directions where the large margin principle can be verified to provide
theoretical evidence why certain regularizations for DNNs function well in
practice. We managed to shorten the paper such that the crucial spirit of large

                                        <span>Contrastive loss and its variants have become very popular recently for
learning visual representations without supervision. In this work, we study
three intriguing properties of contrastive learning. We first generalize the
standard contrastive loss to a broader family of losses, and we find that
various instantiations of the generalized loss perform similarly under the
presence of a multi-layer non-linear projection head. We then study if
instance-based contrastive learning (such as in SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, and so on,
which are based on global image representation) can learn well on images with
multiple objects present. We find that meaningful hierarchical local features
can be learned despite the fact that these objectives operate on global
instance-level features.

Finally, we study an intriguing phenomenon of feature suppression among
competing features shared across augmented views, such as &quot;color distribution&quot;
vs &quot;object class&quot;. We construct datasets with explicit and controllable
competing features, and show that, for contrastive learning, a few bits of
easy-to-learn shared features can suppress, and even fully prevent, the
learning of other sets of competing features. In scenarios where there are
multiple objects in an image, the dominant object would suppress the learning
of smaller objects. Existing contrastive learning methods critically rely on
data augmentation to favor certain sets of features over others, and face
potential limitation for scenarios where existing augmentations cannot fully
address the feature suppression. This poses open challenges to existing
contrastive learning techniques.</span>

                                        <span>The intuition that local flatness of the loss landscape is correlated with
better generalization for deep neural networks (DNNs) has been explored for
decades, spawning many different flatness measures. Recently, this link with
generalization has been called into question by a demonstration that many
measures of flatness are vulnerable to parameter re-scaling which arbitrarily
changes their value without changing neural network outputs.

Here we show that, in addition, some popular variants of SGD such as Adam and
Entropy-SGD, can also break the flatness-generalization correlation. As an
alternative to flatness measures, we use a function based picture and propose
using the log of Bayesian prior upon initialization, $\log P(f)$, as a
predictor of the generalization when a DNN converges on function $f$ after
training to zero error. The prior is directly proportional to the Bayesian
posterior for functions that give zero error on a test set. For the case of
image classification, we show that $\log P(f)$ is a significantly more robust
predictor of generalization than flatness measures are.

Whilst local flatness measures fail under parameter re-scaling, the
prior/posterior, which is global quantity, remains invariant under re-scaling.
Moreover, the correlation with generalization as a function of data complexity
remains good for different variants of SGD.</span>

experience, reveal data errors, and provide deeper insight into the data.
Inference query explanation seeks to explain unexpected aggregate query results
on inference data; such queries are challenging to explain because an
explanation may need to be derived from the source, training, or inference data
in an ML pipeline. In this paper, we model an objective function as a black-box
function and propose BOExplain, a novel framework for explaining inference
queries using Bayesian optimization (BO). An explanation is a predicate
defining the input tuples that should be removed so that the query result of
interest is significantly affected. BO - a technique for finding the global
optimum of a black-box function - is used to find the best predicate. We
develop two new techniques (individual contribution encoding and warm start) to
handle categorical variables. We perform experiments showing that the
predicates found by BOExplain have a higher degree of explanation compared to
those found by the state-of-the-art query explanation engines. We also show
that BOExplain is effective at deriving explanations for inference queries from
source and training data on a variety of real-world datasets. BOExplain is
open-sourced as a Python package at https://github.com/sfu-db/BOExplain.</span>

                                        <span>The rise of algorithmic decision-making has spawned much research on fair
machine learning (ML). Financial institutions use ML for building risk
scorecards that support a range of credit-related decisions. Yet, the
literature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three
contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine
their adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for
incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we
empirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit
scoring context using real-world data. The empirical results substantiate the
evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair
credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions.
We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once
and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a
scorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between
profit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to
a reasonable level at a relatively low cost. The codes corresponding to the

                                        <span>Recently, sound-based COVID-19 detection studies have shown great promise to
achieve scalable and prompt digital pre-screening. However, there are still two
unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model
training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users
tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features.
Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions.
Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the
uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an
ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19
detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data.
As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling
and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a
specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from
the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions
often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty
higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take
clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a
more robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system.</span>

Smilkov et al., 2017] that provide instance-specific explanations of model
predictions are often based on assumption (A): magnitude of input gradients --
gradients of logits with respect to input -- noisily highlight discriminative
task-relevant features. In this work, we test the validity of assumption (A)
using a three-pronged approach. First, we develop an evaluation framework,
DiffROAR, to test assumption (A) on four image classification benchmarks. Our
results suggest that (i) input gradients of standard models (i.e., trained on
original data) may grossly violate (A), whereas (ii) input gradients of
adversarially robust models satisfy (A). Second, we then introduce BlockMNIST,
an MNIST-based semi-real dataset, that by design encodes a priori knowledge of
discriminative features. Our analysis on BlockMNIST leverages this information
to validate as well as characterize differences between input gradient
attributions of standard and robust models. Finally, we theoretically prove
that our empirical findings hold on a simplified version of the BlockMNIST
dataset. Specifically, we prove that input gradients of standard
one-hidden-layer MLPs trained on this dataset do not highlight
instance-specific signal coordinates, thus grossly violating assumption (A).
Our findings motivate the need to formalize and test common assumptions in
interpretability in a falsifiable manner [Leavitt and Morcos, 2020].
Additionally, we believe that the DiffROAR evaluation framework and
BlockMNIST-based datasets can serve as sanity checks to audit instance-specific
interpretability methods.</span>

learning (RL) agents in vision-based environments. This poses many challenges,
such as high dimensionality and potential for observational overfitting through
spurious correlations. A promising approach to solve both of these problems is
a self-attention bottleneck, which provides a simple and effective framework
for learning high performing policies, even in the presence of distractions.
However, due to poor scalability of attention architectures, these methods do
not scale beyond low resolution visual inputs, using large patches (thus small
attention matrices). In this paper we make use of new efficient attention
algorithms, recently shown to be highly effective for Transformers, and
demonstrate that these new techniques can be applied in the RL setting. This
allows our attention-based controllers to scale to larger visual inputs, and
facilitate the use of smaller patches, even individual pixels, improving
generalization. In addition, we propose a new efficient algorithm approximating
softmax attention with what we call hybrid random features, leveraging the
theory of angular kernels. We show theoretically and empirically that hybrid
random features is a promising approach when using attention for vision-based
RL.</span>

often bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep
hierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by
capturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end
optimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that
greedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously
address both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of
large-scale video prediction. We introduce Greedy Hierarchical Variational
Autoencoders (GHVAEs), a method that learns high-fidelity video predictions by
greedily training each level of a hierarchical autoencoder. In comparison to
state-of-the-art models, GHVAEs provide 17-55% gains in prediction performance
on four video datasets, a 35-40% higher success rate on real robot tasks, and
can improve performance monotonically by simply adding more modules.</span>

significant development in recent years. However, one outstanding challenge is
to build a coherent statistical inference procedure on persistent diagrams. The
paired dependent data structure, which are the births and deaths in persistent
diagrams, adds complexity to statistical inference. In this paper, we present a
new lattice path representation for persistent diagrams. A new exact
statistical inference procedure is developed for lattice paths via
combinatorial enumerations. The proposed lattice path method is applied to
study the topological characterization of the protein structures of the
COVID-19 virus. We demonstrate that there are topological changes during the
conformational change of spike proteins, a necessary step in infecting host

                                        <span>Despite the accomplishments of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in
modeling data distributions, training them remains a challenging task. A
contributing factor to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN
loss curves, which necessitates a subjective evaluation of the generated output
to infer training progress. Recently, motivated by game theory, duality gap has
been proposed as a domain agnostic measure to monitor GAN training. However, it
is restricted to the setting when the GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium. But
GANs need not always converge to a Nash equilibrium to model the data
distribution. In this work, we extend the notion of duality gap to proximal
duality gap that is applicable to the general context of training GANs where
Nash equilibria may not exist. We show theoretically that the proximal duality
gap is capable of monitoring the convergence of GANs to a wider spectrum of
equilibria that subsumes Nash equilibria. We also theoretically establish the
relationship between the proximal duality gap and the divergence between the
real and generated data distributions for different GAN formulations. Our
results provide new insights into the nature of GAN convergence. Finally, we
validate experimentally the usefulness of proximal duality gap for monitoring
and influencing GAN training.</span>

                                        <span>Given the increasing importance of machine learning (ML) in our lives,
several algorithmic fairness techniques have been proposed to mitigate biases
in the outcomes of the ML models. However, most of these techniques are
specialized to cater to a single family of ML models and a specific definition
of fairness, limiting their adaptibility in practice. We introduce a general
constrained Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to optimize the performance of
any ML model while enforcing one or multiple fairness constraints. BO is a
model-agnostic optimization method that has been successfully applied to
automatically tune the hyperparameters of ML models. We apply BO with fairness
constraints to a range of popular models, including random forests, gradient
boosting, and neural networks, showing that we can obtain accurate and fair
solutions by acting solely on the hyperparameters. We also show empirically
that our approach is competitive with specialized techniques that enforce
model-specific fairness constraints, and outperforms preprocessing methods that
learn fair representations of the input data. Moreover, our method can be used
in synergy with such specialized fairness techniques to tune their
hyperparameters. Finally, we study the relationship between fairness and the
hyperparameters selected by BO. We observe a correlation between regularization
and unbiased models, explaining why acting on the hyperparameters leads to ML
models that generalize well and are fair.</span>

                                        <span>Fact-based Visual Question Answering (FVQA), a challenging variant of VQA,
requires a QA-system to include facts from a diverse knowledge graph (KG) in
its reasoning process to produce an answer. Large KGs, especially common-sense
KGs, are known to be incomplete, i.e., not all non-existent facts are always
incorrect. Therefore, being able to reason over incomplete KGs for QA is a
critical requirement in real-world applications that has not been addressed
extensively in the literature. We develop a novel QA architecture that allows
us to reason over incomplete KGs, something current FVQA state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches lack due to their critical reliance on fact retrieval. We use
KG Embeddings, a technique widely used for KG completion, for the downstream
task of FVQA. We also employ a new image representation technique we call
&#x27;Image-as-Knowledge&#x27; to enable this capability, alongside a simple one-step
CoAttention mechanism to attend to text and image during QA. Our FVQA
architecture is faster during inference time, being O(m), as opposed to
existing FVQA SOTA methods which are O(N log N), where m &#x3D; number of vertices,
N &#x3D; number of edges &#x3D; O(m^2). KG embeddings are shown to hold complementary
information to word embeddings: a combination of both metrics permits
performance comparable to SOTA methods in the standard answer retrieval task,
and significantly better (26% absolute) in the proposed missing-edge reasoning
task.</span>

sample-efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, efficient
exploration in high-dimensional observation spaces still remains a challenge.
This paper presents Random Encoders for Efficient Exploration (RE3), an
exploration method that utilizes state entropy as an intrinsic reward. In order
to estimate state entropy in environments with high-dimensional observations,
we utilize a k-nearest neighbor entropy estimator in the low-dimensional
representation space of a convolutional encoder. In particular, we find that
the state entropy can be estimated in a stable and compute-efficient manner by
utilizing a randomly initialized encoder, which is fixed throughout training.
Our experiments show that RE3 significantly improves the sample-efficiency of
both model-free and model-based RL methods on locomotion and navigation tasks
from DeepMind Control Suite and MiniGrid benchmarks. We also show that RE3
allows learning diverse behaviors without extrinsic rewards, effectively
improving sample-efficiency in downstream tasks. Source code and videos are

training objectives typically operates in a regime we call the Edge of
Stability. In this regime, the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian
hovers just above the numerical value $2 / \text{(step size)}$, and the
training loss behaves non-monotonically over short timescales, yet consistently
decreases over long timescales. Since this behavior is inconsistent with
several widespread presumptions in the field of optimization, our findings
raise questions as to whether these presumptions are relevant to neural network
training. We hope that our findings will inspire future efforts aimed at

model&#x27;s prediction back to the original input space. These &quot;visual&quot;
explanations are often insufficient, as the model&#x27;s actual concept remains
elusive. Moreover, without insights into the model&#x27;s semantic concept, it is
difficult -- if not impossible -- to intervene on the model&#x27;s behavior via its
explanations, called Explanatory Interactive Learning. Consequently, we propose
to intervene on a Neuro-Symbolic scene representation, which allows one to
revise the model on the semantic level, e.g. &quot;never focus on the color to make
your decision&quot;. We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the
CLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The
results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic
explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can
identify confounders that are not identifiable using &quot;visual&quot; explanations
only. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to
revise the model from focusing on these factors.</span>

                                        <span>We study defense strategies against reward poisoning attacks in reinforcement
learning. As a threat model, we consider attacks that minimally alter rewards
to make the attacker&#x27;s target policy uniquely optimal under the poisoned
rewards, with the optimality gap specified by an attack parameter. Our goal is
to design agents that are robust against such attacks in terms of the
worst-case utility w.r.t. the true, unpoisoned, rewards while computing their
policies under the poisoned rewards. We propose an optimization framework for
deriving optimal defense policies, both when the attack parameter is known and
unknown. Moreover, we show that defense policies that are solutions to the
proposed optimization problems have provable performance guarantees. In
particular, we provide the following bounds with respect to the true,
unpoisoned, rewards: a) lower bounds on the expected return of the defense
policies, and b) upper bounds on how suboptimal these defense policies are
compared to the attacker&#x27;s target policy. We conclude the paper by illustrating
the intuitions behind our formal results, and showing that the derived bounds
are non-trivial.</span>

                                        <span>Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand
visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., &#x60;yeah&#x27; and &#x60;yes&#x27;). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as &#x60;I don&#x27;t know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG
state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won
the recent Visual Dialog 2020 challenge. Source code is available at

                                        <span>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques can benefit greatly from
leveraging prior experience, which can be either self-generated or acquired
from other entities. Action advising is a framework that provides a flexible
way to transfer such knowledge in the form of actions between teacher-student
peers. However, due to the realistic concerns, the number of these interactions
is limited with a budget; therefore, it is crucial to perform these in the most
appropriate moments. There have been several promising studies recently that
address this problem setting especially from the student&#x27;s perspective. Despite
their success, they have some shortcomings when it comes to the practical
applicability and integrity as an overall solution to the learning from advice
challenge. In this paper, we extend the idea of advice reusing via teacher
imitation to construct a unified approach that addresses both advice collection
and advice utilisation problems. We also propose a method to automatically tune
the relevant hyperparameters of these components on-the-fly to make it able to
adapt to any task with minimal human intervention. The experiments we performed
in $5$ different Atari games verify that our algorithm either surpasses or
performs on-par with its top competitors while being far simpler to be
employed. Furthermore, its individual components are also found to be providing
significant advantages alone.</span>

support the role of attention-based explanations as a faithful and plausible

of algorithmic approaches and software. This paper introduces infrastructure
and methodologies for text classifiers based on large-scale regular
expressions. In particular, we describe how Facebook determines if a given
piece of text - anything from a hashtag to a post - belongs to a narrow topic
such as COVID-19. To fully define a topic and evaluate classifier performance
we employ human-guided iterations of keyword discovery, but do not require
labeled data. For COVID-19, we build two sets of regular expressions: (1) for
66 languages, with 99% precision and recall &gt;50%, (2) for the 11 most common
languages, with precision &gt;90% and recall &gt;90%. Regular expressions enable
low-latency queries from multiple platforms. Response to challenges like
COVID-19 is fast and so are revisions. Comparisons to a DNN classifier show
explainable results, higher precision and recall, and less overfitting. Our
learnings can be applied to other narrow-topic classifiers.</span>

networks and have achieved many promising results. However, on the more
challenging binary neural networks (BNNs), this task has not yet been fully
explored in the community. In this paper, we focus on this more difficult
scenario: learning networks where both weights and activations are binary,
meanwhile, without any human annotated labels. We observe that the commonly
used contrastive objective is not satisfying on BNNs for competitive accuracy,
since the backbone network contains relatively limited capacity and
representation ability. Hence instead of directly applying existing
self-supervised methods, which cause a severe decline in performance, we
present a novel guided learning paradigm from real-valued to distill binary
networks on the final prediction distribution, to minimize the loss and obtain
desirable accuracy. Our proposed method can boost the simple contrastive
learning baseline by an absolute gain of 5.5~15% on BNNs. We further reveal
that it is difficult for BNNs to recover the similar predictive distributions
as real-valued models when training without labels. Thus, how to calibrate them
is key to address the degradation in performance. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the large-scale ImageNet and downstream datasets. Our method
achieves substantial improvement over the simple contrastive learning baseline,
and is even comparable to many mainstream supervised BNN methods. Code is

                                        <span>Deep neural networks that yield human interpretable decisions by
architectural design have lately become an increasingly popular alternative to
post hoc interpretation of traditional black-box models. Among these networks,
the arguably most widespread approach is so-called prototype learning, where
similarities to learned latent prototypes serve as the basis of classifying an
unseen data point. In this work, we point to an important shortcoming of such
approaches. Namely, there is a semantic gap between similarity in latent space
and similarity in input space, which can corrupt interpretability. We design
two experiments that exemplify this issue on the so-called ProtoPNet.
Specifically, we find that this network&#x27;s interpretability mechanism can be led
astray by intentionally crafted or even JPEG compression artefacts, which can
produce incomprehensible decisions. We argue that practitioners ought to have
this shortcoming in mind when deploying prototype-based models in practice.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of identifying the best arm in a stochastic multi-armed
bandit game. Given a set of $n$ arms indexed from $1$ to $n$, each arm $i$ is
associated with an unknown reward distribution supported on $[0,1]$ with mean
$\theta_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$. Assume $\theta_1 &gt; \theta_2 \geq \cdots
\geq\theta_n$. We propose an adaptive algorithm which explores the gaps and
variances of the rewards of the arms and makes future decisions based on the
gathered information using a novel approach called \textit{grouped median
elimination}. The proposed algorithm guarantees to output the best arm with
probability $(1-\delta)$ and uses at most $O \left(\sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^n
\left(\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\right)(\ln \delta^{-1}
+ \ln \ln \Delta_i^{-1})\right)$ samples, where $\Delta_i$ ($i \geq 2$) denotes
the reward gap between arm $i$ and the best arm and we define $\Delta_1 &#x3D;
\Delta_2$. This achieves a significant advantage over the variance-independent
algorithms in some favorable scenarios and is the first result that removes the
extra $\ln n$ factor on the best arm compared with the state-of-the-art. We
further show that $\Omega \left( \sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^n \left(
\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i} \right) \ln \delta^{-1}
\right)$ samples are necessary for an algorithm to achieve the same goal,
thereby illustrating that our algorithm is optimal up to doubly logarithmic
terms.</span>

networks (DNNs) set the bar for algorithm performance. However, depending upon
additional constraints such as processing power and execution time limits, or
requirements such as verifiable safety guarantees, it may not be feasible to
actually use such high-performing DNNs in practice. Many techniques have been
developed in recent years to compress or distill complex DNNs into smaller,
faster or more understandable models and controllers. This work seeks to
identify reduced models that not only preserve a desired performance level, but
also, for example, succinctly explain the latent knowledge represented by a
DNN. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the evaluation
of decision tree variants and kernel machines in the context of benchmark
reinforcement learning tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Recent years have seen the introduction of a range of methods for post-hoc
explainability of image classifier predictions. However, these post-hoc
explanations may not always align perfectly with classifier predictions, which
poses a significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such
explanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve alignment
between model predictions and explanation method that is both agnostic to the
model and explanation classes and which does not require ground truth
explanations. We achieve this through a novel explanation-driven data
augmentation (EDDA) method that augments the training data with occlusions of
existing data stemming from model-explanations; this is based on the simple
motivating principle that occluding salient regions for the model prediction
should decrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding
non-salient regions should not change the prediction -- if the model and
explainer are aligned. To verify that this augmentation method improves model
and explainer alignment, we evaluate the methodology on a variety of datasets,
image classification models, and explanation methods. We verify in all cases
that our explanation-driven data augmentation method improves alignment of the
model and explanation in comparison to no data augmentation and non-explanation
driven data augmentation methods. In conclusion, this approach provides a novel
model- and explainer-agnostic methodology for improving alignment between model
predictions and explanations, which we see as a critical step forward for
practical deployment and debugging of image classification models.</span>

                                        <span>One of the main challenges in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is to
decide which aspects of the environment should be modeled. The
value-equivalence (VE) principle proposes a simple answer to this question: a
model should capture the aspects of the environment that are relevant for
value-based planning. Technically, VE distinguishes models based on a set of
policies and a set of functions: a model is said to be VE to the environment if
the Bellman operators it induces for the policies yield the correct result when
applied to the functions. As the number of policies and functions increase, the
set of VE models shrinks, eventually collapsing to a single point corresponding
to a perfect model. A fundamental question underlying the VE principle is thus
how to select the smallest sets of policies and functions that are sufficient
for planning. In this paper we take an important step towards answering this
question. We start by generalizing the concept of VE to order-$k$ counterparts
defined with respect to $k$ applications of the Bellman operator. This leads to
a family of VE classes that increase in size as $k \rightarrow \infty$. In the
limit, all functions become value functions, and we have a special
instantiation of VE which we call proper VE or simply PVE. Unlike VE, the PVE
class may contain multiple models even in the limit when all value functions
are used. Crucially, all these models are sufficient for planning, meaning that
they will yield an optimal policy despite the fact that they may ignore many
aspects of the environment. We construct a loss function for learning PVE
models and argue that popular algorithms such as MuZero and Muesli can be
understood as minimizing an upper bound for this loss. We leverage this
connection to propose a modification to MuZero and show that it can lead to
improved performance in practice.</span>

by efficiently navigating a physically constrained domain. The framework is
examined on the task of generating molecules that are designed to bind,
noncovalently, to functional sites of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We present a spatial
Graph Attention Network (sGAT) that leverages self-attention over both node and

considerable interest in areas such as molecular and synthetic biology and drug
discovery. An attentional policy network is then introduced to learn decision
rules for a dynamic, fragment-based chemical environment, and state-of-the-art
policy gradient techniques are employed to train the network with enhanced
stability. Exploration is efficiently encouraged by incorporating innovation
reward bonuses learned and proposed by random network distillation. In

                                        <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted lives and economies across the globe,
leading to many deaths. While vaccination is an important intervention, its
roll-out is slow and unequal across the globe. Therefore, extensive testing
still remains one of the key methods to monitor and contain the virus. Testing
on a large scale is expensive and arduous. Hence, we need alternate methods to
estimate the number of cases. Online surveys have been shown to be an effective
method for data collection amidst the pandemic. In this work, we develop
machine learning models to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 using
self-reported symptoms. Our best model predicts the daily cases with a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 226.30 (normalized MAE of 27.09%) per state, which
demonstrates the possibility of predicting the actual number of confirmed cases
by utilizing self-reported symptoms. The models are developed at two levels of
data granularity - local models, which are trained at the state level, and a
single global model which is trained on the combined data aggregated across all
states. Our results indicate a lower error on the local models as opposed to
the global model. In addition, we also show that the most important symptoms
(features) vary considerably from state to state. This work demonstrates that
the models developed on crowd-sourced data, curated via online platforms, can
complement the existing epidemiological surveillance infrastructure in a
cost-effective manner. The code is publicly available at

                                        <span>Order dispatch is one of the central problems to ride-sharing platforms.
Recently, value-based reinforcement learning algorithms have shown promising
performance on this problem. However, in real-world applications, the
non-stationarity of the demand-supply system poses challenges to re-utilizing
data generated in different time periods to learn the value function. In this
work, motivated by the fact that the relative relationship between the values
of some states is largely stable across various environments, we propose a
pattern transfer learning framework for value-based reinforcement learning in
the order dispatch problem. Our method efficiently captures the value patterns
by incorporating a concordance penalty. The superior performance of the
proposed method is supported by experiments.</span>

                                        <span>This paper is dedicated to designing provably efficient adversarial imitation
learning (AIL) algorithms that directly optimize policies from expert
demonstrations. Firstly, we develop a transition-aware AIL algorithm named TAIL
with an expert sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(H^{3/2} |S|/\varepsilon)$ under
the known transition setting, where $H$ is the planning horizon, $|S|$ is the
state space size and $\varepsilon$ is desired policy value gap. This improves
upon the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(H^2 |S| / \varepsilon^2)$ for AIL
methods and matches the lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega} (H^{3/2}
|S|/\varepsilon)$ in [Rajaraman et al., 2021] up to a logarithmic factor. The
key ingredient of TAIL is a fine-grained estimator for expert state-action
distribution, which explicitly utilizes the transition function information.
Secondly, considering practical settings where the transition functions are
usually unknown but environment interaction is allowed, we accordingly develop
a model-based transition-aware AIL algorithm named MB-TAIL. In particular,
MB-TAIL builds an empirical transition model by interacting with the
environment and performs imitation under the recovered empirical model. The
interaction complexity of MB-TAIL is $\tilde{O} (H^3 |S|^2 |A| /
\varepsilon^2)$, which improves the best known result of $\tilde{O} (H^4 |S|^2
|A| / \varepsilon^2)$ in [Shani et al., 2021]. Finally, our theoretical results
are supported by numerical evaluation and detailed analysis on two challenging
MDPs.</span>

immediate impact on crowdfunding is nonetheless significant. This study takes a
computational approach to more deeply comprehend this change. Using a unique
data set of all the campaigns published over the past two years on GoFundMe, we
explore the factors that have led to the successful funding of a crowdfunding
project. In particular, we study a corpus of crowdfunded projects, analyzing
cover images and other variables commonly present on crowdfunding sites.
Furthermore, we construct a classifier and a regression model to assess the
significance of features based on XGBoost. In addition, we employ
counterfactual analysis to investigate the causality between features and the
success of crowdfunding. More importantly, sentiment analysis and the paired
sample t-test are performed to examine the differences in crowdfunding
campaigns before and after the COVID-19 outbreak that started in March 2020.
First, we note that there is significant racial disparity in crowdfunding
success. Second, we find that sad emotion expressed through the campaign&#x27;s
description became significant after the COVID-19 outbreak. Considering all
these factors, our findings shed light on the impact of COVID-19 on
crowdfunding campaigns.</span>

estimated by the Polyak-Ruppert averaging procedure of stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) algorithms. We leverage insights from time series regression in
econometrics and construct asymptotically pivotal statistics via random
scaling. Our approach is fully operational with online data and is rigorously
underpinned by a functional central limit theorem. Our proposed inference
method has a couple of key advantages over the existing methods. First, the
test statistic is computed in an online fashion with only SGD iterates and the
critical values can be obtained without any resampling methods, thereby
allowing for efficient implementation suitable for massive online data. Second,
there is no need to estimate the asymptotic variance and our inference method
is shown to be robust to changes in the tuning parameters for SGD algorithms in

                                        <span>It is crucial for policymakers to understand the community prevalence of
COVID-19 so combative resources can be effectively allocated and prioritized
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditionally, community prevalence has been
assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However, despite the
increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been
met in most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method
for communities to determine disease prevalence. This is further complicated by
the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and spread varies across different
spatial, temporal, and demographics. In this study, we understand trends in the
spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms
surveys as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess
community disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability.
Using individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method
predicts the likely percentage of the population that tested positive for
COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative
Error (MRE) of 60.40\% with 95\% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67). This
implies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases than the original in a
population of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage
of the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported
symptoms data from previous days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15
(MRE of 23.61\% with 95\% confidence interval as (23.6, 13.7)) for New York. We
present an analysis of these results, exposing various clinical attributes of
interest across different demographics. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze how
various policy enactments (testing, curfew) affect the prevalence of COVID-19
in a community.</span>

functionally separate, yet they often use the same network architectures. This
case study explores the performance impact of network sizes when considering
actor and critic architectures independently. By relaxing the assumption of
architectural symmetry, it is often possible for smaller actors to achieve
comparable policy performance to their symmetric counterparts. Our experiments
show up to 99% reduction in the number of network weights with an average
reduction of 77% over multiple actor-critic algorithms on 9 independent tasks.
Given that reducing actor complexity results in a direct reduction of run-time
inference cost, we believe configurations of actors and critics are aspects of
actor-critic design that deserve to be considered independently, particularly
in resource-constrained applications or when deploying multiple actors
simultaneously.</span>

extract and compare the structure of datasets. TDA identifies features in data
such as connected components and holes and assigns a quantitative measure to
these features. Several studies reported that topological features extracted by
TDA tools provide unique information about the data, discover new insights, and
determine which feature is more related to the outcome. On the other hand, the
overwhelming success of deep neural networks in learning patterns and
relationships has been proven on a vast array of data applications, images in
particular. To capture the characteristics of both powerful tools, we propose
\textit{TDA-Net}, a novel ensemble network that fuses topological and deep

scenarios thanks to the development of deep neural networks. The original GAN
was proposed based on the non-parametric assumption of the infinite capacity of
networks. However, it is still unknown whether GANs can generate realistic
samples without any prior information. Due to the overconfident assumption,
many issues remain unaddressed in GANs&#x27; training, such as non-convergence, mode
collapses, gradient vanishing. Regularization and normalization are common
methods of introducing prior information to stabilize training and improve
discrimination. Although a handful number of regularization and normalization
methods have been proposed for GANs, to the best of our knowledge, there exists
no comprehensive survey which primarily focuses on objectives and development
of these methods, apart from some in-comprehensive and limited scope studies.
In this work, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the regularization and
normalization techniques from different perspectives of GANs training. First,
we systematically describe different perspectives of GANs training and thus
obtain the different objectives of regularization and normalization. Based on
these objectives, we propose a new taxonomy. Furthermore, we compare the
performance of the mainstream methods on different datasets and investigate the
regularization and normalization techniques that have been frequently employed

for different stakeholders: Ex ante, sports betting companies can determine the
odds while sponsors and media companies can allocate their resources to
promising teams. Ex post, sports politicians and managers can benchmark the
performance of their teams and evaluate the drivers of success. To
significantly increase the Olympic medal forecasting accuracy, we apply machine
learning, more specifically a two-staged Random Forest, thus outperforming more
traditional na\&quot;ive forecast for three previous Olympics held between 2008 and
2016 for the first time. Regarding the Tokyo 2020 Games in 2021, our model
suggests that the United States will lead the Olympic medal table, winning 120
medals, followed by China (87) and Great Britain (74). Intriguingly, we predict
that the current COVID-19 pandemic will not significantly alter the medal count
as all countries suffer from the pandemic to some extent (data inherent) and
limited historical data points on comparable diseases (model inherent).</span>

                                        <span>This paper shows that decision trees constructed with Classification and
Regression Trees (CART) methodology are universally consistent in an additive
model context, even when the number of predictor variables scales exponentially
with the sample size, under certain $1$-norm sparsity constraints. The
consistency is universal in the sense that there are no a priori assumptions on
the distribution of the predictor variables. Amazingly, this adaptivity to
(approximate or exact) sparsity is achieved with a single tree, as opposed to
what might be expected for an ensemble. Finally, we show that these qualitative
properties of individual trees are inherited by Breiman&#x27;s random forests.
Another surprise is that consistency holds even when the &quot;mtry&quot; tuning
parameter vanishes as a fraction of the number of predictor variables, thus
speeding up computation of the forest. A key step in the analysis is the
establishment of an oracle inequality, which precisely characterizes the
goodness-of-fit and complexity tradeoff for a misspecified model.</span>

                                        <span>Mechanistic models with differential equations are a key component of
scientific applications of machine learning. Inference in such models is
usually computationally demanding, because it involves repeatedly solving the
differential equation. The main problem here is that the numerical solver is
hard to combine with standard inference techniques. Recent work in
probabilistic numerics has developed a new class of solvers for ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) that phrase the solution process directly in
terms of Bayesian filtering. We here show that this allows such methods to be
combined very directly, with conceptual and numerical ease, with latent force
models in the ODE itself. It then becomes possible to perform approximate
Bayesian inference on the latent force as well as the ODE solution in a single,
linear complexity pass of an extended Kalman filter / smoother - that is, at
the cost of computing a single ODE solution. We demonstrate the expressiveness
and performance of the algorithm by training, among others, a non-parametric
SIRD model on data from the COVID-19 outbreak.</span>

denoising autoencoder (DAE), namely noise learning based DAE (nlDAE). The
proposed nlDAE learns the noise of the input data. Then, the denoising is
performed by subtracting the regenerated noise from the noisy input. Hence,
nlDAE is more effective than DAE when the noise is simpler to regenerate than
the original data. To validate the performance of nlDAE, we provide three case
studies: signal restoration, symbol demodulation, and precise localization.
Numerical results suggest that nlDAE requires smaller latent space dimension
and smaller training dataset compared to DAE.</span>

                                        <span>Image captioning has recently demonstrated impressive progress largely owing
to the introduction of neural network algorithms trained on curated dataset
like MS-COCO. Often work in this field is motivated by the promise of
deployment of captioning systems in practical applications. However, the
scarcity of data and contexts in many competition datasets renders the utility
of systems trained on these datasets limited as an assistive technology in
real-world settings, such as helping visually impaired people navigate and
accomplish everyday tasks. This gap motivated the introduction of the novel
VizWiz dataset, which consists of images taken by the visually impaired and
captions that have useful, task-oriented information. In an attempt to help the
machine learning computer vision field realize its promise of producing
technologies that have positive social impact, the curators of the VizWiz
dataset host several competitions, including one for image captioning. This
work details the theory and engineering from our winning submission to the 2020
captioning competition. Our work provides a step towards improved assistive
image captioning systems.</span>

on framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for
graph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass
frequencies coefficients for network training, which then defines a
framelet-based graph convolution. The framelet decomposition naturally induces
a graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and
high-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the
graph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with
the proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art
performance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose
shrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds
high-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage
activation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression:
noises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately
cutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the
signal can be compressed to less than half its original size with
well-preserved prediction performance.</span>

                                        <span>We present a principled approach to incorporating labels in VAEs that
captures the rich characteristic information associated with those labels.
While prior work has typically conflated these by learning latent variables
that directly correspond to label values, we argue this is contrary to the
intended effect of supervision in VAEs-capturing rich label characteristics
with the latents. For example, we may want to capture the characteristics of a
face that make it look young, rather than just the age of the person. To this
end, we develop the CCVAE, a novel VAE model and concomitant variational
objective which captures label characteristics explicitly in the latent space,
eschewing direct correspondences between label values and latents. Through
judicious structuring of mappings between such characteristic latents and
labels, we show that the CCVAE can effectively learn meaningful representations
of the characteristics of interest across a variety of supervision schemes. In
particular, we show that the CCVAE allows for more effective and more general
interventions to be performed, such as smooth traversals within the
characteristics for a given label, diverse conditional generation, and
transferring characteristics across datapoints.</span>

specific prediction made by a complex black-box machine learning model? More
generally, how can we explain the model&#x27;s decisions to end-users in a
transparent way? We propose a new model-agnostic algorithm to identify a
minimal set of training samples that are indispensable for a given model&#x27;s
decision at a particular test point, i.e., the model&#x27;s decision would have
changed upon the removal of this subset from the training dataset. Our
algorithm identifies such a set of &quot;indispensable&quot; samples iteratively by
solving a constrained optimization problem. Further, we speed up the algorithm
through efficient approximations and provide theoretical justification for its
performance. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our
approach, we apply it to a variety of tasks including data poisoning detection,
training set debugging and understanding loan decisions. The results show that
our algorithm is an effective and easy-to-comprehend tool that helps to better
understand local model behavior, and therefore facilitates the adoption of
machine learning in domains where such understanding is a requisite.</span>

                                        <span>The design of methods for inference from time sequences has traditionally
relied on statistical models that describe the relation between a latent
desired sequence and the observed one. A broad family of model-based algorithms
have been derived to carry out inference at controllable complexity using
recursive computations over the factor graph representing the underlying
distribution. An alternative model-agnostic approach utilizes machine learning
(ML) methods. Here we propose a framework that combines model-based algorithms
and data-driven ML tools for stationary time sequences. In the proposed
approach, neural networks are developed to separately learn specific components
of a factor graph describing the distribution of the time sequence, rather than
the complete inference task. By exploiting stationary properties of this
distribution, the resulting approach can be applied to sequences of varying
temporal duration. Learned factor graph can be realized using compact neural
networks that are trainable using small training sets, or alternatively, be
used to improve upon existing deep inference systems. We present an inference
algorithm based on learned stationary factor graphs, which learns to implement
the sum-product scheme from labeled data, and can be applied to sequences of
different lengths. Our experimental results demonstrate the ability of the
proposed learned factor graphs to learn to carry out accurate inference from
small training sets for sleep stage detection using the Sleep-EDF dataset, as
well as for symbol detection in digital communications with unknown channels.</span>

                                        <span>Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world,
affecting over 70 million people. The cumbersome Standard Automated Perimetry
(SAP) test is most frequently used to detect visual loss due to glaucoma. Due
to the SAP test&#x27;s innate difficulty and its high test-retest variability, we
propose the RetiNerveNet, a deep convolutional recursive neural network for
obtaining estimates of the SAP visual field. RetiNerveNet uses information from
the more objective Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT).
RetiNerveNet attempts to trace-back the arcuate convergence of the retinal
nerve fibers, starting from the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness
around the optic disc, to estimate individual age-corrected 24-2 SAP values.
Recursive passes through the proposed network sequentially yield estimates of
the visual locations progressively farther from the optic disc. While all the
methods used for our experiments exhibit lower performance for the advanced
disease group, the proposed network is observed to be more accurate than all
the baselines for estimating the individual visual field values. We further
augment RetiNerveNet to additionally predict the SAP Mean Deviation values and
also create an ensemble of RetiNerveNets that further improves the performance,
by increasingly weighting-up underrepresented parts of the training data.</span>

                                        <span>Various iterative reconstruction algorithms for inverse problems can be
unfolded as neural networks. Empirically, this approach has often led to
improved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some
progress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great
challenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to
present a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable
for sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class
considered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm
(ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations
of ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at
learning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and
thereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive
linear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is
shared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for
dictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization
bound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis
classes consisting of such deep networks via Dudley&#x27;s integral. Remarkably,
under realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only
logarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of
measurements.</span>

we present a novel approach to accurate privacy accounting of the subsampled
Gaussian mechanism. This completes the previously proposed analysis by giving
strict lower and upper bounds for the privacy parameters. We demonstrate the

circumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial
perturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored
to defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g.
$\ell_\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these
methods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the
system. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously
significantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly
learns to generate noise to improve the model&#x27;s robustness against multiple
types of attacks. Its key component is Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs
optimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps
lower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples
generated by MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across
multiple perturbations. We validate the robustness of models trained by our
scheme on various datasets and against a wide variety of perturbations,
demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines across multiple
perturbations with a marginal computational cost.</span>

machine learning in the standard linear instrumental variable setting. The key
idea is to use machine learning, combined with sample-splitting, to predict the
treatment variable from the instrument and any exogenous covariates, and then
use this predicted treatment and the covariates as technical instruments to
recover the coefficients in the second-stage. This allows the researcher to
extract non-linear co-variation between the treatment and instrument that may
dramatically improve estimation precision and robustness by boosting instrument
strength. Importantly, we constrain the machine-learned predictions to be
linear in the exogenous covariates, thus avoiding spurious identification
arising from non-linear relationships between the treatment and the covariates.
We show that this approach delivers consistent and asymptotically normal
estimates under weak conditions and that it may be adapted to be
semiparametrically efficient (Chamberlain, 1992). Our method preserves standard
intuitions and interpretations of linear instrumental variable methods,
including under weak identification, and provides a simple, user-friendly
upgrade to the applied economics toolbox. We illustrate our method with an
example in law and criminal justice, examining the causal effect of appellate
court reversals on district court sentencing decisions.</span>

progressively and dynamically growing neural networks to jointly optimize the
networks&#x27; parameters and architectures. Our method works in a steepest descent
fashion, which iteratively finds the best network within a functional
neighborhood of the original network that includes a diverse set of candidate

structure in the neighborhood can be found with a greedy selection procedure.
We show that firefly descent can flexibly grow networks both wider and deeper,
and can be applied to learn accurate but resource-efficient neural
architectures that avoid catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.
Empirically, firefly descent achieves promising results on both neural
architecture search and continual learning. In particular, on a challenging

accurate imputation algorithms that can enable reliable traffic management in
the occasional absence of data. As one of the effective imputation approaches,
generative adversarial networks (GANs) are implicit generative models that can
be used for data imputation, which is formulated as an unsupervised learning
problem. This work introduces a novel iterative GAN architecture, called
Iterative Generative Adversarial Networks for Imputation (IGANI), for data
imputation. IGANI imputes data in two steps and maintains the invertibility of
the generative imputer, which will be shown to be a sufficient condition for
the convergence of the proposed GAN-based imputation. The performance of our
proposed method is evaluated on (1) the imputation of traffic speed data
collected in the city of Guangzhou in China, and the training of short-term
traffic prediction models using imputed data, and (2) the imputation of
multi-variable traffic data of highways in Portland-Vancouver metropolitan
region which includes volume, occupancy, and speed with different missing rates
for each of them. It is shown that our proposed algorithm mostly produces more
accurate results compared to those of previous GAN-based imputation
architectures.</span>

                                        <span>When dealing with deep neural network (DNN) applications on edge devices,
continuously updating the model is important. Although updating a model with
real incoming data is ideal, using all of them is not always feasible due to
limits, such as labeling and communication costs. Thus, it is necessary to
filter and select the data to use for training (i.e., active learning) on the
device. In this paper, we formalize a practical active learning problem for
DNNs on edge devices and propose a general task-agnostic framework to tackle
this problem, which reduces it to a stream submodular maximization. This
framework is light enough to be run with low computational resources, yet
provides solutions whose quality is theoretically guaranteed thanks to the
submodular property. Through this framework, we can configure data selection
criteria flexibly, including using methods proposed in previous active learning
studies. We evaluate our approach on both classification and object detection
tasks in a practical setting to simulate a real-life scenario. The results of
our study show that the proposed framework outperforms all other methods in
both tasks, while running at a practical speed on real devices.</span>

Gradient compression is a widely used approach to reduce communication traffic.
When combining with parallel communication mechanism method like pipeline,
gradient compression technique can greatly alleviate the impact of
communication overhead. However, there exists two problems of gradient
compression technique to be solved. Firstly, gradient compression brings in
extra computation cost, which will delay the next training iteration. Secondly,

                                        <span>To alleviate the data requirement for training effective binary classifiers
in binary classification, many weakly supervised learning settings have been
proposed. Among them, some consider using pairwise but not pointwise labels,
when pointwise labels are not accessible due to privacy, confidentiality, or
security reasons. However, as a pairwise label denotes whether or not two data
points share a pointwise label, it cannot be easily collected if either point
is equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
novel setting called pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification, where we have
only pairs of unlabeled data that we know one is more likely to be positive
than the other. Firstly, we give a Pcomp data generation process, derive an
unbiased risk estimator (URE) with theoretical guarantee, and further improve
URE using correction functions. Secondly, we link Pcomp classification to
noisy-label learning to develop a progressive URE and improve it by imposing
consistency regularization. Finally, we demonstrate by experiments the
effectiveness of our methods, which suggests Pcomp is a valuable and
practically useful type of pairwise supervision besides the pairwise label.</span>

learning from past data without the possibility of further exploration. Often
these applications require us to 1) identify a near optimal policy or to 2)
estimate the value of a target policy. For both tasks we derive
\emph{exponential} information-theoretic lower bounds in discounted infinite
horizon MDPs with a linear function representation for the action value
function even if 1) \emph{realizability} holds, 2) the batch algorithm observes
the exact reward and transition \emph{functions}, and 3) the batch algorithm is
given the \emph{best} a priori data distribution for the problem class. Our
work introduces a new &#x60;oracle + batch algorithm&#x27; framework to prove lower
bounds that hold for every distribution. The work shows an exponential
separation between batch and online reinforcement learning.</span>

                                        <span>There are currently many barriers that prevent non-experts from exploiting
machine learning solutions ranging from the lack of intuition on statistical
learning techniques to the trickiness of hyperparameter tuning. Such barriers
have led to an explosion of interest in automated machine learning (AutoML),
whereby an off-the-shelf system can take care of many of the steps for
end-users without the need for expertise in machine learning. This paper
presents Ensemble Squared (Ensemble$^2$), an AutoML system that ensembles the
results of state-of-the-art open-source AutoML systems. Ensemble$^2$ exploits
the diversity of existing AutoML systems by leveraging the differences in their
model search space and heuristics. Empirically, we show that diversity of each
AutoML system is sufficient to justify ensembling at the AutoML system level.
In demonstrating this, we also establish new state-of-the-art AutoML results on
the OpenML tabular classification benchmark.</span>

analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks,
and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of
potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward
pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path
space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the
hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation.
Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input
signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are
statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for
solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we
describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This
extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader
class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling
long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length
up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements
in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing
approaches.</span>

on sequential datasets. While there have been numerous attempts to solve this
problem in large-scale supervised classification, little has been done to
overcome catastrophic forgetting in few-shot classification problems. We
demonstrate that the popular gradient-based model-agnostic meta-learning
algorithm (MAML) indeed suffers from catastrophic forgetting and introduce a
Bayesian online meta-learning framework that tackles this problem. Our
framework utilises Bayesian online learning and meta-learning along with
Laplace approximation and variational inference to overcome catastrophic
forgetting in few-shot classification problems. The experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our framework can effectively achieve this goal in comparison
with various baselines. As an additional utility, we also demonstrate
empirically that our framework is capable of meta-learning on sequentially
arriving few-shot tasks from a stationary task distribution.</span>

neuroimaging data. Motivated by the neuroscience literature, we factorize the
covariances into sparse spatial and smooth temporal components. While this
factorization results in both parsimony and domain interpretability, the
resulting estimation problem is nonconvex. To this end, we design a two-stage
optimization scheme with a carefully tailored spectral initialization, combined
with iteratively refined alternating projected gradient descent. We prove a
linear convergence rate up to a nontrivial statistical error for the proposed
descent scheme and establish sample complexity guarantees for the estimator. We
further quantify the statistical error for the multivariate Gaussian case.

in which we propose to use it as an additional auxiliary training objective
acting as a data-dependent regularizer to promote more general and transferable
features. In particular, we present a novel attention-based spatial contrastive
objective to learn locally discriminative and class-agnostic features. As a
result, our approach overcomes some of the limitations of the cross-entropy
loss, such as its excessive discrimination towards seen classes, which reduces
the transferability of features to unseen classes. With extensive experiments,
we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,

                                        <span>In the era of big data, methods for improving memory and computational
efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies.
Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational
limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this
problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary
codes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes
intractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have
been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and
still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods
is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high
quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary
variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the
computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is
unnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral
hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead
of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to
the data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the
binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and
computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization
techniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain
the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show
that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly
competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low
complexity.</span>

                                        <span>Improving the robustness of neural nets in regression tasks is key to their
application in multiple domains. Deep learning-based approaches aim to achieve
this goal either by improving their prediction of specific values (i.e., point
prediction), or by producing prediction intervals (PIs) that quantify
uncertainty. We present PIVEN, a deep neural network for producing both a PI
and a value prediction. Our loss function expresses the value prediction as a
function of the upper and lower bounds, thus ensuring that it falls within the
interval without increasing model complexity. Moreover, our approach makes no
assumptions regarding data distribution within the PI, making its value
prediction more effective for various real-world problems. Experiments and
ablation tests on known benchmarks show that our approach produces tighter
uncertainty bounds than the current state-of-the-art approaches for producing
PIs, while maintaining comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approach
for value-prediction. Additionally, we go beyond previous work and include
large image datasets in our evaluation, where PIVEN is combined with modern
neural nets.</span>

with applications in distributed agent coordination, control, and planning
among others. Current GNN architectures assume ideal scenarios and ignore link
fluctuations that occur due to environment, human factors, or external attacks.
In these situations, the GNN fails to address its distributed task if the
topological randomness is not considered accordingly. To overcome this issue,
we put forth the stochastic graph neural network (SGNN) model: a GNN where the
distributed graph convolution module accounts for the random network changes.
Since stochasticity brings in a new learning paradigm, we conduct a statistical
analysis on the SGNN output variance to identify conditions the learned filters
should satisfy for achieving robust transference to perturbed scenarios,
ultimately revealing the explicit impact of random link losses. We further
develop a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based learning process for the SGNN
and derive conditions on the learning rate under which this learning process
converges to a stationary point. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical
findings and compare the benefits of SGNN robust transference with a
conventional GNN that ignores graph perturbations during learning.</span>

substantially facilitate software developers&#x27; works and coordination. However,
the semantic gap between source code and natural language poses a major
challenge for the task. Several studies have been proposed to alleviate the
challenge but none explicitly involves code contextual information during
commit message generation. Specifically, existing research adopts static
embedding for code tokens, which maps a token to the same vector regardless of
its context. In this paper, we propose a novel Contextualized code
representation learning strategy for commit message Generation (CoreGen).
CoreGen first learns contextualized code representations which exploit the
contextual information behind code commit sequences. The learned
representations of code commits built upon Transformer are then fine-tuned for
downstream commit message generation. Experiments on the benchmark dataset
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our model over the baseline models
with at least 28.18% improvement in terms of BLEU-4 score. Furthermore, we also
highlight the future opportunities in training contextualized code
representations on larger code corpus as a solution to low-resource tasks and
adapting the contextualized code representation framework to other code-to-text

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning is a general technique that allows an agent to learn
an optimal policy and interact with an environment in sequential decision
making problems. The goodness of a policy is measured by its value function
starting from some initial state. The focus of this paper is to construct
confidence intervals (CIs) for a policy&#x27;s value in infinite horizon settings
where the number of decision points diverges to infinity. We propose to model
the action-value state function (Q-function) associated with a policy based on
series/sieve method to derive its confidence interval. When the target policy
depends on the observed data as well, we propose a SequentiAl Value Evaluation
(SAVE) method to recursively update the estimated policy and its value
estimator. As long as either the number of trajectories or the number of
decision points diverges to infinity, we show that the proposed CI achieves
nominal coverage even in cases where the optimal policy is not unique.
Simulation studies are conducted to back up our theoretical findings. We apply
the proposed method to a dataset from mobile health studies and find that
reinforcement learning algorithms could help improve patient&#x27;s health status. A
Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at

                                        <span>We show that the influence of a subset of the training samples can be removed
-- or &quot;forgotten&quot; -- from the weights of a network trained on large-scale image
classification tasks, and we provide strong computable bounds on the amount of
remaining information after forgetting. Inspired by real-world applications of
forgetting techniques, we introduce a novel notion of forgetting in
mixed-privacy setting, where we know that a &quot;core&quot; subset of the training
samples does not need to be forgotten. While this variation of the problem is
conceptually simple, we show that working in this setting significantly
improves the accuracy and guarantees of forgetting methods applied to vision
classification tasks. Moreover, our method allows efficient removal of all
information contained in non-core data by simply setting to zero a subset of
the weights with minimal loss in performance. We achieve these results by
replacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With
opportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show
that such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original
network and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved
efficiently even for large models. Unlike previous forgetting methods on deep
networks, ours can achieve close to the state-of-the-art accuracy on large
scale vision tasks. In particular, we show that our method allows forgetting
without having to trade off the model accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Entity matching (EM) refers to the problem of identifying tuple pairs in one
or more relations that refer to the same real world entities. Supervised
machine learning (ML) approaches, and deep learning based approaches in
particular, typically achieve state-of-the-art matching results. However, these
approaches require many labeled examples, in the form of matching and
non-matching pairs, which are expensive and time-consuming to label. In this
paper, we introduce Panda, a weakly supervised system specifically designed for
EM. Panda uses the same labeling function abstraction as Snorkel, where
labeling functions (LF) are user-provided programs that can generate large
amounts of (somewhat noisy) labels quickly and cheaply, which can then be
combined via a labeling model to generate accurate final predictions. To
support users developing LFs for EM, Panda provides an integrated development
environment (IDE) that lives in a modern browser architecture. Panda&#x27;s IDE
facilitates the development, debugging, and life-cycle management of LFs in the
context of EM tasks, similar to how IDEs such as Visual Studio or Eclipse excel
in general-purpose programming. Panda&#x27;s IDE includes many novel features
purpose-built for EM, such as smart data sampling, a builtin library of EM
utility functions, automatically generated LFs, visual debugging of LFs, and
finally, an EM-specific labeling model. We show in this demo that Panda IDE can
greatly accelerate the development of high-quality EM solutions using weak
supervision.</span>

stochastic gradient Langevin framework for the training of deep neural
networks. Constraints allow direct control of the parameter space of the model.
Appropriately designed, they reduce the vanishing/exploding gradient problem,
control weight magnitudes and stabilize deep neural networks and thus improve
the robustness of training algorithms and the generalization capabilities of
the trained neural network. We present examples of constrained training methods
motivated by orthogonality preservation for weight matrices and explicit weight
normalizations. We describe the methods in the overdamped formulation of
Langevin dynamics and the underdamped form, in which momenta help to improve
sampling efficiency. The methods are explored in test examples in image

                                        <span>To use neural networks in safety-critical settings it is paramount to provide
assurances on their runtime operation. Recent work on ReLU networks has sought
to verify whether inputs belonging to a bounded box can ever yield some
undesirable output. Input-splitting procedures, a particular type of
verification mechanism, do so by recursively partitioning the input set into
smaller sets. The efficiency of these methods is largely determined by the
number of splits the box must undergo before the property can be verified. In
this work, we propose a new technique based on shadow prices that fully
exploits the information of the problem yielding a more efficient generation of
splits than the state-of-the-art. Results on the Airborne Collision Avoidance
System (ACAS) benchmark verification tasks show a considerable reduction in the
partitions generated which substantially reduces computation times. These
results open the door to improved verification methods for a wide variety of
machine learning applications including vision and control.</span>

                                        <span>Neural shape representations have recently shown to be effective in shape
analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing neural network methods require
point coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level
sets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data,
therefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing
stages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a
divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require
normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the
divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably
orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even
better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly.
Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for
sinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to
the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task
of surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to
other unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.</span>

(AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A
brief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is
provided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to
how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,
iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information
extraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the
successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these
areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and
its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near
future, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or
collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the
successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is
the &#x60;creator&#x27;, remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win
awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also
limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the
context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where
its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than
replace, human creativity.</span>

the conditional mean outcome and the logging policy (the probability of
choosing an action), is crucial in causal inference. This paper proposes a DR
estimator for dependent samples obtained from adaptive experiments. To obtain
an asymptotically normal semiparametric estimator from dependent samples with
non-Donsker nuisance estimators, we propose adaptive-fitting as a variant of
sample-splitting. We also report an empirical paradox that our proposed DR
estimator tends to show better performances compared to other estimators
utilizing the true logging policy. While a similar phenomenon is known for
estimators with i.i.d. samples, traditional explanations based on asymptotic
efficiency cannot elucidate our case with dependent samples. We confirm this
hypothesis through simulation studies.</span>

paramount importance to improve evaluation processes. In this context, we
analyzed whether bibliometric features are able to predict the success of
research grants. We extracted features aiming at characterizing the academic
history of Brazilian researchers, including research topics, affiliations,
number of publications and visibility. The extracted features were then used to
predict grants productivity via machine learning in three major research areas,
namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. We found that research
subject and publication history play a role in predicting productivity. In
addition, institution-based features turned out to be relevant when combined
with other features. While the best results outperformed text-based attributes,
the evaluated features were not highly discriminative. Our findings indicate
that predicting grants success, at least with the considered set of
bibliometric features, is not a trivial task.</span>

                                        <span>Developing efficient and principled neural architecture optimization methods
is a critical challenge of modern deep learning. Recently, Liu et al.[19]
proposed a splitting steepest descent (S2D) method that jointly optimizes the
neural parameters and architectures based on progressively growing network
structures by splitting neurons into multiple copies in a steepest descent
fashion. However, S2D suffers from a local optimality issue when all the
neurons become &quot;splitting stable&quot;, a concept akin to local stability in
parametric optimization. In this work, we develop a significant and surprising
extension of the splitting descent framework that addresses the local
optimality issue. The idea is to observe that the original S2D is unnecessarily
restricted to splitting neurons into positive weighted copies. By simply
allowing both positive and negative weights during splitting, we can eliminate
the appearance of splitting stability in S2D and hence escape the local optima
to obtain better performance. By incorporating signed splittings, we
significantly extend the optimization power of splitting steepest descent both
theoretically and empirically. We verify our method on various challenging
benchmarks such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet and ModelNet40, on which we outperform
S2D and other advanced methods on learning accurate and energy-efficient neural
networks.</span>

real-world problems that remained unsolved for more than a decade. Automatic
caption generation is a major research field, and the research community has
done a lot of work on it in most common languages like English. Urdu is the
national language of Pakistan and also much spoken and understood in the
sub-continent region of Pakistan-India, and yet no work has been done for Urdu
language caption generation. Our research aims to fill this gap by developing
an attention-based deep learning model using techniques of sequence modeling
specialized for the Urdu language. We have prepared a dataset in the Urdu
language by translating a subset of the &quot;Flickr8k&quot; dataset containing 700 &#x27;man&#x27;
images. We evaluate our proposed technique on this dataset and show that it can
achieve a BLEU score of 0.83 in the Urdu language. We improve on the previous
state-of-the-art by using better CNN architectures and optimization techniques.
Furthermore, we provide a discussion on how the generated captions can be made
correct grammar-wise.</span>

computer vision tasks, it is recently found that they are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. In this paper, we focus on the so-called \textit{backdoor
attack}, which injects a backdoor trigger to a small portion of training data
(also known as data poisoning) such that the trained DNN induces
misclassification while facing examples with this trigger. To be specific, we
carefully study the effect of both real and synthetic backdoor attacks on the
internal response of vanilla and backdoored DNNs through the lens of Gard-CAM.
Moreover, we show that the backdoor attack induces a significant bias in neuron
activation in terms of the $\ell_\infty$ norm of an activation map compared to
its $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm. Spurred by our results, we propose the
\textit{$\ell_\infty$-based neuron pruning} to remove the backdoor from the
backdoored DNN. Experiments show that our method could effectively decrease the
attack success rate, and also hold a high classification accuracy for clean
images.</span>

                                        <span>Although the quest for more accurate solutions is pushing deep learning
research towards larger and more complex algorithms, edge devices demand
efficient inference and therefore reduction in model size, latency and energy
consumption. One technique to limit model size is quantization, which implies
using fewer bits to represent weights and biases. Such an approach usually
results in a decline in performance. Here, we introduce a method for designing
optimally heterogeneously quantized versions of deep neural network models for
minimum-energy, high-accuracy, nanosecond inference and fully automated
deployment on chip. With a per-layer, per-parameter type automatic quantization
procedure, sampling from a wide range of quantizers, model energy consumption
and size are minimized while high accuracy is maintained. This is crucial for
the event selection procedure in proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider, where resources are strictly limited and a latency of
${\mathcal O}(1)~\mu$s is required. Nanosecond inference and a resource
consumption reduced by a factor of 50 when implemented on field-programmable
gate array hardware are achieved.</span>

Alzheimer&#x27;s has been a major research focus in the last decade. However, to
infer cause-effect relationships rather than simple associations from
observational data, we need to (i) express the causal relationships leading to
cognitive decline in a graphical model, and (ii) ensure the causal effect of
interest is identifiable from the collected data. We derive a causal graph from
the current clinical knowledge on cause and effect in the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
continuum, and show that identifiability of the causal effect requires all
confounders to be known and measured. However, in complex neuroimaging studies,
we neither know all potential confounders nor do we have data on them. To
alleviate this requirement, we leverage the dependencies among multiple causes
by deriving a substitute confounder via a probabilistic latent factor model. In
our theoretical analysis, we prove that using the substitute confounder enables
identifiability of the causal effect of neuroanatomy on cognition. We
quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on semi-synthetic
data, where we know the true causal effects, and illustrate its use on real
data on the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease continuum, where it reveals important causes
that otherwise would have been missed.</span>

static graph-based indicators in order to study the temporal evolution of
relevant network components, and to reveal complex dependencies that would not
be easily detected by a direct inspection of the data. This paper presents a
state-of-the-art latent network model to forecast multilayer dynamic graphs
that are increasingly common in transportation and proposes a community-based
extension to reduce the computational burden. Flexible time series analysis is
obtained by modeling the probability of edges between vertices through latent
Gaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference are illustrated on a
sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air
transportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters from
the models are related to the airline&#x27;s connectivity dynamics, and their
ability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full
network forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification
of relevant communities. Reliable network predictions would allow policy-makers
to better understand the dynamics of the transport system, and help in their

turn, both inference time and the memory footprint are reduced, enabling quick

paper, we give a simple new characterization that illuminates the core problem
of adaptive data analysis. We show explicitly that the harms of adaptivity come
from the covariance between the behavior of future queries and a Bayes
factor-based measure of how much information about the data sample was encoded
in the responses given to past queries. We leverage this intuition to introduce
a new stability notion; we then use it to prove new generalization results for
the most basic noise-addition mechanisms (Laplace and Gaussian noise addition),
with guarantees that scale with the variance of the queries rather than the
square of their range. Our characterization opens the door to new insights and
new algorithms for the fundamental problem of achieving generalization in
adaptive data analysis.</span>

evasion attacks on testing data and poisoning attacks on training data. In this
work, we show that adversarial examples, originally intended for attacking
pre-trained models, are even more effective for data poisoning than recent
methods designed specifically for poisoning. Our findings indicate that
adversarial examples, when assigned the original label of their natural base
image, cannot be used to train a classifier for natural images. Furthermore,
when adversarial examples are assigned their adversarial class label, they are
useful for training. This suggests that adversarial examples contain useful
semantic content, just with the &#x60;&#x60;wrong&#x27;&#x27; labels (according to a network, but
not a human). Our method, adversarial poisoning, is substantially more
effective than existing poisoning methods for secure dataset release, and we
release a poisoned version of ImageNet, ImageNet-P, to encourage research into
the strength of this form of data obfuscation.</span>

                                        <span>We show a simple reduction which demonstrates the cryptographic hardness of
learning a single periodic neuron over isotropic Gaussian distributions in the
presence of noise. More precisely, our reduction shows that any polynomial-time
algorithm (not necessarily gradient-based) for learning such functions under
small noise implies a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving worst-case
lattice problems, whose hardness form the foundation of lattice-based
cryptography. Our core hard family of functions, which are well-approximated by
one-layer neural networks, take the general form of a univariate periodic
function applied to an affine projection of the data. These functions have
appeared in previous seminal works which demonstrate their hardness against
gradient-based (Shamir&#x27;18), and Statistical Query (SQ) algorithms (Song et
al.&#x27;17). We show that if (polynomially) small noise is added to the labels, the
intractability of learning these functions applies to all polynomial-time
algorithms under the aforementioned cryptographic assumptions.

Moreover, we demonstrate the necessity of noise in the hardness result by
designing a polynomial-time algorithm for learning certain families of such
functions under exponentially small adversarial noise. Our proposed algorithm
is not a gradient-based or an SQ algorithm, but is rather based on the
celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\&#x27;asz (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm.
Furthermore, in the absence of noise, this algorithm can be directly applied to
solve CLWE detection (Bruna et al.&#x27;21) and phase retrieval with an optimal
sample complexity of $d+1$ samples. In the former case, this improves upon the
quadratic-in-$d$ sample complexity required in (Bruna et al.&#x27;21). In the latter
case, this improves upon the state-of-the-art AMP-based algorithm, which
requires approximately $1.128d$ samples (Barbier et al.&#x27;19).</span>

parameters into &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; parts which are trained simultaneously using
different learning rates. By choosing appropriate partitionings we can obtain
large computational speed-ups for transfer learning tasks. We show that for
various transfer learning applications in vision and NLP we can fine-tune deep
neural networks in almost half the time, without reducing the generalization
performance of the resulting model. We also discuss other splitting choices for
the neural network parameters which are beneficial in enhancing generalization
performance in settings where neural networks are trained from scratch.
Finally, we propose an additional multirate technique which can learn different
features present in the data by training the full network on different time
scales simultaneously. The benefits of using this approach are illustrated for
ResNet architectures on image data. Our paper unlocks the potential of using
multirate techniques for neural network training and provides many starting

Signature-based malware detection methods are limited in detecting new malware
samples that are significantly different from known ones. Therefore, machine
learning-based methods have been proposed, but there are two challenges these
methods face. The first is to model the full semantics behind the assembly code
of malware. The second challenge is to provide interpretable results while
keeping excellent detection performance. In this paper, we propose an
Interpretable MAlware Detector (I-MAD) that outperforms state-of-the-art static
malware detection models regarding accuracy with excellent interpretability. To
improve the detection performance, I-MAD incorporates a novel network component
called the Galaxy Transformer network that can understand assembly code at the
basic block, function, and executable levels. It also incorporates our proposed
interpretable feed-forward neural network to provide interpretations for its
detection results by quantifying the impact of each feature with respect to the
prediction. Experiment results show that our model significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art static malware detection models and presents
meaningful interpretations.</span>

improve the lives of many through automation, natural language processing,
predictive analytics and much more. However, a major concern is the fact that
we&#x27;re fast approach the threshold of the maximum possible computational
capacity available to us by the means of classical computing devices including
CPUs, GPUs and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This is due to
the exponential increase in model sizes which now have parameters in the
magnitude of billions and trillions, requiring a significant amount of
computing resources across a significant amount of time, just to converge one
single model. To observe the efficacy of using quantum computing for certain
machine learning tasks and explore the improved potential of convergence, error
reduction and robustness to noisy data, this paper will look forth to test and
verify the aspects in which quantum machine learning can help improve over
classical machine learning approaches while also shedding light on the likely
limitations that have prevented quantum approaches to become the mainstream. A
major focus will be to recreate the work by Farhi et al and conduct experiments
using their theory of performing machine learning in a quantum context, with

                                        <span>Acoustic Event Classification (AEC) has become a significant task for
machines to perceive the surrounding auditory scene. However, extracting
effective representations that capture the underlying characteristics of the
acoustic events is still challenging. Previous methods mainly focused on
designing the audio features in a &#x60;hand-crafted&#x27; manner. Interestingly,
data-learnt features have been recently reported to show better performance. Up
to now, these were only considered on the frame level. In this article, we
propose an unsupervised learning framework to learn a vector representation of
an audio sequence for AEC. This framework consists of a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) encoder and an RNN decoder, which respectively transforms the
variable-length audio sequence into a fixed-length vector and reconstructs the
input sequence on the generated vector. After training the encoder-decoder, we
feed the audio sequences to the encoder and then take the learnt vectors as the
audio sequence representations. Compared with previous methods, the proposed
method can not only deal with the problem of arbitrary-lengths of audio
streams, but also learn the salient information of the sequence. Extensive
evaluation on a large-size acoustic event database is performed, and the
empirical results demonstrate that the learnt audio sequence representation
yields a significant performance improvement by a large margin compared with
other state-of-the-art hand-crafted sequence features for AEC.</span>

its initialization, kernel, or learning rate, based on data sampled from a
number of auxiliary tasks. A key underlying assumption is that the auxiliary
tasks, known as meta-training tasks, share the same generating distribution as
the tasks to be encountered at deployment time, known as meta-test tasks. This
may, however, not be the case when the test environment differ from the
meta-training conditions. To address shifts in task generating distribution
between meta-training and meta-testing phases, this paper introduces weighted
free energy minimization (WFEM) for transfer meta-learning. We instantiate the
proposed approach for non-parametric Bayesian regression and classification via
Gaussian Processes (GPs). The method is validated on a toy sinusoidal
regression problem, as well as on classification using miniImagenet and CUB

                                        <span>EEG technology finds applications in several domains. Currently, most EEG
systems require subjects to wear several electrodes on the scalp to be
effective. However, several channels might include noisy information, redundant
signals, induce longer preparation times and increase computational times of
any automated system for EEG decoding. One way to reduce the signal-to-noise
ratio and improve classification accuracy is to combine channel selection with
feature extraction, but EEG signals are known to present high inter-subject
variability. In this work we introduce a novel algorithm for
subject-independent channel selection of EEG recordings. Considering
multi-channel trial recordings as statistical units and the EEG decoding task
as the class of reference, the algorithm (i) exploits channel-specific
1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) as feature extractors in a
supervised fashion to maximize class separability; (ii) it reduces a high
dimensional multi-channel trial representation into a unique trial vector by
concatenating the channels&#x27; embeddings and (iii) recovers the complex
inter-channel relationships during channel selection, by exploiting an ensemble
of AutoEncoders (AE) to identify from these vectors the most relevant channels
to perform classification. After training, the algorithm can be exploited by
transferring only the parametrized subgroup of selected channel-specific
1D-CNNs to new signals from new subjects and obtain low-dimensional and highly
informative trial vectors to be fed to any classifier.</span>

circuit boards (PCBs) with irregular board shapes and multi-layer stackup is
computationally inefficient using full-wave simulations. This paper presents a
new concept of using deep learning for PDN impedance prediction. A boundary
element method (BEM) is applied to efficiently calculate the impedance for
arbitrary board shape and stackup. Then over one million boards with different
shapes, stackup, IC location, and decap placement are randomly generated to
train a deep neural network (DNN). The trained DNN can predict the impedance
accurately for new board configurations that have not been used for training.
The consumed time using the trained DNN is only 0.1 seconds, which is over 100
times faster than the BEM method and 5000 times faster than full-wave
simulations.</span>

                                        <span>The discovery of causal relationships is a fundamental problem in science and
medicine. In recent years, many elegant approaches to discovering causal
relationships between two variables from observational data have been proposed.
However, most of these deal only with purely directed causal relationships and
cannot detect latent common causes. Here, we devise a general heuristic which
takes a causal discovery algorithm that can only distinguish purely directed
causal relations and modifies it to also detect latent common causes. We apply
our method to two directed causal discovery algorithms, the Information
Geometric Causal Inference of (Daniusis et al., 2010) and the Kernel
Conditional Deviance for Causal Inference of (Mitrovic, Sejdinovic, &amp; Teh,
2018), and extensively test on synthetic data -- detecting latent common causes
in additive, multiplicative and complex noise regimes -- and on real data,
where we are able to detect known common causes. In addition to detecting
latent common causes, our experiments demonstrate that both the modified
algorithms preserve the performance of the original in distinguishing directed
causal relations.</span>

across materials composition spaces are essential, but demonstrations of ML
have been primarily limited to narrow composition variations. By addressing the
scarcity of data in promising regions of chemical space for challenging targets
like open-shell transition-metal complexes, general representations and
transferable ML models that leverage known relationships in existing data will
accelerate discovery. Over a large set (ca. 1000) of isovalent transition-metal
complexes, we quantify evident relationships for different properties (i.e.,
spin-splitting and ligand dissociation) between rows of the periodic table
(i.e., 3d/4d metals and 2p/3p ligands). We demonstrate an extension to
graph-based revised autocorrelation (RAC) representation (i.e., eRAC) that
incorporates the effective nuclear charge alongside the nuclear charge
heuristic that otherwise overestimates dissimilarity of isovalent complexes. To
address the common challenge of discovery in a new space where data is limited,
we introduce a transfer learning approach in which we seed models trained on a
large amount of data from one row of the periodic table with a small number of
data points from the additional row. We demonstrate the synergistic value of
the eRACs alongside this transfer learning strategy to consistently improve
model performance. Analysis of these models highlights how the approach
succeeds by reordering the distances between complexes to be more consistent
with the periodic table, a property we expect to be broadly useful for other
materials domains.</span>

                                        <span>Scaling adaptive traffic-signal control involves dealing with combinatorial
state and action spaces. Multi-agent reinforcement learning attempts to address
this challenge by distributing control to specialized agents. However,
specialization hinders generalization and transferability, and the
computational graphs underlying neural-networks architectures -- dominating in
the multi-agent setting -- do not offer the flexibility to handle an arbitrary
number of entities which changes both between road networks, and over time as
vehicles traverse the network. We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement
Learning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the
structure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of
traffic-controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables
learning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being
trained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new
road networks, traffic distributions, and traffic regimes, with no additional
training and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability
compared to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the
granularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the
lane and the vehicle levels. The proposed method is tested on both road
networks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We compare
IG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific baselines. In
both synthetic road networks and in a larger experiment involving the control
of the 3,971 traffic signals of Manhattan, we show that different
instantiations of IG-RL outperform baselines.</span>

participation in federated learning. In this paper, we show -- theoretically
and through simulations -- that Shapley Value underestimates the contribution
of a common type of client: the Maverick. Mavericks are clients that differ
both in data distribution and data quantity and can be the sole owners of
certain types of data. Selecting the right clients at the right moment is
important for federated learning to reduce convergence times and improve
accuracy. We propose FedEMD, an adaptive client selection strategy based on the
Wasserstein distance between the local and global data distributions. As FedEMD
adapts the selection probability such that Mavericks are preferably selected
when the model benefits from improvement on rare classes, it consistently
ensures the fast convergence in the presence of different types of Mavericks.
Compared to existing strategies, including Shapley Value-based ones, FedEMD
improves the convergence of neural network classifiers by at least 26.9% for
FedAvg aggregation compared with the state of the art.</span>

throughout training. The use of customized, appropriately designed constraints
can reduce the vanishing/exploding gradients problem, improve smoothness of
classification boundaries, control weight magnitudes and stabilize deep neural
networks, and thus enhance the robustness of training algorithms and the
generalization capabilities of neural networks. We provide a general approach
to efficiently incorporate constraints into a stochastic gradient Langevin

specific examples of constrained training methods motivated by orthogonality
preservation for weight matrices and explicit weight normalizations.
Discretization schemes are provided both for the overdamped formulation of
Langevin dynamics and the underdamped form, in which momenta further improve

adding generative regularization to Bayesian inference framework. Bayesian
method provides a general framework for continual learning. We could further
construct a generative regularization term for all given classification models
by leveraging energy-based models and Langevin-dynamic sampling to enrich the
features learned in each task. By combining discriminative and generative loss
together, we empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on a variety of tasks, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting in continual learning. In particular, the proposed method
outperforms baseline methods over 15% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and 10% on

                                        <span>\textit{Differentiable ARchiTecture Search} (DARTS) has recently become the
mainstream of neural architecture search (NAS) due to its efficiency and
simplicity. With a gradient-based bi-level optimization, DARTS alternately
optimizes the inner model weights and the outer architecture parameter in a
weight-sharing supernet. A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the
learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop
optimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal
factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received
less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS
based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained
solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path.
To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic
hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that
the architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is
expected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two
NAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method. It leads to architectures outperforming,
with large margins, those learned by the baseline methods.</span>

                                        <span>Network embedding has been widely used in social recommendation and network
analysis, such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection with graphs.
However, most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently,
due to that (i) computation on graphs is often costly and (ii) the size of
graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large,
rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine. In this paper, we
propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding
on large graphs using Apache Spark, which recursively partitions a graph into
several small-sized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural
information of nodes, and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph
in parallel. Finally, by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs, we obtain
the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost. After that, we demonstrate in various
experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions
of edges within a few hours and is at least 4 times faster than the
state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, it achieves up to $4.25\%$ and $4.27\%$
improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively. In
the end, we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of Tencent with
the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation, which
improve the competitors by up to $91.11\%$ in running time and up to $12.80\%$
in the corresponding evaluation metrics.</span>

handling invariant data such as point clouds and graphs. However, a
generalization theory for the neural networks has not been well developed,
because several essential factors for the theory, such as network size and
margin distribution, are not deeply connected to the invariance and
equivariance. In this study, we develop a novel generalization error bound for
invariant and equivariant deep neural networks. To describe the effect of
invariance and equivariance on generalization, we develop a notion of a
\textit{quotient feature space}, which measures the effect of group actions for
the properties. Our main result proves that the volume of quotient feature
spaces can describe the generalization error. Furthermore, the bound shows that
the invariance and equivariance significantly improve the leading term of the
bound. We apply our result to specific invariant and equivariant networks, such
as DeepSets (Zaheer et al. (2017)), and show that their generalization bound is
considerably improved by $\sqrt{n!}$, where $n!$ is the number of permutations.
We also discuss the expressive power of invariant DNNs and show that they can
achieve an optimal approximation rate. Our experimental result supports our
theoretical claims.</span>

probabilistic programs with recursion and conditioning. Our starting point is
an open problem posed by Hongseok Yang: what class of statistical probabilistic
programs have densities that are differentiable almost everywhere? To formalise
the problem, we consider Statistical PCF (SPCF), an extension of call-by-value
PCF with real numbers, and constructs for sampling and conditioning. We give
SPCF a sampling-style operational semantics a la Borgstrom et al., and study
the associated weight (commonly referred to as the density) function and value
function on the set of possible execution traces. Our main result is that
almost-surely terminating SPCF programs, generated from a set of primitive
functions (e.g. the set of analytic functions) satisfying mild closure
properties, have weight and value functions that are almost-everywhere
differentiable. We use a stochastic form of symbolic execution to reason about
almost-everywhere differentiability. A by-product of this work is that
almost-surely terminating deterministic (S)PCF programs with real parameters
denote functions that are almost-everywhere differentiable. Our result is of
practical interest, as almost-everywhere differentiability of the density
function is required to hold for the correctness of major gradient-based
inference algorithms.</span>

auto-encoders, multi-target regression, and matrix factorization, to name a
few. Despite computational advantages due to its differentiability, it is not
robust to outliers. In contrast, l_p norms are known to be robust, but cannot
be optimized via, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, as they are
non-differentiable. We propose an algorithm inspired by so-called model-based
optimization (MBO) [35, 36], which replaces a non-convex objective with a
convex model function and alternates between optimizing the model function and
updating the solution. We apply this to robust regression, proposing SADM, a
stochastic variant of the Online Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers

with the rate O(log T/T). Finally, we demonstrate experimentally (a) the
robustness of l_p norms to outliers and (b) the efficiency of our proposed

                                        <span>As the analytic tools become more powerful, and more data are generated on a
daily basis, the issue of data privacy arises. This leads to the study of the
design of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. Given two objectives,
namely, utility maximization and privacy-loss minimization, this work is based
on two previously non-intersecting regimes -- Compressive Privacy and
multi-kernel method. Compressive Privacy is a privacy framework that employs
utility-preserving lossy-encoding scheme to protect the privacy of the data,
while multi-kernel method is a kernel based machine learning regime that
explores the idea of using multiple kernels for building better predictors. The
compressive multi-kernel method proposed consists of two stages -- the
compression stage and the multi-kernel stage. The compression stage follows the
Compressive Privacy paradigm to provide the desired privacy protection. Each
kernel matrix is compressed with a lossy projection matrix derived from the
Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA). The multi-kernel stage uses the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) score of each kernel to non-uniformly combine
multiple compressive kernels. The proposed method is evaluated on two
mobile-sensing datasets -- MHEALTH and HAR -- where activity recognition is
defined as utility and person identification is defined as privacy. The results
show that the compression regime is successful in privacy preservation as the
privacy classification accuracies are almost at the random-guess level in all
experiments. On the other hand, the novel SNR-based multi-kernel shows utility
classification accuracy improvement upon the state-of-the-art in both datasets.
These results indicate a promising direction for research in privacy-preserving
machine learning.</span>

                                        <span>Outlier detection is a significant area in data mining. It can be either used
to pre-process the data prior to an analysis or post the processing phase
(before visualization) depending on the effectiveness of the outlier and its
importance. Outlier detection extends to several fields such as detection of
credit card fraud, network intrusions, machine failure prediction, potential
terrorist attacks, and so on. Outliers are those data points with
characteristics considerably different. They deviate from the data set causing
inconsistencies, noise and anomalies during analysis and result in modification
of the original points However, a common misconception is that outliers have to
be immediately eliminated or replaced from the data set. Such points could be
considered useful if analyzed separately as they could be obtained from a
separate mechanism entirely making it important to the research question. This
study surveys the different methods of outlier detection for spatial analysis.
Spatial data or geospatial data are those that exhibit geographic properties or
attributes such as position or areas. An example would be weather data such as
precipitation, temperature, wind velocity, and so on collected for a defined
region.</span>

estimating model-centric importance of individual pixels in the input. However,
class-insensitivity of the earlier layers in a network only allows saliency
computation with low resolution activation maps of the deeper layers, resulting
in compromised image saliency. Remedifying this can lead to sanity failures. We
propose CAMERAS, a technique to compute high-fidelity backpropagation saliency
maps without requiring any external priors and preserving the map sanity. Our
method systematically performs multi-scale accumulation and fusion of the
activation maps and backpropagated gradients to compute precise saliency maps.
From accurate image saliency to articulation of relative importance of input
features for different models, and precise discrimination between model
perception of visually similar objects, our high-resolution mapping offers
multiple novel insights into the black-box deep visual models, which are
presented in the paper. We also demonstrate the utility of our saliency maps in
adversarial setup by drastically reducing the norm of attack signals by
focusing them on the precise regions identified by our maps. Our method also
inspires new evaluation metrics and a sanity check for this developing research
direction. Code is available here https://github.com/VisMIL/CAMERAS</span>

new classes in a set of unlabeled samples given a labeled dataset with known
classes. We exploit the peculiarities of NCD to build a new framework, named
Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL), to learn discriminative
representations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution
is twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set
generates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are
likely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and
aggregate pseudo-positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the
model to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most
of the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to
the contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate hard
negatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We
experimentally demonstrate that these two ingredients significantly contribute
to clustering performance and lead our model to outperform state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin (e.g., clustering accuracy +13% on CIFAR-100 and +8%
on ImageNet).</span>

understanding the robustness of GNNs under adversarial attacks, especially in

restricted and realistic setup, by perturbing the features of a small set of
nodes, with no access to model parameters and model predictions. Our formal
analysis draws a connection between this type of attacks and an influence
maximization problem on the graph. This connection not only enhances our
understanding on the problem of adversarial attack on GNNs, but also allows us
to propose a group of effective and practical attack strategies. Our

variables through the partial derivative. Treating the coupled variables
independently while ignoring the interaction, however, leads to an insufficient
optimization for bilinear models. In this paper, we propose a dependable
learning based on Cogradient Descent (CoGD) algorithm to address the bilinear
optimization problem, providing a systematic way to coordinate the gradients of
coupling variables based on a kernelized projection function. CoGD is
introduced to solve bilinear problems when one variable is with sparsity
constraint, as often occurs in modern learning paradigms. CoGD can also be used
to decompose the association of features and weights, which further generalizes
our method to better train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and improve the
model capacity. CoGD is applied in representative bilinear problems, including
image reconstruction, image inpainting, network pruning and CNN training.
Extensive experiments show that CoGD improves the state-of-the-arts by
significant margins. Code is available at

                                        <span>The uptake of machine learning (ML) approaches in the social and health
sciences has been rather slow, and research using ML for social and health
research questions remains fragmented. This may be due to the separate
development of research in the computational/data versus social and health
sciences as well as a lack of accessible overviews and adequate training in ML
techniques for non data science researchers. This paper provides a meta-mapping
of research questions in the social and health sciences to appropriate ML
approaches, by incorporating the necessary requirements to statistical analysis
in these disciplines. We map the established classification into description,
prediction, and causal inference to common research goals, such as estimating
prevalence of adverse health or social outcomes, predicting the risk of an
event, and identifying risk factors or causes of adverse outcomes. This
meta-mapping aims at overcoming disciplinary barriers and starting a fluid
dialogue between researchers from the social and health sciences and
methodologically trained researchers. Such mapping may also help to fully
exploit the benefits of ML while considering domain-specific aspects relevant
to the social and health sciences, and hopefully contribute to the acceleration
of the uptake of ML applications to advance both basic and applied social and
health sciences research.</span>

collaborative training across multiple parties while ensuring data privacy.
Practical adaptation of XGBoost, the state-of-the-art tree boosting framework,
to federated learning remains limited due to high cost incurred by conventional
privacy-preserving methods. To address the problem, we propose two variants of
federated XGBoost with privacy guarantee: FedXGBoost-SMM and FedXGBoost-LDP.
Our first protocol FedXGBoost-SMM deploys enhanced secure matrix multiplication
method to preserve privacy with lossless accuracy and lower overhead than
encryption-based techniques. Developed independently, the second protocol
FedXGBoost-LDP is heuristically designed with noise perturbation for local
differential privacy, and empirically evaluated on real-world and synthetic
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Existing computer vision research in categorization struggles with
fine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class
variances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by
locating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the
complete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its
strong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image
classification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without
requiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention
mechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the
model&#x27;s capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting
with four popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars,
Stanford Dogs, and FGVC7 Plant Pathology. We also prove our model&#x27;s
interpretability via qualitative results.</span>

visual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between
software applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical
glitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main
component of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game
development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently
occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of
graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing
techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test
sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These
techniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such
as bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in
automating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich
applications. Specifically, we propose \texttt{GLIB} based on a code-based data
augmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of
\texttt{GLIB} on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the
result shows that \texttt{GLIB} can achieve 100\% precision and 99.5\% recall
in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application
of \texttt{GLIB} on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further
demonstrates that \texttt{GLIB} can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48
of 53 bugs reported by \texttt{GLIB} having been confirmed and fixed so far.</span>

problem, both in the switching case and in the dynamic case. In the general
case where (a) the reward function is non-linear, (b) arms may be
probabilistically triggered, and (c) only approximate offline oracle exists
\cite{wang2017improving}, our algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S} T})$ distribution-dependent regret in
the switching case, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathcal{V}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ in the
dynamic case, where $\mathcal S$ is the number of switchings and $\mathcal V$
is the sum of the total &#x60;&#x60;distribution changes&#x27;&#x27;. The regret bounds in both
scenarios are nearly optimal, but our algorithm needs to know the parameter
$\mathcal S$ or $\mathcal V$ in advance.

We further show that by employing another technique, our algorithm no longer
needs to know the parameters $\mathcal S$ or $\mathcal V$ but the regret bounds
could become suboptimal.

In a special case where the reward function is linear and we have an exact
oracle, we design a parameter-free algorithm that achieves nearly optimal
regret both in the switching case and in the dynamic case without knowing the
parameters in advance.</span>

                                        <span>Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character
recognition (OCR) results into plain texts and then utilized token-level entity
annotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it
expends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, and the
OCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper,
we propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,
Copy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to
simultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)
a weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information
sequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which
contains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key
information sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input
or predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly
tag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new
state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves
its effectiveness.</span>

aims to optimize the policy solely from the data without further environment
interactions. In offline RL, the distributional shift becomes the primary
source of difficulty, which arises from the deviation of the target policy
being optimized from the behavior policy used for data collection. This
typically causes overestimation of action values, which poses severe problems
for model-free algorithms that use bootstrapping. To mitigate the problem,
prior offline RL algorithms often used sophisticated techniques that encourage
underestimation of action values, which introduces an additional set of
hyperparameters that need to be tuned properly. In this paper, we present an
offline RL algorithm that prevents overestimation in a more principled way. Our
algorithm, OptiDICE, directly estimates the stationary distribution corrections
of the optimal policy and does not rely on policy-gradients, unlike previous
offline RL algorithms. Using an extensive set of benchmark datasets for offline
RL, we show that OptiDICE performs competitively with the state-of-the-art

influencing our life path on a daily basis. Inference of personality traits,
such as Myers-Briggs Personality Type, as well as an understanding of
dependencies between personality traits and users&#x27; behavior on various social
media platforms is of crucial importance to modern research and industry
applications. The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues
makes it possible to perform user personality profiling automatically and
efficiently based on data represented across multiple data modalities. However,
the research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal
social media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different
social network data on machine learning performance has yet to be
comprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, there is not such dataset in the
research community to benchmark. This study is one of the first attempts
towards bridging such an important research gap. Specifically, in this work, we
infer the Myers-Briggs Personality Type indicators, by applying a novel
multi-view fusion framework, called &quot;PERS&quot; and comparing the performance
results not just across data modalities but also with respect to different
social network data sources. Our experimental results demonstrate the PERS&#x27;s
ability to learn from multi-view data for personality profiling by efficiently
leveraging on the significantly different data arriving from diverse social
multimedia sources. We have also found that the selection of a machine learning
approach is of crucial importance when choosing social network data sources and
that people tend to reveal multiple facets of their personality in different
social media avenues. Our released social multimedia dataset facilitates future
research on this direction.</span>

learning and statistics for dependent discrete event data. To date, most
existing models assume stationary kernels (including the classical Hawkes
processes) and simple parametric models. Modern applications with complex event
data require more general point process models that can incorporate contextual
information of the events, called marks, besides the temporal and location

capture more complex spatio-temporal dependence. To tackle these challenges, a
key question is to devise a versatile influence kernel in the point process
model. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general neural network-based
non-stationary influence kernel with high expressiveness for handling complex

                                        <span>We develop a learning-based control algorithm for unknown dynamical systems
under very severe data limitations. Specifically, the algorithm has access to
streaming data only from a single and ongoing trial. Despite the scarcity of
data, we show -- through a series of examples -- that the algorithm can provide
performance comparable to reinforcement learning algorithms trained over
millions of environment interactions. It accomplishes such performance by
effectively leveraging various forms of side information on the dynamics to
reduce the sample complexity. Such side information typically comes from
elementary laws of physics and qualitative properties of the system. More
precisely, the algorithm approximately solves an optimal control problem
encoding the system&#x27;s desired behavior. To this end, it constructs and refines
a differential inclusion that contains the unknown vector field of the
dynamics. The differential inclusion, used in an interval Taylor-based method,
enables to over-approximate the set of states the system may reach.
Theoretically, we establish a bound on the suboptimality of the approximate
solution with respect to the case of known dynamics. We show that the longer
the trial or the more side information is available, the tighter the bound.
Empirically, experiments in a high-fidelity F-16 aircraft simulator and
MuJoCo&#x27;s environments such as the Reacher, Swimmer, and Cheetah illustrate the
algorithm&#x27;s effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Ensembles of deep neural networks have achieved great success recently, but
they do not offer a proper Bayesian justification. Moreover, while they allow
for averaging of predictions over several hypotheses, they do not provide any
guarantees for their diversity, leading to redundant solutions in function
space. In contrast, particle-based inference methods, such as Stein variational
gradient descent (SVGD), offer a Bayesian framework, but rely on the choice of
a kernel to measure the similarity between ensemble members. In this work, we
study different SVGD methods operating in the weight space, function space, and
in a hybrid setting. % Defining the kernel directly on the neural network
functions seems promising to overcome the limitations of deep ensembles. %
However, ensuring diversity in function space while maintaining SVGD&#x27;s
theoretical guarantees is not trivial. % In this work, we provide an overview
over different ensembling and SVGD methods in weight space and function space
and propose new and assess their theoretical and empirical properties on
synthetic and real-world tasks. We compare the SVGD approaches to other
ensembling-based methods in terms of their theoretical properties and assess
their empirical performance on synthetic and real-world tasks. We find that
SVGD using functional and hybrid kernels can overcome the limitations of deep
ensembles. It improves on functional diversity and uncertainty estimation and
approaches the true Bayesian posterior more closely. Moreover, we show that
using stochastic SVGD updates, as opposed to the standard deterministic ones,
can further improve the performance.</span>

One example is the development of several algorithms that generate saliency
maps which show how much each pixel attributed to the agents&#x27; decision.
However, most evaluations of such saliency maps focus on image classification
tasks. As far as we know, there is no work that thoroughly compares different
saliency maps for Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. This paper compares four
perturbation-based approaches to create saliency maps for Deep Reinforcement
Learning agents trained on four different Atari 2600 games. All four approaches
work by perturbing parts of the input and measuring how much this affects the
agent&#x27;s output. The approaches are compared using three computational metrics:
dependence on the learned parameters of the agent (sanity checks), faithfulness
to the agent&#x27;s reasoning (input degradation), and run-time. In particular,
during the sanity checks we find issues with two approaches and propose a
solution to fix one of those issues.</span>

                                        <span>Tensor completion is the problem of estimating the missing values of
high-order data from partially observed entries. Among several definitions of
tensor rank, tensor ring rank affords the flexibility and accuracy needed to
model tensors of different orders, which motivated recent efforts on
tensor-ring completion. However, data corruption due to prevailing outliers
poses major challenges to existing algorithms. In this paper, we develop a
robust approach to tensor ring completion that uses an M-estimator as its error
statistic, which can significantly alleviate the effect of outliers. Leveraging
a half-quadratic (HQ) method, we reformulate the problem as one of weighted
tensor completion. We present two HQ-based algorithms based on truncated
singular value decomposition and matrix factorization along with their
convergence and complexity analysis. Extendibility of the proposed approach to
alternative definitions of tensor rank is also discussed. The experimental
results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over
state-of-the-art robust algorithms for tensor completion.</span>

Curation of images and animal identities. This is an open world recognition
problem, where most new animals enter the system after its algorithms are
initially trained and deployed. Continual Curation, as defined here, requires
(1) an improvement in the effectiveness of current recognition methods, (2) a
pairwise verification algorithm that allows the possibility of no decision, and
(3) an algorithmic decision mechanism that seeks human input to guide the
curation process. Error metrics must evaluate the ability of recognition
algorithms to identify not only animals that have been seen just once or twice
but also recognize new animals not in the database. An important measure of
overall system performance is accuracy as a function of the amount of human
input required.</span>

wavefunctions that has recently become more powerful due to the introduction of
neural network-based wavefunction parametrizations. However, efficiently
training neural wavefunctions to converge to an energy minimum remains a
difficult problem. In this work, we analyze optimization and sampling methods
used in VMC and introduce alterations to improve their performance. First,
based on theoretical convergence analysis in a noiseless setting, we motivate a
new optimizer that we call the Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton method, which can improve
upon gradient descent and natural gradient descent to achieve superlinear
convergence. Second, in order to realize this favorable comparison in the
presence of stochastic noise, we analyze the effect of sampling error on VMC
parameter updates and experimentally demonstrate that it can be reduced by the
parallel tempering method. In particular, we demonstrate that RGN can be made
robust to energy spikes that occur when new regions of configuration space
become available to the sampler over the course of optimization. Finally,
putting theory into practice, we apply our enhanced optimization and sampling
methods to the transverse-field Ising and XXZ models on large lattices,
yielding ground-state energy estimates with remarkably high accuracy after just
200-500 parameter updates.</span>

task-dependent semantic information which is encoded in heterogeneous
information networks (HINs). Specifically, we search for a meta graph, which
can capture more complex semantic relations than a meta path, to determine how
graph neural networks (GNNs) propagate messages along different types of edges.
We formalize the problem within the framework of neural architecture search
(NAS) and then perform the search in a differentiable manner. We design an
expressive search space in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
represent candidate meta graphs for a HIN, and we propose task-dependent type
constraint to filter out those edge types along which message passing has no
effect on the representations of nodes that are related to the downstream task.
The size of the search space we define is huge, so we further propose a novel
and efficient search algorithm to make the total search cost on a par with
training a single GNN once. Compared with existing popular NAS algorithms, our
proposed search algorithm improves the search efficiency. We conduct extensive
experiments on different HINs and downstream tasks to evaluate our method, and
experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art
heterogeneous GNNs and also improves efficiency compared with those methods
which can implicitly learn meta paths.</span>

Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge. The generative learning task can be formulated as
interpolating between a reference distribution and a target distribution based
on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. At the population level, this entropy
interpolation is characterized via an SDE on $[0,1]$ with a time-varying drift
term. At the sample level, we derive our Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge algorithm by
plugging the drift term estimated by a deep score estimator and a deep density
ratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method. Under some mild smoothness
assumptions of the target distribution, we prove the consistency of both the
score estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then establish the
consistency of the proposed Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical
results guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to
the target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and
benchmark data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the
generative model via Schr\&quot;{o}dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art
GANs, suggesting a new formulation of generative learning. We demonstrate its

latent space, i.e., it is intrinsically of low-dimension. The original data is
assumed to be mapped from a low-dimensional space through a
low-to-high-dimensional generator. In this work, we propound how to design such
a low-to-high dimensional deep learning-based generator suiting for compressed
sensing, while satisfying robustness to universal adversarial perturbations in
the latent domain. We also justify why the noise is considered in the latent
space. The work is also buttressed with theoretical analysis on the robustness
of the trained generator to adversarial perturbations. Experiments on
real-world datasets are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed
\emph{generative model adversarial training for deep compressed sensing.}</span>

                                        <span>In supervised learning, it is known that overparameterized neural networks
with one hidden layer provably and efficiently learn and generalize, when
trained using stochastic gradient descent with sufficiently small learning rate
and suitable initialization. In contrast, the benefit of overparameterization
in unsupervised learning is not well understood. Normalizing flows (NFs)
constitute an important class of models in unsupervised learning for sampling
and density estimation. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze
these models when the underlying neural network is one-hidden-layer
overparameterized network. Our main contributions are two-fold: (1) On the one
hand, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that for a class of NFs
containing most of the existing NF models, overparametrization hurts training.
(2) On the other hand, we prove that unconstrained NFs, a recently introduced
model, can efficiently learn any reasonable data distribution under minimal
assumptions when the underlying network is overparametrized.</span>

anxiety disorders. It has been documented that there are significant
differences in the language used by a person with emotional disorders in
comparison to a healthy individual. Still, the effectiveness of these lexical
approaches could be improved further because the current analysis focuses on
what the social media entries are about, and not how they are written. In this
study, we focus on aspects in which these short texts are similar to each
other, and how they were created. We present an innovative approach to the
depression screening problem by applying Collgram analysis, which is a known
effective method of obtaining linguistic information from texts. We compare
these results with sentiment analysis based on the BERT architecture. Finally,
we create a hybrid model achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 71%.</span>

disadvantages that the episodic meta-training brought, we adopt non-episodic
meta-training based on self-supervised learning. Overall we solve the few-shot
tasks in two phases: meta-training a transferable feature extractor via
self-supervised learning and training the prototypes for metric classification.
In addition, the simple attention mechanism is used in both meta-training and

                                        <span>Popular approaches for minimizing loss in data-driven learning often involve
an abstraction or an explicit retention of the history of gradients for
efficient parameter updates. The aggregated history of gradients nudges the
parameter updates in the right direction even when the gradients at any given
step are not informative. Although the history of gradients summarized in
meta-parameters or explicitly stored in memory has been shown effective in
theory and practice, the question of whether $all$ or only a subset of the
gradients in the history are sufficient in deciding the parameter updates
remains unanswered. In this paper, we propose a framework of memory-augmented
gradient descent optimizers that retain a limited view of their gradient
history in their internal memory. Such optimizers scale well to large real-life
datasets, and our experiments show that the memory augmented extensions of
standard optimizers enjoy accelerated convergence and improved performance on a
majority of computer vision and language tasks that we considered.
Additionally, we prove that the proposed class of optimizers with fixed-size
memory converge under assumptions of strong convexity, regardless of which
gradients are selected or how they are linearly combined to form the update
step.</span>

supernodes, respecting the structure of the tree decomposition, and following

difficulties in obtaining reliable policies from intelligent agents, especially
in large or continuous state/action spaces where limited scalability enforces
the use of a prohibitively large number of testing iterations. On the other
hand, a biased or inaccurate policy evaluation in a safety-critical system
could potentially cause unexpected catastrophic failures during deployment. In
this paper, we propose the Accelerated Policy Evaluation (APE) method, which
simultaneously uncovers rare events and estimates the rare event probability in
Markov decision processes. The APE method treats the environment nature as an
adversarial agent and learns towards, through adaptive importance sampling, the
zero-variance sampling distribution for the policy evaluation. Moreover, APE is
scalable to large discrete or continuous spaces by incorporating function
approximators. We investigate the convergence properties of proposed algorithms
under suitable regularity conditions. Our empirical studies show that APE
estimates rare event probability with a smaller variance while only using
orders of magnitude fewer samples compared to baseline methods in both
multi-agent and single-agent environments.</span>

                                        <span>Deep visual models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations to inputs.
Although these signals are carefully crafted, they still appear noise-like
patterns to humans. This observation has led to the argument that deep visual
representation is misaligned with human perception. We counter-argue by
providing evidence of human-meaningful patterns in adversarial perturbations.
We first propose an attack that fools a network to confuse a whole category of
objects (source class) with a target label. Our attack also limits the
unintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing
human-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed
attack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the
perturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision
boundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the
&#x60;adversarial&#x27; objective of our attack to use it as a tool to &#x60;explain&#x27; deep
visual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the
perturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model&#x27;s understanding
of human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability
properties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and
interactive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust
&#x60;classifiers&#x27;.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial
attack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual
models. The article also makes secondary contributions in terms of establishing
the utility of our attack beyond the adversarial objective with multiple
interesting applications.</span>

                                        <span>Massive access is a critical design challenge of Internet of Things (IoT)
networks. In this paper, we consider the grant-free uplink transmission of an
IoT network with a multiple-antenna base station (BS) and a large number of
single-antenna IoT devices. Taking into account the sporadic nature of IoT
devices, we formulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation
(JADCE) problem as a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. This problem can
be solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however
either suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm
robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based
on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational
complexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we
map the original iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into an
unrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence rate
and computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the
proposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain
knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can
handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous
theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by
reducing the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the
simplified unrolled deep neural network structures enjoy a linear convergence
rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble signatures show that the
proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of the
convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy.</span>

prosumers emerge. Due to the uncertainty of solar power generation, there is a
need for aggregated prosumers to predict solar power generation and whether
solar power generation will be larger than load. This paper presents two
interpretable neural networks to solve the problem: one binary classification
neural network and one regression neural network. The neural networks are built
using TensorFlow. The global feature importance and local feature contributions
are examined by three gradient-based methods: Integrated Gradients, Expected
Gradients, and DeepLIFT. Moreover, we detect abnormal cases when predictions
might fail by estimating the prediction uncertainty using Bayesian neural
networks. Neural networks, which are interpreted by gradient-based methods and
complemented with uncertainty estimation, provide robust and explainable
forecasting for decision-makers.</span>

with recorded offline experience without online exploration. Current offline RL
research includes: 1) generative modeling, i.e., approximating a policy using
fixed data; and 2) learning the state-action value function. While most
research focuses on the state-action function part through reducing the
bootstrapping error in value function approximation induced by the distribution
shift of training data, the effects of error propagation in generative modeling
have been neglected. In this paper, we analyze the error in generative
modeling. We propose AQL (action-conditioned Q-learning), a residual generative
model to reduce policy approximation error for offline RL. We show that our
method can learn more accurate policy approximations in different benchmark
datasets. In addition, we show that the proposed offline RL method can learn
more competitive AI agents in complex control tasks under the multiplayer

optimized end-to-end with gradient descent. However, the resampling step in a
particle filter is not differentiable, which biases gradients and interferes
with optimization. To remedy this problem, several differentiable variants of
resampling have been proposed, all of which modify the behavior of the particle
filter in significant and potentially undesirable ways. In this paper, we show
how to obtain unbiased estimators of the gradient of the marginal likelihood by
only modifying messages used in backpropagation, leaving the standard forward
pass of a particle filter unchanged. Our method is simple to implement, has a
low computational overhead, does not introduce additional hyperparameters, and
extends to derivatives of higher orders. We call it stop-gradient resampling,
since it can easily be implemented with automatic differentiation libraries
using the stop-gradient operator instead of explicitly modifying the backward
messages.</span>

interest due to the explosion in the amount of data in online applications. A
particular attention has been paid to collaborative filtering, which is the
most widely used in applications that involve information recommendations.
Collaborative filtering (CF) uses the known preference of a group of users to
make predictions and recommendations about the unknown preferences of other
users (recommendations are made based on the past behavior of users). First
introduced in the 1990s, a wide variety of increasingly successful models have
been proposed. Due to the success of machine learning techniques in many areas,
there has been a growing emphasis on the application of such algorithms in
recommendation systems. In this article, we present an overview of the CF
approaches for recommender systems, their two main categories, and their
evaluation metrics. We focus on the application of classical Machine Learning
algorithms to CF recommender systems by presenting their evolution from their
first use-cases to advanced Machine Learning models. We attempt to provide a
comprehensive and comparative overview of CF systems (with python
implementations) that can serve as a guideline for research and practice in
this area.</span>

examples to complement the testing set for generalization performance
evaluation of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we propose a practical
framework ContRE (The word &quot;contre&quot; means &quot;against&quot; or &quot;versus&quot; in French.)
that uses Contrastive examples for DNN geneRalization performance Estimation.
Specifically, ContRE follows the assumption in contrastive learning that robust
DNN models with good generalization performance are capable of extracting a
consistent set of features and making consistent predictions from the same
image under varying data transformations. Incorporating with a set of
randomized strategies for well-designed data transformations over the training
set, ContRE adopts classification errors and Fisher ratios on the generated
contrastive examples to assess and analyze the generalization performance of
deep models in complement with a testing set. To show the effectiveness and the
efficiency of ContRE, extensive experiments have been done using various DNN
models on three open source benchmark datasets with thorough ablation studies
and applicability analyses. Our experiment results confirm that (1) behaviors
of deep models on contrastive examples are strongly correlated to what on the
testing set, and (2) ContRE is a robust measure of generalization performance
complementing to the testing set in various settings.</span>

significant progress recently, enabling practical end-to-end training of neural
networks together with many hyperparameters. Nevertheless, existing approaches
are relatively expensive as they need to compute second-order derivatives and
store a longer computational graph. This cost prevents scaling them to larger
network architectures. We present EvoGrad, a new approach to meta-learning that
draws upon evolutionary techniques to more efficiently compute hypergradients.
EvoGrad estimates hypergradient with respect to hyperparameters without
calculating second-order gradients, or storing a longer computational graph,
leading to significant improvements in efficiency. We evaluate EvoGrad on two
substantial recent meta-learning applications, namely cross-domain few-shot
learning with feature-wise transformations and noisy label learning with
MetaWeightNet. The results show that EvoGrad significantly improves efficiency
and enables scaling meta-learning to bigger CNN architectures such as from

learning, which presents significant challenges due to the curse of
dimensionality. This paper proposes a joint dimensionality reduction and
non-parametric density estimation framework, using a novel estimator that can
explicitly capture the underlying distribution of appropriate reduced-dimension
representations of the input data. The idea is to jointly design a nonlinear
dimensionality reducing auto-encoder to model the training data in terms of a
parsimonious set of latent random variables, and learn a canonical low-rank
tensor model of the joint distribution of the latent variables in the Fourier
domain. The proposed latent density model is non-parametric and universal, as
opposed to the predefined prior that is assumed in variational auto-encoders.
Joint optimization of the auto-encoder and the latent density estimator is
pursued via a formulation which learns both by minimizing a combination of the
negative log-likelihood in the latent domain and the auto-encoder
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves very
promising results on toy, tabular, and image datasets on regression tasks,
sampling, and anomaly detection.</span>

regression and forecasting, as an alternative to the typical approach of
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for a specific target metric. This approach
is better suited to capture inductive biases such as prior domain knowledge in
datasets, and can output post-hoc estimators at inference time that can
optimize different types of target metrics. We present theoretical results to
demonstrate that our approach is always competitive with any estimator for the
target metric under some general conditions, and in many practical settings
(such as Poisson Regression) can actually be much superior to ERM. We
demonstrate empirically that our method instantiated with a well-designed
general purpose mixture likelihood family can obtain superior performance over
ERM for a variety of tasks across time-series forecasting and regression
datasets with different data distributions.</span>

programming and control, the problem can also be approached using probabilistic
inference. The algorithms that emerge using the latter framework bear some
appealing characteristics that qualify the probabilistic approach as a powerful
alternative to the more traditional control formulations. The idea of using
estimation on stochastic models to solve control problems is not new and the
inference approach considered here falls under the rubric of Active Inference
(AI) and Control as Inference (CAI). In this work, we look at the specific
recursions that arise from various cost functions that, although they may
appear similar in scope, bear noticeable differences, at least when applied to
typical path planning problems. We start by posing the path planning problem on
a probabilistic factor graph, and show how the various algorithms translate
into specific message composition rules. We then show how this unified
approach, presented both in probability space and in log space, provides a very
general framework that includes the Sum-product, the Max-product, Dynamic
programming and mixed Reward/Entropy criteria-based algorithms. The framework
also expands algorithmic design options for smoother or sharper policy
distributions, including generalized Sum/Max-product algorithm, a Smooth
Dynamic programming algorithm and modified versions of the Reward/Entropy
recursions. We provide a comprehensive table of recursions and a comparison
through simulations, first on a synthetic small grid with a single goal with
obstacles, and then on a grid extrapolated from a real-world scene with
multiple goals and a semantic map.</span>

                                        <span>Blindly decoding a signal requires estimating its unknown transmit
parameters, compensating for the wireless channel impairments, and identifying
the modulation type. While deep learning can solve complex problems, digital
signal processing (DSP) is interpretable and can be more computationally
efficient. To combine both, we propose the dual path network (DPN). It consists
of a signal path of DSP operations that recover the signal, and a feature path
of neural networks that estimate the unknown transmit parameters. By
interconnecting the paths over several recovery stages, later stages benefit
from the recovered signals and reuse all the previously extracted features. The
proposed design is demonstrated to provide 5% improvement in modulation
classification compared to alternative designs lacking either feature sharing
or access to recovered signals. The estimation results of DPN along with its
blind decoding performance are shown to outperform a blind signal processing
algorithm for BPSK and QPSK on a simulated dataset. An over-the-air
software-defined-radio capture was used to verify DPN results at high SNRs. DPN
design can process variable length inputs and is shown to outperform relying on
fixed length inputs with prediction averaging on longer signals by up to 15% in
modulation classification.</span>

learning (RL) to overcome the limitation of the maximum entropy RL framework in
model-free sample-based learning. Whereas the maximum entropy RL framework
guides learning for policies to reach states with high entropy in the future,
the proposed max-min entropy framework aims to learn to visit states with low
entropy and maximize the entropy of these low-entropy states to promote
exploration. For general Markov decision processes (MDPs), an efficient
algorithm is constructed under the proposed max-min entropy framework based on
disentanglement of exploration and exploitation. Numerical results show that
the proposed algorithm yields drastic performance improvement over the current
state-of-the-art RL algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Super-resolution (SR) is a one-to-many task with multiple possible solutions.
However, previous works were not concerned about this characteristic. For a
one-to-many pipeline, the generator should be able to generate multiple
estimates of the reconstruction, and not be penalized for generating similar
and equally realistic images. To achieve this, we propose adding weighted
pixel-wise noise after every Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) to enable
the generator to generate various images. We modify the strict content loss to
not penalize the stochastic variation in reconstructed images as long as it has
consistent content. Additionally, we observe that there are out-of-focus
regions in the DIV2K, DIV8K datasets that provide unhelpful guidelines. We
filter blurry regions in the training data using the method of [10]. Finally,
we modify the discriminator to receive the low-resolution image as a reference
image along with the target image to provide better feedback to the generator.
Using our proposed methods, we were able to improve the performance of ESRGAN
in x4 perceptual SR and achieve the state-of-the-art LPIPS score in x16
perceptual extreme SR.</span>

                                        <span>Predicting multiple heterogeneous biological and medical targets is a
challenge for traditional deep learning models. In contrast to single-task
learning, in which a separate model is trained for each target, multi-task
learning (MTL) optimizes a single model to predict multiple related targets
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-gate
Mixture-of-Experts with Exclusivity (MMoEEx). Our work aims to tackle the
heterogeneous MTL setting, in which the same model optimizes multiple tasks
with different characteristics. Such a scenario can overwhelm current MTL
approaches due to the challenges in balancing shared and task-specific
representations and the need to optimize tasks with competing optimization
paths. Our method makes two key contributions: first, we introduce an approach
to induce more diversity among experts, thus creating representations more
suitable for highly imbalanced and heterogenous MTL learning; second, we adopt
a two-step optimization [6, 11] approach to balancing the tasks at the gradient
level. We validate our method on three MTL benchmark datasets, including
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and PubChem BioAssay
(PCBA).</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) refers to the paradigm where multiple worker nodes
(WNs) build a joint model by using local data. Despite extensive research, for
a generic non-convex FL problem, it is not clear, how to choose the WNs&#x27; and
the server&#x27;s update directions, the minibatch sizes, and the local update
frequency, so that the WNs use the minimum number of samples and communication
rounds to achieve the desired solution. This work addresses the above question
and considers a class of stochastic algorithms where the WNs perform a few
local updates before communication. We show that when both the WN&#x27;s and the
server&#x27;s directions are chosen based on a stochastic momentum estimator, the
algorithm requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ samples and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication rounds to compute an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
FL algorithm that achieves such {\it near-optimal} sample and communication
complexities simultaneously. Further, we show that there is a trade-off curve
between local update frequencies and local minibatch sizes, on which the above
sample and communication complexities can be maintained. Finally, we show that
for the classical FedAvg (a.k.a. Local SGD, which is a momentum-less special
case of the STEM), a similar trade-off curve exists, albeit with worse sample
and communication complexities. Our insights on this trade-off provides
guidelines for choosing the four important design elements for FL algorithms,
the update frequency, directions, and minibatch sizes to achieve the best
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to
predict how good the performance is when transfer a source model (source task)
to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been widely
used for source model selection and multi-task learning. Earlier metrics does
not work sufficiently well under the challenging cross-domain cross-task
transfer settings, but recent OTCE score achieves a noteworthy performance
using auxiliary tasks. A simplified version named OT-based NCE score sacrifices
accuracy to be more efficient, but it can be further improved. Consequently, we
propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score to further
improve the cross-domain cross-task transferability estimation performance,
which is more efficient than the OTCE score and more accurate than the OT-based
NCE score. Specifically, we build the joint correspondences between source and
target data via solving an optimal transport problem with considering both the
sample distance and label distance, and then compute the transferability score
as the negative conditional entropy. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the OT-based NCE score with about 7% and 12% gains,
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Existing observational approaches for learning human preferences, such as
inverse reinforcement learning, usually make strong assumptions about the
observability of the human&#x27;s environment. However, in reality, people make many
important decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning
in these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a
previously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential
binary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human&#x27;s preferences are
conveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between
different types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT,
providing conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing
the sample complexity -- the number of decisions that must be observed to learn
the tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show
that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is
more uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the
unrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still
identify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this
suboptimal case as well. Our analysis contradicts the intuition that partial
observability should make preference learning more difficult. It also provides
a first step towards understanding and improving preference learning methods
for uncertain and suboptimal humans.</span>

                                        <span>Meta-learning (ML) has emerged as a promising direction in learning models
under constrained resource settings like few-shot learning. The popular
approaches for ML either learn a generalizable initial model or a generic
parametric optimizer through episodic training. The former approaches leverage
the knowledge from a batch of tasks to learn an optimal prior. In this work, we
study the importance of a batch for ML. Specifically, we first incorporate a
batch episodic training regimen to improve the learning of the generic
parametric optimizer. We also hypothesize that the common assumption in batch
episodic training that each task in a batch has an equal contribution to
learning an optimal meta-model need not be true. We propose to weight the tasks
in a batch according to their &quot;importance&quot; in improving the meta-model&#x27;s
learning. To this end, we introduce a training curriculum motivated by
selective focus in humans, called task attended meta-training, to weight the
tasks in a batch. Task attention is a standalone module that can be integrated
with any batch episodic training regimen. The comparisons of the models with
their non-task-attended counterparts on complex datasets like miniImageNet and
tieredImageNet validate its effectiveness.</span>

playing far different roles in structure and function and edges representing
the relationships between nodes. Identifying critical nodes can help us control
the spread of public opinions or epidemics, predict leading figures in
academia, conduct advertisements for various commodities, and so on. However,
it is rather difficult to identify critical nodes because the network structure
changes over time in temporal networks. In this paper, considering the sequence
topological information of temporal networks, a novel and effective learning
framework based on the combination of special GCNs and RNNs is proposed to
identify nodes with the best spreading ability. The effectiveness of the
approach is evaluated by weighted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.
Experimental results on four real-world temporal networks demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning benchmark
methods in terms of the Kendall $\tau$ coefficient and top $k$ hit rate.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation is widely used as a means of improving the performance
of a relatively simple student model using the predictions from a complex
teacher model. Several works have shown that distillation significantly boosts
the student&#x27;s overall performance; however, are these gains uniform across all
data subgroups? In this paper, we show that distillation can harm performance
on certain subgroups, e.g., classes with few associated samples. We trace this
behaviour to errors made by the teacher distribution being transferred to and
amplified by the student model. To mitigate this problem, we present techniques
which soften the teacher influence for subgroups where it is less reliable.
Experiments on several image classification benchmarks show that these
modifications of distillation maintain boost in overall accuracy, while
additionally ensuring improvement in subgroup performance.</span>

learn representations from network data. A key property of GCNNs is their
stability to graph perturbations. Current analysis considers deterministic
perturbations but fails to provide relevant insights when topological changes
are random. This paper investigates the stability of GCNNs to stochastic graph
perturbations induced by link losses. In particular, it proves the expected
output difference between the GCNN over random perturbed graphs and the GCNN
over the nominal graph is upper bounded by a factor that is linear in the link
loss probability. We perform the stability analysis in the graph spectral
domain such that the result holds uniformly for any graph. This result also
shows the role of the nonlinearity and the architecture width and depth, and
allows identifying handle to improve the GCNN robustness. Numerical simulations
on source localization and robot swarm control corroborate our theoretical
findings.</span>

predictions from historical data (e.g., an optimizer that aims to recommend
fast routes relies upon travel-time predictions). Typically, learning the
prediction model used to generate the optimization problem and solving that
problem are performed in two separate stages. Recent work has showed how such
prediction models can be learned end-to-end by differentiating through the
optimization task. Such methods often yield empirical improvements, which are
typically attributed to end-to-end making better error tradeoffs than the
standard loss function used in a two-stage solution. We refine this explanation
and more precisely characterize when end-to-end can improve performance. When
prediction targets are stochastic, a two-stage solution must make an a priori
choice about which statistics of the target distribution to model -- we
consider expectations over prediction targets -- while an end-to-end solution
can make this choice adaptively. We show that the performance gap between a
two-stage and end-to-end approach is closely related to the \emph{price of
correlation} concept in stochastic optimization and show the implications of
some existing POC results for our predict-then-optimize problem. We then
consider a novel and particularly practical setting, where coefficients in the
objective function depend on multiple prediction targets. We give explicit
constructions where (1) two-stage performs unboundedly worse than end-to-end;
and (2) two-stage is optimal. We identify a large set of real-world
applications whose objective functions rely on multiple prediction targets but
which nevertheless deploy two-stage solutions. We also use simulations to
experimentally quantify performance gaps.</span>

                                        <span>Path planning, the problem of efficiently discovering high-reward
trajectories, often requires optimizing a high-dimensional and multimodal
reward function. Popular approaches like CEM and CMA-ES greedily focus on
promising regions of the search space and may get trapped in local maxima. DOO
and VOOT balance exploration and exploitation, but use space partitioning
strategies independent of the reward function to be optimized. Recently, LaMCTS
empirically learns to partition the search space in a reward-sensitive manner
for black-box optimization. In this paper, we develop a novel formal regret
analysis for when and why such an adaptive region partitioning scheme works. We
also propose a new path planning method PlaLaM which improves the function
value estimation within each sub-region, and uses a latent representation of
the search space. Empirically, PlaLaM outperforms existing path planning
methods in 2D navigation tasks, especially in the presence of
difficult-to-escape local optima, and shows benefits when plugged into
model-based RL with planning components such as PETS. These gains transfer to
highly multimodal real-world tasks, where we outperform strong baselines in
compiler phase ordering by up to 245% and in molecular design by up to 0.4 on
properties on a 0-1 scale.</span>

resources into the power grids. To address the scalability and adaptivity

attaining reduced model complexity and fast adaptivity to varying grid

Machine Learning approach to the prediction of FG direction. Conducted data
analysis reveals the inherent complexity of the problem and explains the
reasons of difficulty in FG direction prediction based on 2D X-ray images. To
perform growth forecasting, we employ a wide range of algorithms, from logistic
regression, through tree ensembles to neural networks and consider three,

timestamp-level representations of time series. Unlike existing methods, TS2Vec
performs timestamp-wise discrimination, which learns a contextual
representation vector directly for each timestamp. We find that the learned
representations have superior predictive ability. A linear regression trained
on top of the learned representations outperforms previous SOTAs for supervised
time series forecasting. Also, the instance-level representations can be simply
obtained by applying a max pooling layer on top of learned representations of
all timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments on time series classification
tasks to evaluate the quality of instance-level representations. As a result,
TS2Vec achieves significant improvement compared with existing SOTAs of
unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets and 29 UEA
datasets. The source code is publicly available at

adjusting network weights for feature fitting. However, the spectral bias in
network training leads to unbearable training epochs for fitting the
high-frequency components in broadband signals. To improve the fitting
efficiency of high-frequency components, the PhaseDNN was proposed recently by
combining complex frequency band extraction and frequency shift techniques [Cai
et al. SIAM J. SCI. COMPUT. 42, A3285 (2020)]. Our paper is devoted to an
alternative candidate for fitting complex signals with high-frequency
components. Here, a parallel frequency function-deep neural network (PFF-DNN)
is proposed to suppress computational overhead while ensuring fitting accuracy
by utilizing fast Fourier analysis of broadband signals and the spectral bias
nature of neural networks. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
PFF-DNN method are verified based on detailed numerical experiments for six
typical broadband signals.</span>

                                        <span>The utilization of computer technology to solve problems in medical scenarios
has attracted considerable attention in recent years, which still has great
potential and space for exploration. Among them, machine learning has been
widely used in the prediction, diagnosis and even treatment of Sepsis. However,
state-of-the-art methods require large amounts of labeled medical data for
supervised learning. In real-world applications, the lack of labeled data will
cause enormous obstacles if one hospital wants to deploy a new Sepsis detection
system. Different from the supervised learning setting, we need to use known
information (e.g., from another hospital with rich labeled data) to help build
a model with acceptable performance, i.e., transfer learning. In this paper, we
propose a semi-supervised optimal transport with self-paced ensemble framework
for Sepsis early detection, called SPSSOT, to transfer knowledge from the other
that has rich labeled data. In SPSSOT, we first extract the same clinical
indicators from the source domain (e.g., hospital with rich labeled data) and
the target domain (e.g., hospital with little labeled data), then we combine
the semi-supervised domain adaptation based on optimal transport theory with
self-paced under-sampling to avoid a negative transfer possibly caused by
covariate shift and class imbalance. On the whole, SPSSOT is an end-to-end
transfer learning method for Sepsis early detection which can automatically
select suitable samples from two domains respectively according to the number
of iterations and align feature space of two domains. Extensive experiments on
two open clinical datasets demonstrate that comparing with other methods, our
proposed SPSSOT, can significantly improve the AUC values with only 1% labeled
data in the target domain in two transfer learning scenarios, MIMIC
$rightarrow$ Challenge and Challenge $rightarrow$ MIMIC.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, live video streaming events have become a mainstay in viewer&#x27;s
communication in large international enterprises. Provided that viewers are
distributed worldwide, the main challenge resides on how to schedule the
optimal event&#x27;s time so as to improve both the viewer&#x27;s engagement and
adoption. In this paper we present a multi-task deep reinforcement learning
model to select the time of a live video streaming event, aiming to optimize
the viewer&#x27;s engagement and adoption at the same time. We consider the
engagement and adoption of the viewers as independent tasks and formulate a
unified loss function to learn a common policy. In addition, we account for the
fact that each task might have different contribution to the training strategy
of the agent. Therefore, to determine the contribution of each task to the
agent&#x27;s training, we design a Transformer&#x27;s architecture for the state-action
transitions of each task. We evaluate our proposed model on four real-world
datasets, generated by the live video streaming events of four large
enterprises spanning from January 2019 until March 2021. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model when compared with several
state-of-the-art strategies. For reproduction purposes, our evaluation datasets

the famous AlphaGo series. The main motivation behind OLIVAW was to attain
exceptional competence in a non-trivial board game at a tiny fraction of the
cost of its illustrious predecessors. In this paper, we show how the AlphaGo
Zero&#x27;s paradigm can be successfully applied to the popular game of Othello
using only commodity hardware and free cloud services. While being simpler than
Chess or Go, Othello maintains a considerable search space and difficulty in
evaluating board positions. To achieve this result, OLIVAW implements some
improvements inspired by recent works to accelerate the standard AlphaGo Zero
learning process. The main modification implies doubling the positions
collected per game during the training phase, by including also positions not
played but largely explored by the agent. We tested the strength of OLIVAW in
three different ways: by pitting it against Edax, the strongest open-source
Othello engine, by playing anonymous games on the web platform OthelloQuest,
and finally in two in-person matches against top-notch human players: a
national champion and a former world champion.</span>

object recognition. However, the most powerful object recognition methods today
do not explicitly make use of object shape during learning. In this work,
motivated by recent developments in low-shot learning, findings in
developmental psychology, and the increased use of synthetic data in computer
vision research, we investigate how reasoning about 3D shape can be used to
improve low-shot learning methods&#x27; generalization performance. We propose a new
way to improve existing low-shot learning approaches by learning a
discriminative embedding space using 3D object shape, and using this embedding
by learning how to map images into it. Our new approach improves the
performance of image-only low-shot learning approaches on multiple datasets. We
also introduce Toys4K, a 3D object dataset with the largest number of object
categories currently available, which supports low-shot learning.</span>

the onset of the symptoms can prevent the rapid progression of the emerging
cognitive impairment. Recent progress has shown that Electroencephalography
(EEG) is the promising and cost-effective test to facilitate the detection of
neurocognitive disorders. However, most of the existing works have been using
only resting-state EEG. The efficiencies of EEG signals from various cognitive
tasks, for dementia classification, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this study, we designed four cognitive tasks that engage different cognitive
performances: attention, working memory, and executive function. We
investigated these tasks by using statistical analysis on both time and
frequency domains of EEG signals from three classes of human subjects: Dementia
(DEM), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Normal Control (NC). We also
further evaluated the classification performances of two features extraction
methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Filter Bank Common Spatial
Pattern (FBCSP). We found that the working memory related tasks yielded good
performances for dementia recognition in both cases using PCA and FBCSP.
Moreover, FBCSP with features combination from four tasks revealed the best
sensitivity of 0.87 and the specificity of 0.80. To our best knowledge, this is
the first work that concurrently investigated several cognitive tasks for
dementia recognition using both statistical analysis and classification scores.
Our results give essential information to design and aid in conducting further
experimental tasks to early diagnose dementia patients.</span>

previously acquired knowledge -- is a natural requirement for long-lived
autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) agents. While building such agents, one
needs to balance opposing desiderata, such as constraints on capacity and
compute, the ability to not catastrophically forget, and to exhibit positive
transfer on new tasks. Understanding the right trade-off is conceptually and
computationally challenging, which we argue has led the community to overly
focus on catastrophic forgetting. In response to these issues, we advocate for
the need to prioritize forward transfer and propose Continual World, a
benchmark consisting of realistic and meaningfully diverse robotic tasks built
on top of Meta-World as a testbed. Following an in-depth empirical evaluation
of existing CL methods, we pinpoint their limitations and highlight unique
algorithmic challenges in the RL setting. Our benchmark aims to provide a

                                        <span>Deep learning on graphs has recently achieved remarkable success on a variety
of tasks while such success relies heavily on the massive and carefully labeled
data. However, precise annotations are generally very expensive and
time-consuming. To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is
emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through
well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey,
we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer
vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive
review of the existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide
existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and
predictive. More importantly, unlike many other surveys that only provide a
high-level description of published research, we present an additional
mathematical summary of the existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore,
to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also
summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, and
open-source implementations of various algorithms. Finally, we discuss the
technical challenges and potential future directions for improving graph
self-supervised learning.</span>

                                        <span>Tuning complex machine learning systems is challenging. Machine learning
typically requires to set hyperparameters, be it regularization, architecture,
or optimization parameters, whose tuning is critical to achieve good predictive
performance. To democratize access to machine learning systems, it is essential
to automate the tuning. This paper presents Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model
Tuning (AMT), a fully managed system for gradient-free optimization at scale.
AMT finds the best version of a trained machine learning model by repeatedly
evaluating it with different hyperparameter configurations. It leverages either
random search or Bayesian optimization to choose the hyperparameter values
resulting in the best model, as measured by the metric chosen by the user. AMT
can be used with built-in algorithms, custom algorithms, and Amazon SageMaker
pre-built containers for machine learning frameworks. We discuss the core
functionality, system architecture, our design principles, and lessons learned.
We also describe more advanced features of AMT, such as automated early
stopping and warm-starting, showing in experiments their benefits to users.</span>

constituent music sources that a music clip is composed of. In this work, we
explore the single-channel singing voice separation problem from a multimodal
perspective, by jointly learning from audio and visual modalities. To do so, we
present Acappella, a dataset spanning around 46 hours of a cappella solo
singing videos sourced from YouTube. We propose Y-Net, an audio-visual
convolutional neural network which achieves state-of-the-art singing voice
separation results on the Acappella dataset and compare it against its
audio-only counterpart, U-Net, and a state-of-the-art audio-visual speech
separation model. Singing voice separation can be particularly challenging when
the audio mixture also comprises of other accompaniment voices and background
sounds along with the target voice of interest. We demonstrate that our model
can outperform the baseline models in the singing voice separation task in such
challenging scenarios. The code, the pre-trained models and the dataset will be

                                        <span>Biological neurons have adaptive nature and perform complex computations
involving the filtering of redundant information. However, most common neural
cell models, including biologically plausible, such as Hodgkin-Huxley or
Izhikevich, do not possess predictive dynamics on a single-cell level.
Moreover, the modern rules of synaptic plasticity or interconnections weights
adaptation also do not provide grounding for the ability of neurons to adapt to
the ever-changing input signal intensity. While natural neuron synaptic growth
is precisely controlled and restricted by protein supply and recycling, weight
correction rules such as widely used STDP are efficiently unlimited in change
rate and scale. The present article introduces new mechanics of interconnection
between neuron firing rate homeostasis and weight change through STDP growth
bounded by abstract protein reserve, controlled by the intracellular
optimization algorithm. We show how these cellular dynamics help neurons filter
out the intense noise signals to help neurons keep a stable firing rate. We
also examine that such filtering does not affect the ability of neurons to
recognize the correlated inputs in unsupervised mode. Such an approach might be
used in the machine learning domain to improve the robustness of AI systems.</span>

As mobile robots come to inhabit and traffic social spaces, they must account
for social cues and behave in a socially compliant manner. We focus on learning
such cues from examples. We describe an inverse reinforcement learning based
algorithm which learns from human trajectory observations without knowing their
specific actions. We increase the sample-efficiency of our approach over
alternative methods by leveraging the notion of a replay buffer (found in many
off-policy reinforcement learning methods) to eliminate the additional sample
complexity associated with inverse reinforcement learning. We evaluate our
method by training agents using publicly available pedestrian motion data sets
and compare it to related methods. We show that our approach yields better

                                        <span>Robust training methods against perturbations to the input data have received
great attention in the machine learning literature. A standard approach in this
direction is adversarial training which learns a model using
adversarially-perturbed training samples. However, adversarial training
performs suboptimally against perturbations structured across samples such as
universal and group-sparse shifts that are commonly present in biological data
such as gene expression levels of different tissues. In this work, we seek to
close this optimality gap and introduce Group-Structured Adversarial Training
(GSAT) which learns a model robust to perturbations structured across samples.
We formulate GSAT as a non-convex concave minimax optimization problem which
minimizes a group-structured optimal transport cost. Specifically, we focus on
the applications of GSAT for group-sparse and rank-constrained perturbations
modeled using group and nuclear norm penalties. In order to solve GSAT&#x27;s
non-smooth optimization problem in those cases, we propose a new minimax
optimization algorithm called GDADMM by combining Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)
and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We present several
applications of the GSAT framework to gain robustness against structured
perturbations for image recognition and computational biology datasets.</span>

few-shot classification problem where a diverse training set of several
datasets is given, for the purpose of training an adaptable model that can then
learn classes from new datasets using only a few examples. To this end, we
propose to utilize the diverse training set to construct a universal template:
a partial model that can define a wide array of dataset-specialized models, by
plugging in appropriate components. For each new few-shot classification
problem, our approach therefore only requires inferring a small number of
parameters to insert into the universal template. We design a separate network
that produces an initialization of those parameters for each given task, and we
then fine-tune its proposed initialization via a few steps of gradient descent.
Our approach is more parameter-efficient, scalable and adaptable compared to
previous methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art on the challenging
Meta-Dataset benchmark.</span>

At extremely low bit-rates, standard video coding schemes suffer from
unpleasant reconstruction artifacts such as blocking, ringing etc. Existing
learned neural approaches to video compression have achieved reasonable success
on reducing the bit-rate for efficient transmission and reduce the impact of
artifacts to an extent. However, they still tend to produce blurred results
under extreme compression. In this paper, we present a deep adversarial learned
video compression model that minimizes an auxiliary adversarial distortion
objective. We find this adversarial objective to correlate better with human
perceptual quality judgement relative to traditional quality metrics such as
MS-SSIM and PSNR. Our experiments using a state-of-the-art learned video

reconstruction of detail lost especially under extremely high compression.</span>

tasks. However, when trained on privacy-sensitive datasets, the model
parameters may expose private information in training data. Prior attempts for
differentially private training, although offering rigorous privacy guarantees,
lead to much lower model performance than the non-private ones. Besides,
different runs of the same training algorithm produce models with large
performance variance. To address these issues, we propose DPlis--Differentially
Private Learning wIth Smoothing. The core idea of DPlis is to construct a
smooth loss function that favors noise-resilient models lying in large flat
regions of the loss landscape. We provide theoretical justification for the
utility improvements of DPlis. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that
DPlis can effectively boost model quality and training stability under a given
privacy budget.</span>

For convex quadratic objectives, Chen et al. (2018) proved that the uniform
stability of the method grows quadratically with the number of optimization
steps, and conjectured that the same is true for the general convex and smooth
case. We disprove this conjecture and show, for two notions of algorithmic
stability (including uniform stability), that the stability of Nesterov&#x27;s
accelerated method in fact deteriorates exponentially fast with the number of
gradient steps. This stands in sharp contrast to the bounds in the quadratic

                                        <span>The interpretation of feature importance in machine learning models is
challenging when features are dependent. Permutation feature importance (PFI)
ignores such dependencies, which can cause misleading interpretations due to
extrapolation. A possible remedy is more advanced conditional PFI approaches
that enable the assessment of feature importance conditional on all other
features. Due to this shift in perspective and in order to enable correct
interpretations, it is therefore important that the conditioning is transparent
and humanly comprehensible. In this paper, we propose a new sampling mechanism
for the conditional distribution based on permutations in conditional
subgroups. As these subgroups are constructed using decision trees
(transformation trees), the conditioning becomes inherently interpretable. This
not only provides a simple and effective estimator of conditional PFI, but also
local PFI estimates within the subgroups. In addition, we apply the conditional
subgroups approach to partial dependence plots (PDP), a popular method for
describing feature effects that can also suffer from extrapolation when
features are dependent and interactions are present in the model. We show that
PFI and PDP based on conditional subgroups often outperform methods such as
conditional PFI based on knockoffs, or accumulated local effect plots.
Furthermore, our approach allows for a more fine-grained interpretation of
feature effects and importance within the conditional subgroups.</span>

                                        <span>Works on lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) and single-shot network pruning
(SNIP) have raised a lot of attention currently on post-training pruning
(iterative magnitude pruning), and before-training pruning (pruning at
initialization). The former method suffers from an extremely large computation
cost and the latter category of methods usually struggles with insufficient
performance. In comparison, during-training pruning, a class of pruning methods
that simultaneously enjoys the training/inference efficiency and the comparable
performance, temporarily, has been less explored. To better understand
during-training pruning, we quantitatively study the effect of pruning
throughout training from the perspective of pruning plasticity (the ability of
the pruned networks to recover the original performance). Pruning plasticity
can help explain several other empirical observations about neural network
pruning in literature. We further find that pruning plasticity can be
substantially improved by injecting a brain-inspired mechanism called
neuroregeneration, i.e., to regenerate the same number of connections as
pruned. Based on the insights from pruning plasticity, we design a novel
gradual magnitude pruning (GMP) method, named gradual pruning with zero-cost
neuroregeneration (GraNet), and its dynamic sparse training (DST) variant
(GraNet-ST). Both of them advance state of the art. Perhaps most impressively,
the latter for the first time boosts the sparse-to-sparse training performance
over various dense-to-sparse methods by a large margin with ResNet-50 on
ImageNet. We will release all codes.</span>

extractive or abstractive models. Social media brings a hurdle to summarization
techniques since it requires addressing a multi-document multi-author approach.
We address this challenging task by introducing a novel method that generates
abstractive summaries of online news discussions. Our method extends a
BERT-based architecture, including an attention encoding that fed comments&#x27;
likes during the training stage. To train our model, we define a task which
consists of reconstructing high impact comments based on popularity (likes).
Accordingly, our model learns to summarize online discussions based on their
most relevant comments. Our novel approach provides a summary that represents
the most relevant aspects of a news item that users comment on, incorporating
the social context as a source of information to summarize texts in online
social networks. Our model is evaluated using ROUGE scores between the
generated summary and each comment on the thread. Our model, including the
social attention encoding, significantly outperforms both extractive and
abstractive summarization methods based on such evaluation.</span>

exoskeleton-based action and movement recognition. First, it presents a novel
machine learning and pattern recognition-based framework that can detect a wide
range of actions and movements - walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs,
sitting, standing, lying, stand to sit, sit to stand, sit to lie, lie to sit,
stand to lie, and lie to stand, with an overall accuracy of 82.63%. Second, it
presents a comprehensive comparative study of different learning approaches -
Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Multiway Decision
Tree, Support Vector Machine, k-NN, Gradient Boosted Trees, Decision Stump,
Auto MLP, Linear Regression, Vector Linear Regression, Random Tree, Na\&quot;ive
Bayes, Na\&quot;ive Bayes (Kernel), Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis, and Deep Learning applied to this framework. The
performance of each of these learning approaches was boosted by using the
AdaBoost algorithm, and the Cross Validation approach was used for training and
testing. The results show that in boosted form, the k- NN classifier
outperforms all the other boosted learning approaches and is, therefore, the
optimal learning method for this purpose. The results presented and discussed
uphold the importance of this work to contribute towards augmenting the
abilities of exoskeleton-based assisted and independent living of the elderly
in the future of Internet of Things-based living environments, such as Smart

the dynamics of brain function gets affected even earlier. Subsequently,
spatio-temporal structure of disorder-specific dynamics is crucial for early
diagnosis and understanding the disorder mechanism. A common way of learning
discriminatory features relies on training a classifier and evaluating feature
importance. Classical classifiers, based on handcrafted features are quite
powerful, but suffer the curse of dimensionality when applied to large input
dimensions of spatio-temporal data. Deep learning algorithms could handle the
problem and a model introspection could highlight discriminatory
spatio-temporal regions but need way more samples to train. In this paper we
present a novel self supervised training schema which reinforces whole sequence
mutual information local to context (whole MILC). We pre-train the whole MILC
model on unlabeled and unrelated healthy control data. We test our model on
three different disorders (i) Schizophrenia (ii) Autism and (iii) Alzheimers
and four different studies. Our algorithm outperforms existing self-supervised
pre-training methods and provides competitive classification results to
classical machine learning algorithms. Importantly, whole MILC enables
attribution of subject diagnosis to specific spatio-temporal regions in the
fMRI signal.</span>

forecast for the next time steps without any human intervention. Gaussian
Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for modeling time series, but so far there
are no competitive approaches for automatic forecasting based on GPs. We
propose practical solutions to two problems: automatic selection of the optimal
kernel and reliable estimation of the hyperparameters. We propose a fixed
composition of kernels, which contains the components needed to model most time
series: linear trend, periodic patterns, and other flexible kernel for modeling
the non-linear trend. Not all components are necessary to model each time
series; during training the unnecessary components are automatically made
irrelevant via automatic relevance determination (ARD). We moreover assign
priors to the hyperparameters, in order to keep the inference within a
plausible range; we design such priors through an empirical Bayes approach. We
present results on many time series of different types; our GP model is more
accurate than state-of-the-art time series models. Thanks to the priors, a
single restart is enough the estimate the hyperparameters; hence the model is
also fast to train.</span>

with the real world. In practice, the unstructured step-based exploration used
in Deep RL -- often very successful in simulation -- leads to jerky motion
patterns on real robots. Consequences of the resulting shaky behavior are poor
exploration, or even damage to the robot. We address these issues by adapting
state-dependent exploration (SDE) to current Deep RL algorithms. To enable this
adaptation, we propose two extensions to the original SDE, using more general
features and re-sampling the noise periodically, which leads to a new
exploration method generalized state-dependent exploration (gSDE). We evaluate
gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous control tasks, and directly on
three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic robot, a quadruped and an

                                        <span>The capability of reinforcement learning (RL) agent directly depends on the
diversity of learning scenarios the environment generates and how closely it
captures real-world situations. However, existing environments/simulators lack
the support to systematically model distributions over initial states and
transition dynamics. Furthermore, in complex domains such as soccer, the space
of possible scenarios is infinite, which makes it impossible for one research
group to provide a comprehensive set of scenarios to train, test, and benchmark
RL algorithms. To address this issue, for the first time, we adopt an existing
formal scenario specification language, SCENIC, to intuitively model and
generate interactive scenarios. We interfaced SCENIC to Google Research Soccer
environment to create a platform called SCENIC4RL. Using this platform, we
provide a dataset consisting of 36 scenario programs encoded in SCENIC and
demonstration data generated from a subset of them. We share our experimental
results to show the effectiveness of our dataset and the platform to train,
test, and benchmark RL algorithms. More importantly, we open-source our
platform to enable RL community to collectively contribute to constructing a
comprehensive set of scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Motivated by applications in crowdsourced entity resolution in database,
signed edge prediction in social networks and correlation clustering, Mazumdar
and Saha [NIPS 2017] proposed an elegant theoretical model for studying
clustering with a faulty oracle. In this model, given a set of $n$ items which
belong to $k$ unknown groups (or clusters), our goal is to recover the clusters
by asking pairwise queries to an oracle. This oracle can answer the query that
&#x60;&#x60;do items $u$ and $v$ belong to the same cluster?&#x27;&#x27;. However, the answer to
each pairwise query errs with probability $\varepsilon$, for some
$\varepsilon\in(0,\frac12)$. Mazumdar and Saha provided two algorithms under
this model: one algorithm is query-optimal while time-inefficient (i.e.,
running in quasi-polynomial time), the other is time efficient (i.e., in
polynomial time) while query-suboptimal. Larsen, Mitzenmacher and Tsourakakis
[WWW 2020] then gave a new time-efficient algorithm for the special case of $2$
clusters, which is query-optimal if the bias $\delta:&#x3D;1-2\varepsilon$ of the
model is large. It was left as an open question whether one can obtain a
query-optimal, time-efficient algorithm for the general case of $k$ clusters
and other regimes of $\delta$.

In this paper, we make progress on the above question and provide a
time-efficient algorithm with nearly-optimal query complexity (up to a factor
of $O(\log^2 n)$) for all constant $k$ and any $\delta$ in the regime when
information-theoretic recovery is possible. Our algorithm is built on a
connection to the stochastic block model.</span>

                                        <span>The popularity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) has provided us with unprecedented
opportunities to enable a variety of emerging services in a smart home
environment. Among those services, sensing the liquid level in a container is
critical to building many smart home and mobile healthcare applications that
improve the quality of life. This paper presents LiquidSense, a liquid-level
sensing system that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different
daily liquids and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing smart
home networks. LiquidSense uses an existing home WiFi network and a low-cost
transducer that attached to the container to sense the resonance of the
container for liquid level detection. In particular, our system mounts a
low-cost transducer on the surface of the container and emits a well-designed
chirp signal to make the container resonant, which introduces subtle changes to
the home WiFi signals. By analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi
signals, LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for liquid
level detection. Our system constructs prediction models for both continuous
and discrete predictions using curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate
LiquidSense in home environments with containers of three different materials
and six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense achieves an overall
accuracy of 97% for continuous prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for
discrete prediction. Results also show that our system has a large coverage in
a home environment and works well under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Tidal range structures have been considered for large scale electricity
generation for their potential ability to produce reasonable predictable energy
without the emission of greenhouse gases. Once the main forcing components for
driving the tides have deterministic dynamics, the available energy in a given
tidal power plant has been estimated, through analytical and numerical
optimisation routines, as a mostly predictable event. This constraint imposes
state-of-art flexible operation methods to rely on tidal predictions
(concurrent with measured data and up to a multiple of half-tidal cycles into
the future) to infer best operational strategies for tidal lagoons, with the
additional cost of requiring to run optimisation routines for every new tide.
In this paper, we propose a novel optimised operation of tidal lagoons with
proximal policy optimisation through Unity ML-Agents. We compare this technique
with 6 different operation optimisation approaches (baselines) devised from the
literature, utilising the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon as a case study. We show
that our approach is successful in maximising energy generation through an
optimised operational policy of turbines and sluices, yielding competitive
results with state-of-the-art methods of optimisation, regardless of test data
used, requiring training once and performing real-time flexible control with
measured ocean data only.</span>

                                        <span>Differential privacy is a restriction on data processing algorithms that
provides strong confidentiality guarantees for individual records in the data.
However, research on proper statistical inference, that is, research on
properly quantifying the uncertainty of the (noisy) sample estimate regarding
the true value in the population, is currently still limited. This paper
proposes and evaluates several strategies to compute valid differentially
private confidence intervals for the median. Instead of computing a
differentially private point estimate and deriving its uncertainty, we directly
estimate the interval bounds and discuss why this approach is superior if
ensuring privacy is important. We also illustrate that addressing both sources
of uncertainty--the error from sampling and the error from protecting the
output--simultaneously should be preferred over simpler approaches that
incorporate the uncertainty in a sequential fashion. We evaluate the
performance of the different algorithms under various parameter settings in
extensive simulation studies and demonstrate how the findings could be applied
in practical settings using data from the 1940 Decennial Census.</span>

functional data remains scarce today. The infinite dimensionality of functional
data means standard learning algorithms can be applied only after appropriate
dimension reduction, typically achieved via basis expansions. Currently, these
bases are chosen a priori without the information for the task at hand and thus
may not be effective for the designated task. We instead propose to adaptively
learn these bases in an end-to-end fashion. We introduce neural networks that
employ a new Basis Layer whose hidden units are each basis functions themselves
implemented as a micro neural network. Our architecture learns to apply
parsimonious dimension reduction to functional inputs that focuses only on
information relevant to the target rather than irrelevant variation in the
input function. Across numerous classification/regression tasks with functional
data, our method empirically outperforms other types of neural networks, and we
prove that our approach is statistically consistent with low generalization

                                        <span>Abstraction is an important aspect of intelligence which enables agents to
construct robust representations for effective decision making. In the last
decade, deep networks are proven to be effective due to their ability to form
increasingly complex abstractions. However, these abstractions are distributed
over many neurons, making the re-use of a learned skill costly. Previous work
either enforced formation of abstractions creating a designer bias, or used a
large number of neural units without investigating how to obtain high-level
features that may more effectively capture the source task. For avoiding
designer bias and unsparing resource use, we propose to exploit neural response
dynamics to form compact representations to use in skill transfer. For this, we
consider two competing methods based on (1) maximum information compression
principle and (2) the notion that abstract events tend to generate slowly
changing signals, and apply them to the neural signals generated during task
execution. To be concrete, in our simulation experiments, we either apply
principal component analysis (PCA) or slow feature analysis (SFA) on the
signals collected from the last hidden layer of a deep network while it
performs a source task, and use these features for skill transfer in a new
target task. We compare the generalization performance of these alternatives
with the baselines of skill transfer with full layer output and no-transfer
settings. Our results show that SFA units are the most successful for skill
transfer. SFA as well as PCA, incur less resources compared to usual skill

end-effector-obstacle-goal relations. Finally, SFA units with lowest
eigenvalues resembles symbolic representations that highly correlate with
high-level features such as joint angles which might be thought of precursors
for fully symbolic systems.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects using only few
examples. It&#x27;s critically needed for many practical applications but so far
remains challenging. We propose a meta-learning based few-shot object detection
method by transferring meta-knowledge learned from data-abundant base classes
to data-scarce novel classes. Our method incorporates a coarse-to-fine approach
into the proposal based object detection framework and integrates prototype
based classifiers into both the proposal generation and classification stages.
To improve proposal generation for few-shot novel classes, we propose to learn
a lightweight matching network to measure the similarity between each spatial
position in the query image feature map and spatially-pooled class features,
instead of the traditional object/nonobject classifier, thus generating
category-specific proposals and improving proposal recall for novel classes. To
address the spatial misalignment between generated proposals and few-shot class
examples, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method, thus improving
the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we jointly learn a
Faster R-CNN detection head for base classes. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple FSOD benchmarks show our proposed approach achieves state of the
art results under (incremental) few-shot learning settings.</span>

                                        <span>Thanks to the improvements experienced in technology in the last few years,
most especially in virtual reality systems, the number and potential of
networked virtual environments or NVEs and their users are increasing. NVEs aim
to give distributed users a feeling of immersion in a virtual world and the
possibility of interacting with other users or with virtual objects inside it,
like when they interact in the real world. Being able to provide that feeling
and natural interactions when the users are geographically separated is one of
the goals of these systems. Nevertheless, this goal is especially sensitive to
different issues, such as different connections with heterogeneous throughput
or different network latencies, which can lead to consistency and
synchronization problems and, thus, to a worsening of the users&#x27; quality of
experience or QoE. With the purpose of solving these issues, researchers have
proposed and evaluated numerous technical solutions, in fields like network
architectures, data distribution and filtering, resource balancing, computing
models, predictive modeling and synchronization in NVEs. This paper gathers and
classifies them, summarizing their advantages and disadvantages, using a new
way of classification. With the current increase of the number of NVEs and the
multiple solutions proposed so far, this work aims to become a useful tool and
a starting point not only for future researchers in this field but also for
those who are new in NVEs development, in which guaranteeing a good users&#x27; QoE
is essential.</span>

                                        <span>Human personality traits are the key drivers behind our decision-making,
influencing our life path on a daily basis. Inference of personality traits,
such as Myers-Briggs Personality Type, as well as an understanding of
dependencies between personality traits and users&#x27; behavior on various social
media platforms is of crucial importance to modern research and industry
applications. The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues
makes it possible to perform user personality profiling automatically and
efficiently based on data represented across multiple data modalities. However,
the research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal
social media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different
social network data on machine learning performance has yet to be
comprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, there is not such dataset in the
research community to benchmark. This study is one of the first attempts
towards bridging such an important research gap. Specifically, in this work, we
infer the Myers-Briggs Personality Type indicators, by applying a novel
multi-view fusion framework, called &quot;PERS&quot; and comparing the performance
results not just across data modalities but also with respect to different
social network data sources. Our experimental results demonstrate the PERS&#x27;s
ability to learn from multi-view data for personality profiling by efficiently
leveraging on the significantly different data arriving from diverse social
multimedia sources. We have also found that the selection of a machine learning
approach is of crucial importance when choosing social network data sources and
that people tend to reveal multiple facets of their personality in different
social media avenues. Our released social multimedia dataset facilitates future
research on this direction.</span>

                                        <span>Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character
recognition (OCR) results into plain texts and then utilized token-level entity
annotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it
expends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, and the
OCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper,
we propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,
Copy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to
simultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)
a weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information
sequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which
contains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key
information sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input
or predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly
tag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new
state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves
its effectiveness.</span>

distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However,
it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing
cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of
its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like
racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a
machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the
first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online
antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting
signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling
multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any
publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect
and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and
Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that
detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism
category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of
experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.</span>

due to their state-of-the-art performance. Most deep steganalysis classifiers
usually extract noise residuals using high-pass filters as preprocessing steps
and feed them to their deep model for classification. It is observed that
recent steganographic embedding does not always restrict their embedding in the
high-frequency zone; instead, they distribute it as per embedding policy.
Therefore, besides noise residual, learning the embedding zone is another
challenging task. In this work, unlike the conventional approaches, the
proposed model first extracts the noise residual using learned denoising
kernels to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. After preprocessing, the sparse
noise residuals are fed to a novel Multi-Contextual Convolutional Neural
Network (M-CNET) that uses heterogeneous context size to learn the sparse and
low-amplitude representation of noise residuals. The model performance is
further improved by incorporating the Self-Attention module to focus on the
areas prone to steganalytic embedding. A set of comprehensive experiments is
performed to show the proposed scheme&#x27;s efficacy over the prior arts. Besides,
an ablation study is given to justify the contribution of various modules of
the proposed architecture.</span>
