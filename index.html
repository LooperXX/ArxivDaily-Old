                                        <span>In recent years, automatic speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation
has gained momentum thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, especially
in the domains of speech recognition and machine translation. The quality of
such applications is commonly tested with automatic metrics, such as BLEU,
primarily with the goal of assessing improvements of releases or in the context
of evaluation campaigns. However, little is known about how the output of such
systems is perceived by end users or how they compare to human performances in
similar communicative tasks.

In this paper, we present the results of an experiment aimed at evaluating
the quality of a real-time speech translation engine by comparing it to the
performance of professional simultaneous interpreters. To do so, we adopt a
framework developed for the assessment of human interpreters and use it to
perform a manual evaluation on both human and machine performances. In our
sample, we found better performance for the human interpreters in terms of
intelligibility, while the machine performs slightly better in terms of
informativeness. The limitations of the study and the possible enhancements of
the chosen framework are discussed. Despite its intrinsic limitations, the use
of this framework represents a first step towards a user-centric and
communication-oriented methodology for evaluating real-time automatic speech
translation.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment quantification is the task of estimating the relative frequency (or
&quot;prevalence&quot;) of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral,
Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts; this is especially important when
these texts are tweets, since most sentiment classification endeavours carried
out on Twitter data actually have quantification (and not the classification of
individual tweets) as their ultimate goal. It is well-known that solving
quantification via &quot;classify and count&quot; (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled
items via a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned
to a given class) is suboptimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate
quantification methods exist. In 2016, Gao and Sebastiani carried out a
systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment
quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimental protocol
followed in that work is flawed, and that its results are thus unreliable. We
now re-evaluate those quantification methods on the very same datasets, this
time following a now consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol,
that involves 5775 as many experiments as run in the original study. Our
experimentation yields results dramatically different from those obtained by
Gao and Sebastiani, and thus provide a different, much more solid understanding
of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.</span>

exploit the underlying features of various modalities to enable end-to-end

technologies, as well as in other spheres of AI, leading researchers to train
more complex and deeper models. These improvements came at the cost of
transparency. DNNs are innately opaque and difficult to interpret. We no longer
understand what features are learned, where they are preserved, and how they
inter-operate. Such an analysis is important for better model understanding,
debugging and to ensure fairness in ethical decision making. In this work, we
analyze the representations trained within deep speech models, towards the task
of speaker recognition, dialect identification and reconstruction of masked
signals. We carry a layer- and neuron-level analysis on the utterance-level
representations captured within pretrained speech models for speaker, language
and channel properties. We study: is this information captured in the learned
representations? where is it preserved? how is it distributed? and can we
identify a minimal subset of network that posses this information. Using
diagnostic classifiers, we answered these questions. Our results reveal: (i)
channel and gender information is omnipresent and is redundantly distributed
(ii) complex properties such as dialectal information is encoded only in the
task-oriented pretrained network and is localised in the upper layers (iii) a
minimal subset of neurons can be extracted to encode the predefined property
(iv) salient neurons are sometimes shared between properties and can highlights
presence of biases in the network. Our cross-architectural comparison indicates
that (v) the pretrained models captures speaker-invariant information and (vi)
the pretrained CNNs models are competitive to the Transformers for encoding
information for the studied properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to investigate neuron analysis on the speech models.</span>

models and have been shown to improve the prediction performance, it has been
reported to be vulnerable to perturbations to the mechanism. To overcome the
vulnerability to perturbations in the mechanism, we are inspired by adversarial
training (AT), which is a powerful regularization technique for enhancing the
robustness of the models. In this paper, we propose a general training
technique for natural language processing tasks, including AT for attention
(Attention AT) and more interpretable AT for attention (Attention iAT). The
proposed techniques improved the prediction performance and the model
interpretability by exploiting the mechanisms with AT. In particular, Attention
iAT boosts those advantages by introducing adversarial perturbation, which
enhances the difference in the attention of the sentences. Evaluation
experiments with ten open datasets revealed that AT for attention mechanisms,
especially Attention iAT, demonstrated (1) the best performance in nine out of
ten tasks and (2) more interpretable attention (i.e., the resulting attention
correlated more strongly with gradient-based word importance) for all tasks.
Additionally, the proposed techniques are (3) much less dependent on
perturbation size in AT. Our code is available at

extended to the online variants for streaming automatic speech recognition
(ASR), such as monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA), the models still have a
large label emission latency because of the unconstrained end-to-end training
objective. Previous works tackled this problem by leveraging alignment
information to control the timing to emit tokens during training. In this work,
we propose a simple alignment-free regularization method, StableEmit, to
encourage MoChA to emit tokens earlier. StableEmit discounts the selection
probabilities in hard monotonic attention for token boundary detection by a
constant factor and regularizes them to recover the total attention mass during
training. As a result, the scale of the selection probabilities is increased,
and the values can reach a threshold for token emission earlier, leading to a
reduction of emission latency and deletion errors. Moreover, StableEmit can be
combined with methods that constraint alignments to further improve the
accuracy and latency. Experimental evaluations with LSTM and Conformer encoders
demonstrate that StableEmit significantly reduces the recognition errors and
the emission latency simultaneously. We also show that the use of alignment
information is complementary in both metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Self-attention (SA), which encodes vector sequences according to their
pairwise similarity, is widely used in speech recognition due to its strong
context modeling ability. However, when applied to long sequence data, its
accuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average
operator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which
results in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this
issue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention
(RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of
self-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the
local window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different
test data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window
length is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further
generalize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the
performance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based
speech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin
speech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate
(CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the
SA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is
only slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to
tune the window length manually.</span>

2021 on Swiss German Speech to Standard German Text, a public competition on
dialect recognition and translation. Swiss German refers to the multitude of
Alemannic dialects spoken in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. Swiss
German differs significantly from standard German in pronunciation, word
inventory and grammar. It is mostly incomprehensible to native German speakers.
Moreover, it lacks a standardized written script. To solve the challenging
task, we propose a hybrid automatic speech recognition system with a lexicon
that incorporates translations, a 1st pass language model that deals with Swiss
German particularities, a transfer-learned acoustic model and a strong neural
language model for 2nd pass rescoring. Our submission reaches 46.04% BLEU on a
blind conversational test set and outperforms the second best competitor by a
12% relative margin.</span>

a set of elementary operations (writing/erasing a letter, going to the right or
to the left,...) and we define a keyboard as a set of finite sequences of such
operations, called keys. The corresponding language is the set of words
obtained by applying some sequence of those keys. Unlike classical models of
computation, every key can be applied anytime. We define various classes of
languages based on different sets of elementary operations, and compare their
expressive powers. We also compare them to well-known classes of languages
(Chomsky hierarchy). We obtain a strict hierarchy of languages, whose
expressivity is orthogonal to the one of the aforementionned classical models.

                                        <span>Models of narrative schema knowledge have proven useful for a range of
event-related tasks, but they typically do not capture the temporal
relationships between events. We propose a single model that addresses both
temporal ordering, sorting given events into the order they occurred, and event
infilling, predicting new events which fit into an existing temporally-ordered
sequence. We use a BART-based conditional generation model that can capture
both temporality and common event co-occurrence, meaning it can be flexibly
applied to different tasks in this space. Our model is trained as a denoising
autoencoder: we take temporally-ordered event sequences, shuffle them, delete
some events, and then attempt to recover the original event sequence. This task
teaches the model to make inferences given incomplete knowledge about the
events in an underlying scenario. On the temporal ordering task, we show that
our model is able to unscramble event sequences from existing datasets without
access to explicitly labeled temporal training data, outperforming both a
BERT-based pairwise model and a BERT-based pointer network. On event infilling,
human evaluation shows that our model is able to generate events that fit
better temporally into the input events when compared to GPT-2 story completion
models.</span>

                                        <span>Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental research task in digital text
forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the
same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that
focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first
category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features,
where one has full control over which features are considered and what they
actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV
methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control
mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a
potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear
the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions,
which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To
tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise,
which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV
methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the
writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into
the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better
results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases,
with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%.</span>

                                        <span>Training the large deep neural networks that dominate NLP requires large
datasets. Many of these are collected automatically or via crowdsourcing, and
may exhibit systematic biases or annotation artifacts. By the latter, we mean
correlations between inputs and outputs that are spurious, insofar as they do
not represent a generally held causal relationship between features and
classes; models that exploit such correlations may appear to perform a given
task well, but fail on out of sample data. In this paper we propose methods to
facilitate identification of training data artifacts, using new hybrid
approaches that combine saliency maps (which highlight important input
features) with instance attribution methods (which retrieve training samples
influential to a given prediction). We show that this proposed training-feature
attribution approach can be used to uncover artifacts in training data, and use
it to identify previously unreported artifacts in a few standard NLP datasets.
We execute a small user study to evaluate whether these methods are useful to
NLP researchers in practice, with promising results. We make code for all
methods and experiments in this paper available.</span>

approached as a sequence tagging problem by classifying each recognized input
token into one of the IOB (Inside, Outside, and Beginning) categories. However,
such problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it cannot easily
handle complex spatial relationships and (2) it is not suitable for highly
structured information, which are nevertheless frequently observed in
real-world document images. To tackle these issues, we first formulate the IE
task as spatial dependency parsing problem that focuses on the relationship
among text tokens in the documents. Under this setup, we then propose SPADE
(SPAtial DEpendency parser) that models highly complex spatial relationships
and an arbitrary number of information layers in the documents in an end-to-end
manner. We evaluate it on various kinds of documents such as receipts, name

explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image,
while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to
high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of
latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the
refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of
compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic
transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows
flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of
the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model&#x27;s strength and
robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from
simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor
scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality
and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further
qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model&#x27;s

high-quality semantic representations, these models are still vulnerable to
simple perturbations. Recent works aimed to improve the robustness of
pre-trained models mainly focus on adversarial training from perturbed examples
with similar semantics, neglecting the utilization of different or even
opposite semantics. Different from the image processing field, the text is
discrete and few word substitutions can cause significant semantic changes. To
study the impact of semantics caused by small perturbations, we conduct a
series of pilot experiments and surprisingly find that adversarial training is
useless or even harmful for the model to detect these semantic changes. To
address this problem, we propose Contrastive Learning with semantIc Negative
Examples (CLINE), which constructs semantic negative examples unsupervised to
improve the robustness under semantically adversarial attacking. By comparing
with similar and opposite semantic examples, the model can effectively perceive
the semantic changes caused by small perturbations. Empirical results show that
our approach yields substantial improvements on a range of sentiment analysis,
reasoning, and reading comprehension tasks. And CLINE also ensures the
compactness within the same semantics and separability across different
semantics in sentence-level.</span>

                                        <span>Multilingual neural machine translation has shown the capability of directly
translating between language pairs unseen in training, i.e. zero-shot
translation. Despite being conceptually attractive, it often suffers from low
output quality. The difficulty of generalizing to new translation directions
suggests the model representations are highly specific to those language pairs
seen in training. We demonstrate that a main factor causing the
language-specific representations is the positional correspondence to input
tokens. We show that this can be easily alleviated by removing residual
connections in an encoder layer. With this modification, we gain up to 18.5
BLEU points on zero-shot translation while retaining quality on supervised
directions. The improvements are particularly prominent between related
languages, where our proposed model outperforms pivot-based translation.
Moreover, our approach allows easy integration of new languages, which
substantially expands translation coverage. By thorough inspections of the
hidden layer outputs, we show that our approach indeed leads to more
language-independent representations.</span>

offline speech translation track. This year we made various efforts on training
data, architecture, and audio segmentation. On the data side, we investigated
sequence-level knowledge distillation (SeqKD) for end-to-end (E2E) speech
translation. Specifically, we used multi-referenced SeqKD from multiple
teachers trained on different amounts of bitext. On the architecture side, we
adopted the Conformer encoder and the Multi-Decoder architecture, which equips
dedicated decoders for speech recognition and translation tasks in a unified
encoder-decoder model and enables search in both source and target language
spaces during inference. We also significantly improved audio segmentation by
using the pyannote.audio toolkit and merging multiple short segments for long
context modeling. Experimental evaluations showed that each of them contributed
to large improvements in translation performance. Our best E2E system combined
all the above techniques with model ensembling and achieved 31.4 BLEU on the
2-ref of tst2021 and 21.2 BLEU and 19.3 BLEU on the two single references of

                                        <span>Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an active field in natural language
processing with many successful developed models in recent years. Despite their
high in-distribution accuracy, these models suffer from two issues: high
training cost and low out-of-distribution accuracy. Even though some approaches
have been presented to tackle the generalization problem, they have high,
intolerable training costs. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
ensemble learning approach to improve generalization of MRC systems without
retraining a big model. After separately training the base models with
different structures on different datasets, they are ensembled using weighting
and stacking approaches in probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings. Three
configurations are investigated including heterogeneous, homogeneous, and
hybrid on eight datasets and six state-of-the-art models. We identify the
important factors in the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Also, we compare
the robustness of ensemble and fine-tuned models against data distribution
shifts. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the
ensemble approach in improving the out-of-distribution accuracy of MRC systems,
especially when the base models are similar in accuracies.</span>

                                        <span>Previous works indicate that the glyph of Chinese characters contains rich
semantic information and has the potential to enhance the representation of
Chinese characters. The typical method to utilize the glyph features is by
incorporating them into the character embedding space. Inspired by previous
methods, we innovatively propose a Chinese pre-trained representation model
named as GlyphCRM, which abandons the ID-based character embedding method yet
solely based on sequential character images. We render each character into a
binary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it.
Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network,
namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese
characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer
blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information.
Meanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph
module into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to
fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module
can obtain a sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the
long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. Extensive
experimental results indicate that GlyphCRM substantially outperforms the
previous BERT-based state-of-the-art model on 9 fine-tuning tasks, and it has
strong transferability and generalization on specialized fields and
low-resource tasks. We hope this work could spark further research beyond the
realms of well-established representation of Chinese texts.</span>

phrase is translated in the output sentence. The system is trained to output
special placeholder tokens, and the user-specified term is injected into the
output through the context-free replacement of the placeholder token. However,
this approach could result in ungrammatical sentences because it is often the
case that the specified term needs to be inflected according to the context of
the output, which is unknown before the translation. To address this problem,
we propose a novel method of placeholder translation that can inflect specified
terms according to the grammatical construction of the output sentence. We
extend the sequence-to-sequence architecture with a character-level decoder
that takes the lemma of a user-specified term and the words generated from the
word-level decoder to output the correct inflected form of the lemma. We
evaluate our approach with a Japanese-to-English translation task in the
scientific writing domain, and show that our model can incorporate specified
terms in the correct form more successfully than other comparable models.</span>

                                        <span>Citation context analysis (CCA) is an important task in natural language
processing that studies how and why scholars discuss each others&#x27; work. Despite
being studied for decades, traditional frameworks for CCA have largely relied
on overly-simplistic assumptions of how authors cite, which ignore several
important phenomena. For instance, scholarly papers often contain rich
discussions of cited work that span multiple sentences and express multiple
intents concurrently. Yet, CCA is typically approached as a single-sentence,
single-label classification task, and thus existing datasets fail to capture
this interesting discourse. In our work, we address this research gap by
proposing a novel framework for CCA as a document-level context extraction and
labeling task. We release MultiCite, a new dataset of 12,653 citation contexts
from over 1,200 computational linguistics papers. Not only is it the largest
collection of expert-annotated citation contexts to-date, MultiCite contains
multi-sentence, multi-label citation contexts within full paper texts. Finally,
we demonstrate how our dataset, while still usable for training classic CCA
models, also supports the development of new types of models for CCA beyond
fixed-width text classification. We release our code and dataset at

argumentation remains challenging. The primary reason lies in the inherent
complexity of the human processes behind, which commonly requires the
integration of extensive knowledge far beyond what is needed for many other
natural language understanding tasks. Existing work on the mining, assessment,
reasoning, and generation of arguments acknowledges this issue, calling for
more research on the integration of common sense and world knowledge into
computational models. However, a systematic effort to collect and organize the
types of knowledge needed is still missing, hindering targeted progress in the
field. In this opinionated survey paper, we address the issue by (1) proposing
a pyramid of types of knowledge required in computational argumentation, (2)
briefly discussing the state of the art on the role and integration of these
types in the field, and (3) outlining the main challenges for future work.</span>

                                        <span>Quality Estimation (QE) is the task of automatically predicting Machine
Translation quality in the absence of reference translations, making it
applicable in real-time settings, such as translating online social media
conversations. Recent success in QE stems from the use of multilingual
pre-trained representations, where very large models lead to impressive
results. However, the inference time, disk and memory requirements of such
models do not allow for wide usage in the real world. Models trained on
distilled pre-trained representations remain prohibitively large for many usage
scenarios. We instead propose to directly transfer knowledge from a strong QE
teacher model to a much smaller model with a different, shallower architecture.
We show that this approach, in combination with data augmentation, leads to
light-weight QE models that perform competitively with distilled pre-trained
representations with 8x fewer parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Capturing interactions among event arguments is an essential step towards
robust event argument extraction (EAE). However, existing efforts in this
direction suffer from two limitations: 1) The argument role type information of
contextual entities is mainly utilized as training signals, ignoring the
potential merits of directly adopting it as semantically rich input features;
2) The argument-level sequential semantics, which implies the overall
distribution pattern of argument roles over an event mention, is not well
characterized. To tackle the above two bottlenecks, we formalize EAE as a
Seq2Seq-like learning problem for the first time, where a sentence with a
specific event trigger is mapped to a sequence of event argument roles. A
neural architecture with a novel Bi-directional Entity-level Recurrent Decoder
(BERD) is proposed to generate argument roles by incorporating contextual
entities&#x27; argument role predictions, like a word-by-word text generation
process, thereby distinguishing implicit argument distribution patterns within
an event more accurately.</span>

challenge, since the model needs to infer and produce the corresponding pronoun

zero pronouns often needs discourse context, in some cases, the local context
within a sentence gives clues to the inference of the zero pronoun. In this
study, we propose a data augmentation method that provides additional training

pipelines largely depend on automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules, which

Speech Translation task. We proposed a novel simultaneous translation model,
Cross Attention Augmented Transducer (CAAT), which extends conventional RNN-T
to sequence-to-sequence tasks without monotonic constraints, e.g., simultaneous
translation. Experiments on speech-to-text (S2T) and text-to-text (T2T)
simultaneous translation tasks shows CAAT achieves better quality-latency
trade-offs compared to \textit{wait-k}, one of the previous state-of-the-art
approaches. Based on CAAT architecture and data augmentation, we build S2T and
T2T simultaneous translation systems in this evaluation campaign. Compared to
last year&#x27;s optimal systems, our S2T simultaneous translation system improves
by an average of 11.3 BLEU for all latency regimes, and our T2T simultaneous

such as seeking clarifications about the question, taking advantage of clues,
abstaining in order to avoid incorrect answers, etc. This difference in task
formulation hinders the adoption of NLP systems in real-world settings. In this
work, we take a step towards bridging this gap and present a multi-stage task
that simulates a typical human-human questioner-responder interaction such as
an interview. Specifically, the system is provided with question
simplifications, knowledge statements, examples, etc. at various stages to
improve its prediction when it is not sufficiently confident. We instantiate
the proposed task in Natural Language Inference setting where a system is
evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and find that the multi-stage formulation of our task
leads to OOD generalization performance improvement up to 2.29% in Stage 1,
1.91% in Stage 2, 54.88% in Stage 3, and 72.02% in Stage 4 over the standard
unguided prediction. However, our task leaves a significant challenge for NLP
researchers to further improve OOD performance at each stage.</span>

                                        <span>Human evaluations are typically considered the gold standard in natural
language generation, but as models&#x27; fluency improves, how well can evaluators
detect and judge machine-generated text? We run a study assessing non-experts&#x27;
ability to distinguish between human- and machine-authored text (GPT2 and GPT3)
in three domains (stories, news articles, and recipes). We find that, without
training, evaluators distinguished between GPT3- and human-authored text at
random chance level. We explore three approaches for quickly training
evaluators to better identify GPT3-authored text (detailed instructions,
annotated examples, and paired examples) and find that while evaluators&#x27;
accuracy improved up to 55%, it did not significantly improve across the three
domains. Given the inconsistent results across text domains and the often
contradictory reasons evaluators gave for their judgments, we examine the role
untrained human evaluations play in NLG evaluation and provide recommendations
to NLG researchers for improving human evaluations of text generated from
state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>The growth of online consumer health questions has led to the necessity for
reliable and accurate question answering systems. A recent study showed that
manual summarization of consumer health questions brings significant
improvement in retrieving relevant answers. However, the automatic
summarization of long questions is a challenging task due to the lack of
training data and the complexity of the related subtasks, such as the question
focus and type recognition. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement
learning-based framework for abstractive question summarization. We propose two
novel rewards obtained from the downstream tasks of (i) question-type
identification and (ii) question-focus recognition to regularize the question
generation model. These rewards ensure the generation of semantically valid
questions and encourage the inclusion of key medical entities/foci in the
question summary. We evaluated our proposed method on two benchmark datasets
and achieved higher performance over state-of-the-art models. The manual
evaluation of the summaries reveals that the generated questions are more
diverse and have fewer factual inconsistencies than the baseline summaries</span>

political events. Automated systems parse large volumes of text data to infer
or extract structured information that describes actors, actions, dates, times,

coordinates associated with events or locations described by a given text. We
present an end-to-end probabilistic model for geocoding text data.
Additionally, we collect a novel data set for evaluating the performance of
geocoding systems. We compare the model-based solution, called ELECTRo-map, to
the current state-of-the-art open source system for geocoding texts for event
data. Finally, we discuss the benefits of end-to-end model-based geocoding,
including principled uncertainty estimation and the ability of these models to

shared goals. Successful collaboration requires not only adopting the same
communicative conventions, but also grounding these conventions in the same
task-appropriate conceptual abstractions. We investigate how humans use natural
language to collaboratively solve physical assembly problems more effectively
over time. Human participants were paired up in an online environment to
reconstruct scenes containing two block towers. One participant could see the
target towers, and sent assembly instructions for the other participant to
reconstruct. Participants provided increasingly concise instructions across
repeated attempts on each pair of towers, using higher-level referring
expressions that captured each scene&#x27;s hierarchical structure. To explain these
findings, we extend recent probabilistic models of ad-hoc convention formation
with an explicit perceptual learning mechanism. These results shed light on the
inductive biases that enable intelligent agents to coordinate upon shared
procedural abstractions.</span>

                                        <span>In his pioneering research, G. K. Zipf formulated a couple of statistical
laws on the relationship between the frequency of a word with its number of
meanings: the law of meaning distribution, relating the frequency of a word and
its frequency rank, and the meaning-frequency law, relating the frequency of a
word with its number of meanings. Although these laws were formulated more than
half a century ago, they have been only investigated in a few languages. Here
we present the first study of these laws in Catalan.

We verify these laws in Catalan via the relationship among their exponents
and that of the rank-frequency law. We present a new protocol for the analysis
of these Zipfian laws that can be extended to other languages. We report the
first evidence of two marked regimes for these laws in written language and
speech, paralleling the two regimes in Zipf&#x27;s rank-frequency law in large
multi-author corpora discovered in early 2000s. Finally, the implications of
these two regimes will be discussed.</span>

further use both exemplars and automatically generated templates to improve
controllability and diversity. Experiments on two newly collected large-scale

pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for
resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of
parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating
BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing
strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving
competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long
inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly
improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed
confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional
parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT
achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2$\times$ to 10$\times$
with negligible accuracy degradation compared to ALBERT on various datasets.
Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used
for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to
understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the
decision-making process of it in ELBERT.</span>

                                        <span>One of the most prominent attributes of Neural Networks (NNs) constitutes
their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from
high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their
exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of
modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex
cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to
deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack
of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their
general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted
features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding
the vector space before the NNs&#x27; output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten
the deep feature vectors&#x27; properties under classification tasks. Main attention
is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse
effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived
from our model&#x27;s formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition
scenarios, proving its prominence by improving the obtained results.</span>

explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image,
while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to
high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of
latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the
refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of
compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic
transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows
flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of
the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model&#x27;s strength and
robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from
simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor
scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality
and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further
qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model&#x27;s
inner workings, revealing improved interpretability and stronger
disentanglement, and illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach. An
implementation of the model is available at

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

high dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum
many-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with
tensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification. In
this work, we propose a novel formulation of tensor networks for supervised
image segmentation which allows them to operate on high resolution medical
images. We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping
patches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a
pixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed
model is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a
Strided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of
the proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and
compared to relevant baselines. The evaluation shows that the strided tensor
network yields competitive performance compared to CNN-based models while using
fewer resources. Additionally, based on the experiments we discuss the
feasibility of using fully linear models for segmentation tasks.</span>

proposed in this paper. Different feature fusion techniques are suggested to
facilitate the flow of information and improve the training of deep neural
networks. Some of these techniques as well as the proposed network can be
considered a type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Network, where a layer can
receive inputs from other layers and have outputs to other layers. In the
proposed general framework of Lattice Fusion Network (LFNet), feature maps of
each convolutional layer are passed to other layers based on a lattice graph
structure, where nodes are convolutional layers. To evaluate the performance of
the proposed architecture, different designs based on the general framework of
LFNet are implemented for the task of image denoising. This task is used as an
example where training deep convolutional networks is needed. Results are
compared with state of the art methods. The proposed network is able to achieve
better results with far fewer learnable parameters, which shows the
effectiveness of LFNets for training of deep neural networks.</span>

radiology scans, molecular profiling, histopathology slides, and clinical
factors. Despite the importance of these modalities individually, no deep
learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis.
Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse
multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to
combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities
(such as H&amp;E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a
comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality
are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the
information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal
orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by
incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS
in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly
outperforming (p&#x3D;0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median
C-index of 0.718 +/- 0.064. The prognostic model significantly stratifies
glioma patients by OS within clinical subsets, adding further granularity to
prognostic clinical grading and molecular subtyping.</span>

several domains, relying on minimal architectural priors from the designer. In
Human Action Recognition (HAR), attention mechanisms have been primarily
adopted on top of standard convolutional or recurrent layers, improving the
overall generalization capability. In this work, we introduce Action
Transformer (AcT), a simple, fully self-attentional architecture that
consistently outperforms more elaborated networks that mix convolutional,
recurrent, and attentive layers. In order to limit computational and energy
requests, building on previous human action recognition research, the proposed
approach exploits 2D pose representations over small temporal windows,
providing a low latency solution for accurate and effective real-time
performance. Moreover, we open-source MPOSE2021, a new large-scale dataset, as
an attempt to build a formal training and evaluation benchmark for real-time
short-time human action recognition. Extensive experimentation on MPOSE2021
with our proposed methodology and several previous architectural solutions

annotations for the entire dataset, while capturing all the difficult corner
cases. Interestingly, we observed that color variants are essentially
manifestations of color jitter based augmentations. Thus, we instead explore
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to solve this problem. We observed that existing
state-of-the-art SSL methods perform poor, for our problem. To address this, we
propose a novel SSL based color variants model that simultaneously focuses on
different parts of an apparel. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows
that our method outperforms existing SSL methods, and at times, the supervised
model.</span>

                                        <span>Face editing represents a popular research topic within the computer vision
and image processing communities. While significant progress has been made
recently in this area, existing solutions: (i) are still largely focused on
low-resolution images, (ii) often generate editing results with visual
artefacts, or (iii) lack fine-grained control and alter multiple (entangled)
attributes at once, when trying to generate the desired facial semantics. In
this paper, we aim to address these issues though a novel attribute editing
approach called MaskFaceGAN. The proposed approach is based on an optimization
procedure that directly optimizes the latent code of a pre-trained
(state-of-the-art) Generative Adversarial Network (i.e., StyleGAN2) with
respect to several constraints that ensure: (i) preservation of relevant image
content, (ii) generation of the targeted facial attributes, and (iii)
spatially--selective treatment of local image areas. The constraints are
enforced with the help of an (differentiable) attribute classifier and face
parser that provide the necessary reference information for the optimization
procedure. MaskFaceGAN is evaluated in extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ,
Helen and SiblingsDB-HQf datasets and in comparison with several
state-of-the-art techniques from the literature, i.e., StarGAN, AttGAN, STGAN,
and two versions of InterFaceGAN. Our experimental results show that the
proposed approach is able to edit face images with respect to several facial
attributes with unprecedented image quality and at high-resolutions
(1024x1024), while exhibiting considerably less problems with attribute
entanglement than competing solutions. The source code is made freely available

in complex environments due to the additional depth information introduced in
the data. Inevitably, an independent stream is introduced to extract features
from depth images, leading to extra computation and parameters. This
methodology which sacrifices the model size to improve the detection accuracy
may impede the practical application of SOD problems. To tackle this dilemma,
we propose a dynamic distillation method along with a lightweight framework,
which significantly reduces the parameters. This method considers the factors
of both teacher and student performance within the training stage and
dynamically assigns the distillation weight instead of applying a fixed weight
on the student model. Extensive experiments are conducted on five public

enable applications such as autonomous driving, socially-aware robot assistant
and public safety monitoring. Deciphering human behaviors to predict their
future paths/trajectories and what they would do from videos is important in
these applications. However, human trajectory prediction still remains a
challenging task, as scene semantics and human intent are difficult to model.
Many systems do not provide high-level semantic attributes to reason about
pedestrian future. This design hinders prediction performance in video data
from diverse domains and unseen scenarios. To enable optimal future human

model for automated localization of clinically significant prostate cancer
(csPCa) in bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI). Deep attention mechanisms drive
its detection network, targeting salient structures and highly discriminative
feature dimensions across multiple resolutions. Its goal is to accurately
identify csPCa lesions from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign
pathology that can afflict the prostate gland. Simultaneously, a decoupled
residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive reduction,
without sacrificing high sensitivity or computational efficiency. In order to
guide model generalization with domain-specific clinical knowledge, a
probabilistic anatomical prior is used to encode the spatial prevalence and
zonal distinction of csPCa. Using a large dataset of 1950 prostate bpMRI paired
with radiologically-estimated annotations, we hypothesize that such CNN-based
models can be trained to detect biopsy-confirmed malignancies in an independent
cohort.

For 486 institutional testing scans, the 3D CAD system achieves
83.69$\pm$5.22% and 93.19$\pm$2.96% detection sensitivity at 0.50 and 1.46

learning to perform vision-based manipulation (e.g. picking up objects)? We
study this problem under the framework of transfer learning, where the model is
first trained on a passive vision task, and adapted to perform an active
manipulation task. We find that pre-training on vision tasks significantly
improves generalization and sample efficiency for learning to manipulate
objects. However, realizing these gains requires careful selection of which
parts of the model to transfer. Our key insight is that outputs of standard
vision models highly correlate with affordance maps commonly used in
manipulation. Therefore, we explore directly transferring model parameters from
vision networks to affordance prediction networks, and show that this can
result in successful zero-shot adaptation, where a robot can pick up certain
objects with zero robotic experience. With just a small amount of robotic
experience, we can further fine-tune the affordance model to achieve better
results. With just 10 minutes of suction experience or 1 hour of grasping
experience, our method achieves ~80% success rate at picking up novel objects.</span>

                                        <span>We present CSWin Transformer, an efficient and effective Transformer-based
backbone for general-purpose vision tasks. A challenging issue in Transformer
design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local
self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address
this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for
computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel
that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the
input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a detailed mathematical
analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for
different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling
capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce
Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional
information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports
arbitrary input resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for
downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure,
CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks.
Specifically, it achieves 85.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra
training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection
task, and 51.7 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing
previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and
+2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting. By further pretraining on
the larger dataset ImageNet-21K, we achieve 87.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K
and state-of-the-art segmentation performance on ADE20K with 55.2 mIoU. The

                                        <span>6D robotic grasping beyond top-down bin-picking scenarios is a challenging
task. Previous solutions based on 6D grasp synthesis with robot motion planning
usually operate in an open-loop setting, which are sensitive to grasp synthesis
errors. In this work, we propose a new method for learning closed-loop control
policies for 6D grasping. Our policy takes a segmented point cloud of an object
from an egocentric camera as input, and outputs continuous 6D control actions
of the robot gripper for grasping the object. We combine imitation learning and
reinforcement learning and introduce a goal-auxiliary actor-critic algorithm
for policy learning. We demonstrate that our learned policy can be integrated
into a tabletop 6D grasping system and a human-robot handover system to improve
the grasping performance of unseen objects. Our videos and code can be found at

inventory management and remote sensing based forest surveys are largely
carried out through satellite images. However, most of these surveys only use
2D spectral information which normally has not enough clues for ITDD. To fully
explore the satellite images, we propose a ITDD method using the orthophoto and
digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our
algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract
the local maxima from DSM as treetops, and then feed them to a modi-fied
superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown
delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological
characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify
potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three
representative regions have demonstrated promising results - the best overall
detection accuracy can be 89%.</span>

with Point-of-Interest (PoI) features. Differentiating multiple potential
instances within a single PoI feature is challenging because learning a
high-dimensional mask feature for each instance using vanilla convolution
demands a heavy computing burden. To address this challenge, we propose an
instance-aware convolution. It decomposes this mask representation learning
task into two tractable modules as instance-aware weights and instance-agnostic
features. The former is to parametrize convolution for producing mask features
corresponding to different instances, improving mask learning efficiency by
avoiding employing several independent convolutions. Meanwhile, the latter
serves as mask templates in a single point. Together, instance-aware mask
features are computed by convolving the template with dynamic weights, used for
the mask prediction. Along with instance-aware convolution, we propose
PointINS, a simple and practical instance segmentation approach, building upon
dense one-stage detectors. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated the
effectiveness of our framework built upon RetinaNet and FCOS. PointINS in
ResNet101 backbone achieves a 38.3 mask mean average precision (mAP) on COCO
dataset, outperforming existing point-based methods by a large margin. It gives
a comparable performance to the region-based Mask R-CNN with faster inference.</span>

can better be modeled as compositions of objects and their relations as opposed
to distributed representations. This inductive bias can be injected into neural
networks to potentially improve systematic generalization and learning
efficiency of downstream tasks in scenes with multiple objects. In this paper,
we train state-of-the-art unsupervised models on five common multi-object
datasets and evaluate segmentation accuracy and downstream object property
prediction. In addition, we study systematic generalization and robustness by
investigating the settings where either single objects are out-of-distribution
-- e.g., having unseen colors, textures, and shapes -- or global properties of
the scene are altered -- e.g., by occlusions, cropping, or increasing the
number of objects. From our experimental study, we find object-centric
representations to be generally useful for downstream tasks and robust to
shifts in the data distribution, especially if shifts affect single objects.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range
of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as &quot;black-box&quot; and lack of
interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an
intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most
existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while
neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we
focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by
cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable
CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to
only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse
Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few)
class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter&#x27;s activation to pass only
when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and
highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger
interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our
model displays benefits in applications like object localization and
adversarial sample detection. Code link: https://github.com/hyliang96/CSGCNN.</span>

                                        <span>This article introduces a new physics-based method for rigid point set
alignment called Fast Gravitational Approach (FGA). In FGA, the source and
target point sets are interpreted as rigid particle swarms with masses
interacting in a globally multiply-linked manner while moving in a simulated
gravitational force field. The optimal alignment is obtained by explicit
modeling of forces acting on the particles as well as their velocities and
displacements with second-order ordinary differential equations of motion.
Additional alignment cues (point-based or geometric features, and other
boundary conditions) can be integrated into FGA through particle masses. We
propose a smooth-particle mass function for point mass initialization, which
improves robustness to noise and structural discontinuities. To avoid
prohibitive quadratic complexity of all-to-all point interactions, we adapt a
Barnes-Hut tree for accelerated force computation and achieve quasilinear
computational complexity. We show that the new method class has characteristics
not found in previous alignment methods such as efficient handling of partial
overlaps, inhomogeneous point sampling densities, and coping with large point
clouds with reduced runtime compared to the state of the art. Experiments show
that our method performs on par with or outperforms all compared competing
non-deep-learning-based and general-purpose techniques (which do not assume the
availability of training data and a scene prior) in resolving transformations
for LiDAR data and gains state-of-the-art accuracy and speed when coping with
different types of data disturbances.</span>

imminent convective storms. Here, we consider the convective storm nowcasting
problem from the perspective of machine learning. First, we use a pixel-wise
sampling method to construct spatiotemporal features for nowcasting, and
flexibly adjust the proportions of positive and negative samples in the
training set to mitigate class-imbalance issues. Second, we employ a concise
two-stream convolutional neural network to extract spatial and temporal cues
for nowcasting. This simplifies the network structure, reduces the training
time requirement, and improves classification accuracy. The two-stream network
used both radar and satellite data. In the resulting two-stream, fused
convolutional neural network, some of the parameters are entered into a
single-stream convolutional neural network, but it can learn the features of
many data. Further, considering the relevance of classification and regression
tasks, we develop a multi-task learning strategy that predicts the labels used
in such tasks. We integrate two-stream multi-task learning into a single
convolutional neural network. Given the compact architecture, this network is
more efficient and easier to optimize than existing recurrent neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>The subject of &quot;fairness&quot; in artificial intelligence (AI) refers to assessing
AI algorithms for potential bias based on demographic characteristics such as
race and gender, and the development of algorithms to address this bias. Most
applications to date have been in computer vision, although some work in
healthcare has started to emerge. The use of deep learning (DL) in cardiac MR
segmentation has led to impressive results in recent years, and such techniques
are starting to be translated into clinical practice. However, no work has yet
investigated the fairness of such models. In this work, we perform such an
analysis for racial/gender groups, focusing on the problem of training data
imbalance, using a nnU-Net model trained and evaluated on cine short axis
cardiac MR data from the UK Biobank dataset, consisting of 5,903 subjects from
6 different racial groups. We find statistically significant differences in
Dice performance between different racial groups. To reduce the racial bias, we
investigated three strategies: (1) stratified batch sampling, in which batch
sampling is stratified to ensure balance between racial groups; (2) fair
meta-learning for segmentation, in which a DL classifier is trained to classify
race and jointly optimized with the segmentation model; and (3) protected group
models, in which a different segmentation model is trained for each racial
group. We also compared the results to the scenario where we have a perfectly
balanced database. To assess fairness we used the standard deviation (SD) and
skewed error ratio (SER) of the average Dice values. Our results demonstrate
that the racial bias results from the use of imbalanced training data, and that
all proposed bias mitigation strategies improved fairness, with the best SD and
SER resulting from the use of protected group models.</span>

                                        <span>LiDAR-based SLAM system is admittedly more accurate and stable than others,
while its loop closure detection is still an open issue. With the development
of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be
obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and
conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM
with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in
odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a
semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane
constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in
our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve
the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a
global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive
experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly
improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and
achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a novel layer based on fast Walsh-Hadamard
transform (WHT) and smooth-thresholding to replace $1\times 1$ convolution
layers in deep neural networks. In the WHT domain, we denoise the transform
domain coefficients using the new smooth-thresholding non-linearity, a smoothed
version of the well-known soft-thresholding operator. We also introduce a
family of multiplication-free operators from the basic 2$\times$2 Hadamard
transform to implement $3\times 3$ depthwise separable convolution layers.
Using these two types of layers, we replace the bottleneck layers in
MobileNet-V2 to reduce the network&#x27;s number of parameters with a slight loss in
accuracy. For example, by replacing the final third bottleneck layers, we
reduce the number of parameters from 2.270M to 540K. This reduces the accuracy
from 95.21\% to 92.98\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our approach significantly
improves the speed of data processing. The fast Walsh-Hadamard transform has a
computational complexity of $O(m\log_2 m)$. As a result, it is computationally
more efficient than the $1\times1$ convolution layer. The fast Walsh-Hadamard
layer processes a tensor in $\mathbb{R}^{10\times32\times32\times1024}$ about 2
times faster than $1\times1$ convolution layer on NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer
board.</span>

                                        <span>Skeleton sequences are lightweight and compact, thus are ideal candidates for
action recognition on edge devices. Recent skeleton-based action recognition
methods extract features from 3D joint coordinates as spatial-temporal cues,
using these representations in a graph neural network for feature fusion to
boost recognition performance. The use of first- and second-order features,
\ie{} joint and bone representations, has led to high accuracy. Nonetheless,
many models are still confused by actions that have similar motion
trajectories. To address these issues, we propose fusing third-order features
in the form of angular encoding into modern architectures to robustly capture
the relationships between joints and body parts. This simple fusion with
popular spatial-temporal graph neural networks achieves new state-of-the-art
accuracy in two large benchmarks, including NTU60 and NTU120, while employing
fewer parameters and reduced run time. Our source code is publicly available

                                        <span>Multimodal VAEs seek to model the joint distribution over heterogeneous data
(e.g.\ vision, language), whilst also capturing a shared representation across
such modalities. Prior work has typically combined information from the
modalities by reconciling idiosyncratic representations directly in the
recognition model through explicit products, mixtures, or other such
factorisations. Here we introduce a novel alternative, the MEME, that avoids
such explicit combinations by repurposing semi-supervised VAEs to combine
information between modalities implicitly through mutual supervision. This
formulation naturally allows learning from partially-observed data where some
modalities can be entirely missing -- something that most existing approaches
either cannot handle, or do so to a limited extent. We demonstrate that MEME
outperforms baselines on standard metrics across both partial and complete
observation schemes on the MNIST-SVHN (image-image) and CUB (image-text)
datasets. We also contrast the quality of the representations learnt by mutual
supervision against standard approaches and observe interesting trends in its
ability to capture relatedness between data.</span>

some recently proposed algorithms utilized variants of knowledge distillation
(KD) technique to tackle the problem, they only partially addressed the key
additional challenges in CISS that causes the catastrophic forgetting; i.e.,
the semantic drift of the background class and multi-label prediction issue. To
better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M
(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining
several techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we
make three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background
class to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone
network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling
to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny
exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and
stability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better
performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard

challenging tasks directly from visual observations, generalizing learned
skills to novel environments remains very challenging. Extensive use of data
augmentation is a promising technique for improving generalization in RL, but
it is often found to decrease sample efficiency and can even lead to
divergence. In this paper, we investigate causes of instability when using data
augmentation in common off-policy RL algorithms. We identify two problems, both
rooted in high-variance Q-targets. Based on our findings, we propose a simple
yet effective technique for stabilizing this class of algorithms under
augmentation. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of image-based RL using
both ConvNets and Vision Transformers (ViT) on a family of benchmarks based on
DeepMind Control Suite, as well as in robotic manipulation tasks. Our method
greatly improves stability and sample efficiency of ConvNets under
augmentation, and achieves generalization results competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for image-based RL. We further show that our method
scales to RL with ViT-based architectures, and that data augmentation may be
especially important in this setting.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, pure transformer-based models have shown great potentials for
vision tasks such as image classification and detection. However, the design of
transformer networks is challenging. It has been observed that the depth,
embedding dimension, and number of heads can largely affect the performance of
vision transformers. Previous models configure these dimensions based upon
manual crafting. In this work, we propose a new one-shot architecture search
framework, namely AutoFormer, dedicated to vision transformer search.
AutoFormer entangles the weights of different blocks in the same layers during
supernet training. Benefiting from the strategy, the trained supernet allows
thousands of subnets to be very well-trained. Specifically, the performance of
these subnets with weights inherited from the supernet is comparable to those
retrained from scratch. Besides, the searched models, which we refer to
AutoFormers, surpass the recent state-of-the-arts such as ViT and DeiT. In
particular, AutoFormer-tiny/small/base achieve 74.7%/81.7%/82.4% top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet with 5.7M/22.9M/53.7M parameters, respectively. Lastly, we verify
the transferability of AutoFormer by providing the performance on downstream
benchmarks and distillation experiments. Code and models are available at

                                        <span>A generic video summary is an abridged version of a video that conveys the
whole story and features the most important scenes. Yet the importance of
scenes in a video is often subjective, and users should have the option of
customizing the summary by using natural language to specify what is important
to them. Further, existing models for fully automatic generic summarization
have not exploited available language models, which can serve as an effective
prior for saliency. This work introduces CLIP-It, a single framework for
addressing both generic and query-focused video summarization, typically
approached separately in the literature. We propose a language-guided
multimodal transformer that learns to score frames in a video based on their
importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined
query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense
video caption (for generic video summarization). Our model can be extended to
the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. We
outperform baselines and prior work by a significant margin on both standard
video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and a query-focused video
summarization dataset (QFVS). Particularly, we achieve large improvements in
the transfer setting, attesting to our method&#x27;s strong generalization
capabilities.</span>

                                        <span>Binarization is a well-known image processing task, whose objective is to
separate the foreground of an image from the background. One of the many tasks
for which it is useful is that of preprocessing document images in order to
identify relevant information, such as text or symbols. The wide variety of
document types, alphabets, and formats makes binarization challenging. There
are multiple proposals with which to solve this problem, from classical
manually-adjusted methods, to more recent approaches based on machine learning.
The latter techniques require a large amount of training data in order to
obtain good results; however, labeling a portion of each existing collection of
documents is not feasible in practice. This is a common problem in supervised
learning, which can be addressed by using the so-called Domain Adaptation (DA)
techniques. These techniques take advantage of the knowledge learned in one
domain, for which labeled data are available, to apply it to other domains for
which there are no labeled data. This paper proposes a method that combines
neural networks and DA in order to carry out unsupervised document
binarization. However, when both the source and target domains are very
similar, this adaptation could be detrimental. Our methodology, therefore,
first measures the similarity between domains in an innovative manner in order
to determine whether or not it is appropriate to apply the adaptation process.
The results reported in the experimentation, when evaluating up to 20 possible
combinations among five different domains, show that our proposal successfully
deals with the binarization of new document domains without the need for
labeled data.</span>

satellite images, while adjustment accuracy is correlated with feature matching
results. Feature match-ing often contains high uncertainties in weak/repeat
textures, while BA results are helpful in reducing these uncertainties. To
compute more accurate orientations, this article incorpo-rates BA and feature
matching in a unified framework and formulates the union as the optimization of
a global energy function so that the solutions of the BA and feature matching
are constrained with each other. To avoid a degeneracy in the optimization, we
propose a comprised solution by breaking the optimization of the global energy
function into two-step suboptimizations and compute the local minimums of each
suboptimization in an incremental manner. Experiments on multi-view
high-resolution satellite images show that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art orientation techniques with or without accurate least-squares

on specific visual recognition tasks, notably on datasets like ImageNet.
However, high accuracy can be achieved in many ways. The particular decision
function found by a machine learning system is determined not only by the data
to which the system is exposed, but also the inductive biases of the model,
which are typically harder to characterize. In this work, we follow a recent
trend of in-depth behavioral analyses of neural network models that go beyond
accuracy as an evaluation metric by looking at patterns of errors. Our focus is
on comparing a suite of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a
recently-proposed attention-based network, the Vision Transformer (ViT), which
relaxes the translation-invariance constraint of CNNs and therefore represents
a model with a weaker set of inductive biases. Attention-based networks have
previously been shown to achieve higher accuracy than CNNs on vision tasks, and
we demonstrate, using new metrics for examining error consistency with more
granularity, that their errors are also more consistent with those of humans.
These results have implications both for building more human-like vision
models, as well as for understanding visual object recognition in humans.</span>

derived from the multiple observations, that is, semi-sparsity prior knowledge
is more universally applicable, especially in areas where sparsity is not fully
admitted, such as polynomial-smoothing surfaces. We illustrate that this
semi-sparsity can be identified into a generalized $L_0$-norm minimization in
higher-order gradient domains, thereby giving rise to a new &#x60;&#x60;feature-aware&#x27;&#x27;
filtering method with a powerful simultaneous-fitting ability in both sparse
features (singularities and sharpening edges) and non-sparse regions
(polynomial-smoothing surfaces). Notice that a direct solver is always
unavailable due to the non-convexity and combinatorial nature of $L_0$-norm
minimization. Instead, we solve the model based on an efficient half-quadratic
splitting minimization with fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) for acceleration. We
finally demonstrate its versatility and many benefits to a series of

full-body codec avatars, but these avatars still face difficulties in
generating high-fidelity animation of clothing. To address the difficulties, we
propose a method to build an animatable clothed body avatar with an explicit
representation of the clothing on the upper body from multi-view captured
videos. We use a two-layer mesh representation to separately register the 3D
scans with templates. In order to improve the photometric correspondence across
different frames, texture alignment is then performed through inverse rendering
of the clothing geometry and texture predicted by a variational autoencoder. We
then train a new two-layer codec avatar with separate modeling of the upper
clothing and the inner body layer. To learn the interaction between the body
dynamics and clothing states, we use a temporal convolution network to predict
the clothing latent code based on a sequence of input skeletal poses. We show
photorealistic animation output for three different actors, and demonstrate the
advantage of our clothed-body avatars over single-layer avatars in the previous
work. We also show the benefit of an explicit clothing model which allows the
clothing texture to be edited in the animation output.</span>

networks with a single forward pass has recently emerged as a valid alternative
to Bayesian Neural Networks. On the premise of informative representations,
these deterministic uncertainty methods (DUMs) achieve strong performance on
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data while adding negligible computational
costs at inference time. However, it remains unclear whether DUMs are well
calibrated and can seamlessly scale to real-world applications - both
prerequisites for their practical deployment. To this end, we first provide a
taxonomy of DUMs, evaluate their calibration under continuous distributional
shifts and their performance on OOD detection for image classification tasks.
Then, we extend the most promising approaches to semantic segmentation. We find
that, while DUMs scale to realistic vision tasks and perform well on OOD
detection, the practicality of current methods is undermined by poor
calibration under realistic distributional shifts.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on
various computer vision tasks. The ability of capturing short- and long-range
visual dependencies through self-attention is arguably the main source for the
success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead,
especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection). In
this paper, we present focal self-attention, a new mechanism that incorporates
both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions. Using this new
mechanism, each token attends the closest surrounding tokens at fine
granularity but the tokens far away at coarse granularity, and thus can capture
both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively.
With focal self-attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer
models, called Focal Transformer, which achieves superior performance over the
state-of-the-art vision Transformers on a range of public image classification
and object detection benchmarks. In particular, our Focal Transformer models
with a moderate size of 51.1M and a larger size of 89.8M achieve 83.5 and 83.8
Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224x224 resolution.
Using Focal Transformers as the backbones, we obtain consistent and substantial
improvements over the current state-of-the-art Swin Transformers for 6
different object detection methods trained with standard 1x and 3x schedules.
Our largest Focal Transformer yields 58.7/58.9 box mAPs and 50.9/51.3 mask mAPs
on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and 55.4 mIoU on ADE20K for semantic segmentation,

                                        <span>Deep learning models generally learn the biases present in the training data.
Researchers have proposed several approaches to mitigate such biases and make
the model fair. Bias mitigation techniques assume that a sufficiently large
number of training examples are present. However, we observe that if the
training data is limited, then the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods is
severely degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this
problem. Specifically, we adapt self-supervision and self-distillation to
reduce the impact of biases on the model in this setting. Self-supervision and
self-distillation are not used for bias mitigation. However, through this work,
we demonstrate for the first time that these techniques are very effective in
bias mitigation. We empirically show that our approach can significantly reduce
the biases learned by the model. Further, we experimentally demonstrate that
our approach is complementary to other bias mitigation strategies. Our approach
significantly improves their performance and further reduces the model biases
in the limited data regime. Specifically, on the L-CIFAR-10S skewed dataset,
our approach significantly reduces the bias score of the baseline model by
78.22% and outperforms it in terms of accuracy by a significant absolute margin
of 8.89%. It also significantly reduces the bias score for the state-of-the-art
domain independent bias mitigation method by 59.26% and improves its
performance by a significant absolute margin of 7.08%.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance
with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning
interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of
self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which
makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required.
In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually
simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term
spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our
architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision transformers with
three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise
multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters,
and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity
trade-offs of our models on both ImageNet and downstream tasks. Our results
demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to
transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and
robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/GFNet</span>

However, the lack of access a to large-scale annotated dataset poses a great
challenge, especially in the case of rare diseases, or new domains for the
research society. Transfer of pre-trained features, from the relatively large
dataset is a considerable solution. In this paper, we have explored supervised
segmentation using domain adaptation for optic nerve and orbital tumor, when
only small sampled CT images are given. Even the lung image database consortium
image collection (LIDC-IDRI) is a cross-domain to orbital CT, but the proposed
domain adaptation method improved the performance of attention U-Net for the
segmentation in public optic nerve dataset and our clinical orbital tumor

                                        <span>The current practice in land cover/land use change analysis relies heavily on
the individually classified maps of the multitemporal data set. Due to varying
acquisition conditions (e.g., illumination, sensors, seasonal differences), the
classification maps yielded are often inconsistent through time for robust
statistical analysis. 3D geometric features have been shown to be stable for
assessing differences across the temporal data set. Therefore, in this article
we investigate he use of a multitemporal orthophoto and digital surface model
derived from satellite data for spatiotemporal classification. Our approach
consists of two major steps: generating per-class probability distribution maps
using the random-forest classifier with limited training samples, and making
spatiotemporal inferences using an iterative 3D spatiotemporal filter operating
on per-class probability maps. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods can consistently improve the individual classification results
by 2%-6% and thus can be an important postclassification refinement approach.</span>

three parts, the backbone network, the temporal attention module, and the
classification module. Specifically, the Channel-Separated Convolutional
Network (CSN) is used as the backbone network to extract features, and the
temporal attention module is designed to enforce the network to focus on the
discriminative features. After that, the cascaded architecture is used in the
classification module to generate more accurate boundaries. In addition, the
ensemble strategy is used to further improve the performance of the proposed

of view than others. This intrinsic selectivity mechanism, so-called visual
attention, is influenced by both high- and low-level factors; such as the
global environment (illumination, background texture, etc.), stimulus
characteristics (color, intensity, orientation, etc.), and some prior visual
information. Visual attention is useful for many computer vision applications
such as image compression, recognition, and captioning. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end deep-based method, so-called SALYPATH (SALiencY and
scanPATH), that efficiently predicts the scanpath of an image through features
of a saliency model. The idea is predict the scanpath by exploiting the
capacity of a deep-based model to predict the saliency. The proposed method was

                                        <span>Training deep neural networks with an $L_0$ regularization is one of the
prominent approaches for network pruning or sparsification. The method prunes
the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero.
However, recent work of Gale et al. reveals that although this method yields
high compression rates on smaller datasets, it performs inconsistently on
large-scale learning tasks, such as ResNet50 on ImageNet. We analyze this
phenomenon through the lens of variational inference and find that it is likely
due to the independent modeling of binary gates, the mean-field approximation,
which is known in Bayesian statistics for its poor performance due to the crude
approximation. To mitigate this deficiency, we propose a dependency modeling of
binary gates, which can be modeled effectively as a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). We term our algorithm Dep-$L_0$ as it prunes networks via a
dependency-enabled $L_0$ regularization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10,
CIFAR100 and ImageNet with VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet56 show that our Dep-$L_0$
outperforms the original $L_0$-HC algorithm of Louizos et al. by a significant
margin, especially on ImageNet. Compared with the state-of-the-arts network
sparsification algorithms, our dependency modeling makes the $L_0$-based
sparsification once again very competitive on large-scale learning tasks. Our

reliance on established multiple-testing correction mechanisms as well as the

                                        <span>This paper proposes a lossless point cloud (PC) geometry compression method
that uses neural networks to estimate the probability distribution of voxel
occupancy. First, to take into account the PC sparsity, our method adaptively
partitions a point cloud into multiple voxel block sizes. This partitioning is
signalled via an octree. Second, we employ a deep auto-regressive generative
model to estimate the occupancy probability of each voxel given the previously
encoded ones. We then employ the estimated probabilities to code efficiently a
block using a context-based arithmetic coder. Our context has variable size and
can expand beyond the current block to learn more accurate probabilities. We
also consider using data augmentation techniques to increase the generalization
capability of the learned probability models, in particular in the presence of
noise and lower-density point clouds. Experimental evaluation, performed on a
variety of point clouds from four different datasets and with diverse
characteristics, demonstrates that our method reduces significantly (by up to
30%) the rate for lossless coding compared to the state-of-the-art MPEG codec.</span>

fields of machine learning and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The focus has mainly
been on per-frame classification. More recently, polyp segmentation has gained
attention in the medical community. Segmentation has the advantage of being
more accurate than per-frame classification or object detection as it can show
the affected area in greater detail. For our contribution to the EndoCV 2021
segmentation challenge, we propose two separate approaches. First, a
segmentation model named TriUNet composed of three separate UNet models.
Second, we combine TriUNet with an ensemble of well-known segmentation models,
namely UNet++, FPN, DeepLabv3, and DeepLabv3+, into a model called
DivergentNets to produce more generalizable medical image segmentation masks.
In addition, we propose a modified Dice loss that calculates loss only for a
single class when performing multiclass segmentation, forcing the model to
focus on what is most important. Overall, the proposed methods achieved the
best average scores for each respective round in the challenge, with TriUNet
being the winning model in Round I and DivergentNets being the winning model in
Round II of the segmentation generalization challenge at EndoCV 2021. The
implementation of our approach is made publicly available on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Driven by recent advances in object detection with deep neural networks, the
tracking-by-detection paradigm has gained increasing prevalence in the research
community of multi-object tracking (MOT). It has long been known that
appearance information plays an essential role in the detection-to-track
association, which lies at the core of the tracking-by-detection paradigm.
While most existing works consider the appearance distances between the
detections and the tracks, they ignore the statistical information implied by
the historical appearance distance records in the tracks, which can be
particularly useful when a detection has similar distances with two or more
tracks. In this work, we propose a hybrid track association (HTA) algorithm
that models the historical appearance distances of a track with an incremental
Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) and incorporates the derived statistical
information into the calculation of the detection-to-track association cost.
Experimental results on three MOT benchmarks confirm that HTA effectively
improves the target identification performance with a small compromise to the
tracking speed. Additionally, compared to many state-of-the-art trackers, the
DeepSORT tracker equipped with HTA achieves better or comparable performance in
terms of the balance of tracking quality and speed.</span>

context of the industrial world. A common and hard to detect challenge in
machine learning (ML) tasks is data bias. In this work, we present a systematic
approach to uncover data bias by means of attribution maps. For this purpose,
first an artificial dataset with a known bias is created and used to train
intentionally biased CNNs. The networks&#x27; decisions are then inspected using
attribution maps. Finally, meaningful metrics are used to measure the

                                        <span>Previous works indicate that the glyph of Chinese characters contains rich
semantic information and has the potential to enhance the representation of
Chinese characters. The typical method to utilize the glyph features is by
incorporating them into the character embedding space. Inspired by previous
methods, we innovatively propose a Chinese pre-trained representation model
named as GlyphCRM, which abandons the ID-based character embedding method yet
solely based on sequential character images. We render each character into a
binary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it.
Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network,
namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese
characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer
blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information.
Meanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph
module into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to
fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module
can obtain a sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the
long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. Extensive
experimental results indicate that GlyphCRM substantially outperforms the
previous BERT-based state-of-the-art model on 9 fine-tuning tasks, and it has
strong transferability and generalization on specialized fields and
low-resource tasks. We hope this work could spark further research beyond the
realms of well-established representation of Chinese texts.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding the reasons behind the predictions made by deep neural networks
is critical for gaining human trust in many important applications, which is
reflected in the increasing demand for explainability in AI (XAI) in recent
years. Saliency-based feature attribution methods, which highlight important
parts of images that contribute to decisions by classifiers, are often used as
XAI methods, especially in the field of computer vision. In order to compare
various saliency-based XAI methods quantitatively, several approaches for
automated evaluation schemes have been proposed; however, there is no guarantee
that such automated evaluation metrics correctly evaluate explainability, and a
high rating by an automated evaluation scheme does not necessarily mean a high
explainability for humans. In this study, instead of the automated evaluation,
we propose a new human-based evaluation scheme using crowdsourcing to evaluate
XAI methods. Our method is inspired by a human computation game, &quot;Peek-a-boom&quot;,
and can efficiently compare different XAI methods by exploiting the power of
crowds. We evaluate the saliency maps of various XAI methods on two datasets
with automated and crowd-based evaluation schemes. Our experiments show that
the result of our crowd-based evaluation scheme is different from those of
automated evaluation schemes. In addition, we regard the crowd-based evaluation
results as ground truths and provide a quantitative performance measure to
compare different automated evaluation schemes. We also discuss the impact of
crowd workers on the results and show that the varying ability of crowd workers
does not significantly impact the results.</span>

contact with each other. Due to the homogeneous appearance of hands, this makes
estimating the 3D pose of interacting hands from images difficult. In this
paper we demonstrate that self-similarity, and the resulting ambiguities in
assigning pixel observations to the respective hands and their parts, is a
major cause of the final 3D pose error. Motivated by this insight, we propose
DIGIT, a novel method for estimating the 3D poses of two interacting hands from
a single monocular image. The method consists of two interwoven branches that
process the input imagery into a per-pixel semantic part segmentation mask and
a visual feature volume. In contrast to prior work, we do not decouple the
segmentation from the pose estimation stage, but rather leverage the per-pixel
probabilities directly in the downstream pose estimation task. To do so, the
part probabilities are merged with the visual features and processed via
fully-convolutional layers. We experimentally show that the proposed approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the InterHand2.6M dataset for both
single and interacting hands across all metrics. We provide detailed ablation
studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method and to provide insights into
how the modelling of pixel ownership affects single and interacting hand pose
estimation. Our code will be released for research purposes.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose an Omni-perception Pre-Trainer (OPT) for
cross-modal understanding and generation, by jointly modeling visual, text and
audio resources. OPT is constructed in an encoder-decoder framework, including
three single-modal encoders to generate token-based embeddings for each
modality, a cross-modal encoder to encode the correlations among the three
modalities, and two cross-modal decoders to generate text and image
respectively. For the OPT&#x27;s pre-training, we design a multi-task pretext
learning scheme to model multi-modal resources from three different data
granularities, \ie, token-, modality-, and sample-level modeling, through which
OPT learns to align and translate among different modalities. The pre-training
task is carried out on a large amount of image-text-audio triplets from Open
Images. Experimental results show that OPT can learn strong image-text-audio
multi-modal representations and achieve promising results on a variety of
cross-modal understanding and generation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Human motion prediction is an essential component for enabling closer
human-robot collaboration. The task of accurately predicting human motion is
non-trivial. It is compounded by the variability of human motion, both at a
skeletal level due to the varying size of humans and at a motion level due to
individual movement&#x27;s idiosyncrasies. These variables make it challenging for
learning algorithms to obtain a general representation that is robust to the
diverse spatio-temporal patterns of human motion. In this work, we propose a
modular sequence learning approach that allows end-to-end training while also
having the flexibility of being fine-tuned. Our approach relies on the
diversity of training samples to first learn a robust representation, which can
then be fine-tuned in a continual learning setup to predict the motion of new
subjects. We evaluated the proposed approach by comparing its performance
against state-of-the-art baselines. The results suggest that our approach
outperforms other methods over all the evaluated temporal horizons, using a
small amount of data for fine-tuning. The improved performance of our approach
opens up the possibility of using continual learning for personalized and
reliable motion prediction.</span>

a deep image segmentation network using particularly weak train-time
annotations: only 6 extreme clicks at the boundary of the objects of interest.
Our fully-automatic method is trained end-to-end and does not require any
test-time annotations. From the extreme points, 3D bounding boxes are extracted
around objects of interest. Then, deep geodesics connecting extreme points are
generated to increase the amount of &quot;annotated&quot; voxels within the bounding
boxes. Finally, a weakly supervised regularised loss derived from a Conditional
Random Field formulation is used to encourage prediction consistency over
homogeneous regions. Extensive experiments are performed on a large open
dataset for Vestibular Schwannoma segmentation. $\textit{InExtremIS}$ obtained
competitive performance, approaching full supervision and outperforming
significantly other weakly supervised techniques based on bounding boxes.
Moreover, given a fixed annotation time budget, $\textit{InExtremIS}$

without directly sharing data within each device, thus preserving privacy and
eliminating the need to store data globally. While there are promising results
under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (iid) local
data, current state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from performance degradation
as the heterogeneity of local data across clients increases. To resolve this
issue, we propose a simple framework, Mean Augmented Federated Learning (MAFL),
where clients send and receive averaged local data, subject to the privacy
requirements of target applications. Under our framework, we propose a new
augmentation algorithm, named FedMix, which is inspired by a phenomenal yet
simple data augmentation method, Mixup, but does not require local raw data to
be directly shared among devices. Our method shows greatly improved performance
in the standard benchmark datasets of FL, under highly non-iid federated
settings, compared to conventional algorithms.</span>

learning, exciting progress has been made recently. Despite achieving better
compression performance, existing end-to-end compression algorithms are still
designed towards better signal quality in terms of rate-distortion
optimization. In this paper, we show that the design and optimization of
network architecture could be further improved for compression towards machine
vision. We propose an inverted bottleneck structure for end-to-end compression
towards machine vision, which specifically accounts for efficient
representation of the semantic information. Moreover, we quest the capability
of optimization by incorporating the analytics accuracy into the optimization
process, and the optimality is further explored with generalized rate-accuracy
optimization in an iterative manner. We use object detection as a showcase for
end-to-end compression towards machine vision, and extensive experiments show
that the proposed scheme achieves significant BD-rate savings in terms of
analysis performance. Moreover, the promise of the scheme is also demonstrated
with strong generalization capability towards other machine vision tasks, due
to the enabling of signal-level reconstruction.</span>

label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few
explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch&#x27;s Postulates, the
foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we
propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical
diagnosis. By determining and isolating the neuron activation patterns on which
diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector relies to make decisions, we demonstrate the
direct relation between the isolated neuron activation and lesions for a
pathological explanation. To be specific, we first define novel pathological
descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial
and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded
in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically
plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even
arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated
lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly
related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both
qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods.
Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our
second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data
augmentation.</span>

model after another takes the place of the state-of-the-art on the Kinetics
dataset, but real-world efficiency evaluations are often lacking. In this work,
we fill this gap and investigate the use of transformers for efficient action
recognition. We propose a novel, lightweight action recognition architecture,
VideoLightFormer. In a factorized fashion, we carefully extend the 2D
convolutional Temporal Segment Network with transformers, while maintaining
spatial and temporal video structure throughout the entire model. Existing
methods often resort to one of the two extremes, where they either apply huge
transformers to video features, or minimal transformers on highly pooled video
features. Our method differs from them by keeping the transformer models small,
but leveraging full spatiotemporal feature structure. We evaluate
VideoLightFormer in a high-efficiency setting on the temporally-demanding
EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Something-Something-V2 (SSV2) datasets and find that it
achieves a better mix of efficiency and accuracy than existing state-of-the-art
models, apart from the Temporal Shift Module on SSV2.</span>

                                        <span>Place recognition gives a SLAM system the ability to correct cumulative
errors. Unlike images that contain rich texture features, point clouds are
almost pure geometric information which makes place recognition based on point
clouds challenging. Existing works usually encode low-level features such as
coordinate, normal, reflection intensity, etc., as local or global descriptors
to represent scenes. Besides, they often ignore the translation between point
clouds when matching descriptors. Different from most existing methods, we
explore the use of high-level features, namely semantics, to improve the
descriptor&#x27;s representation ability. Also, when matching descriptors, we try to
correct the translation between point clouds to improve accuracy. Concretely,
we propose a novel global descriptor, Semantic Scan Context, which explores
semantic information to represent scenes more effectively. We also present a
two-step global semantic ICP to obtain the 3D pose (x, y, yaw) used to align
the point cloud to improve matching performance. Our experiments on the KITTI
dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a
large margin. Our code is available at: https://github.com/lilin-hitcrt/SSC.</span>

                                        <span>Identity documents recognition is an important sub-field of document
analysis, which deals with tasks of robust document detection, type
identification, text fields recognition, as well as identity fraud prevention
and document authenticity validation given photos, scans, or video frames of an
identity document capture. Significant amount of research has been published on
this topic in recent years, however a chief difficulty for such research is
scarcity of datasets, due to the subject matter being protected by security
requirements. A few datasets of identity documents which are available lack
diversity of document types, capturing conditions, or variability of document
field values. In addition, the published datasets were typically designed only
for a subset of document recognition problems, not for a complex identity
document analysis. In this paper, we present a dataset MIDV-2020 which consists
of 1000 video clips, 2000 scanned images, and 1000 photos of 1000 unique mock
identity documents, each with unique text field values and unique artificially
generated faces, with rich annotation. For the presented benchmark dataset
baselines are provided for such tasks as document location and identification,
text fields recognition, and face detection. With 72409 annotated images in
total, to the date of publication the proposed dataset is the largest publicly
available identity documents dataset with variable artificially generated data,
and we believe that it will prove invaluable for advancement of the field of
document analysis and recognition. The dataset is available for download at
this ftp URL and this http URL .</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a new dataset for the emotional artificial intelligence
research: identity-free video dataset for Micro-Gesture Understanding and
Emotion analysis (iMiGUE). Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE
focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information,
while the predominant researches of emotion analysis concern sensitive
biometric data, like face and speech. Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on
micro-gestures, i.e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which
are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which
are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore,
iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional
states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just
recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is
because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states
behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of
imbalanced sample distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method
is proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences
themselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this
dataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting
insights from the iMiGUE, e.g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote
emotion understanding. We confirm that the new iMiGUE dataset could advance
studies of micro-gesture and emotion AI.</span>

                                        <span>Benefiting from the powerful expressive capability of graphs, graph-based
approaches have achieved impressive performance in various biomedical
applications. Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among
samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings
for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not
easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the
complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these
factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about
the patient&#x27;s condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction.
To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated
with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate
the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity
between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix
manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured
through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized
with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among
samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable
to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group
of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed
and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In
addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide
more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and
inspiration for disease research.</span>

                                        <span>Processing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly
task, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Therefore, Ai has
become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a
supportive tool for doctors. AI tools highly depend on data for training the
models. However, there are several constraints to access to large amounts of
medical data to train machine learning algorithms in the medical domain, e.g.,
due to privacy concerns and the costly, time-consuming medical data annotation
process. To address this, in this paper we present a novel synthetic data
generation pipeline called SinGAN-Seg to produce synthetic medical data with
the corresponding annotated ground truth masks. We show that these synthetic
data generation pipelines can be used as an alternative to bypass privacy
concerns and as an alternative way to produce artificial segmentation datasets
with corresponding ground truth masks to avoid the tedious medical data
annotation process. As a proof of concept, we used an open polyp segmentation
dataset. By training UNet++ using both the real polyp segmentation dataset and
the corresponding synthetic dataset generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we
show that the synthetic data can achieve a very close performance to the real
data when the real segmentation datasets are large enough. In addition, we show
that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improving the
performance of segmentation algorithms when the training dataset is very small.
Since our SinGAN-Seg pipeline is applicable for any medical dataset, this
pipeline can be used with any other segmentation datasets.</span>

high-dimensional inputs from multiple modalities such as vision and audio.
Machine perception models, in stark contrast, are typically modality-specific
and optimised for unimodal benchmarks, and hence late-stage fusion of final
representations or predictions from each modality (&#x60;late-fusion&#x27;) is still a
dominant paradigm for multimodal video classification. Instead, we introduce a
novel transformer based architecture that uses &#x60;fusion bottlenecks&#x27; for
modality fusion at multiple layers. Compared to traditional pairwise
self-attention, our model forces information between different modalities to
pass through a small number of bottleneck latents, requiring the model to
collate and condense the most relevant information in each modality and only
share what is necessary. We find that such a strategy improves fusion
performance, at the same time reducing computational cost. We conduct thorough
ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple audio-visual
classification benchmarks including Audioset, Epic-Kitchens and VGGSound. All
code and models will be released.</span>

such as seeking clarifications about the question, taking advantage of clues,
abstaining in order to avoid incorrect answers, etc. This difference in task
formulation hinders the adoption of NLP systems in real-world settings. In this
work, we take a step towards bridging this gap and present a multi-stage task
that simulates a typical human-human questioner-responder interaction such as
an interview. Specifically, the system is provided with question
simplifications, knowledge statements, examples, etc. at various stages to
improve its prediction when it is not sufficiently confident. We instantiate
the proposed task in Natural Language Inference setting where a system is
evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and find that the multi-stage formulation of our task
leads to OOD generalization performance improvement up to 2.29% in Stage 1,
1.91% in Stage 2, 54.88% in Stage 3, and 72.02% in Stage 4 over the standard
unguided prediction. However, our task leaves a significant challenge for NLP
researchers to further improve OOD performance at each stage.</span>

implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial
attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a
misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet
efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event
sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters
for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two
types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the
filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks.
Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware
Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset
and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean

                                        <span>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from
a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally
attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between
the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher
model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to
mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits
the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper,
we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework
(IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and
exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer
the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model,
while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different
from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is
generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual
learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn
more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general
technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance.
Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the
performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning. The code and
models of IE-KD will be make publicly available at
https://github.com/yellowtownhz/IE-KD.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a proof of concept for the usefulness of second-order
texture features for the qualitative analysis and classification of chromogenic
in-situ hybridization whole slide images in high-throughput imaging
experiments. The challenge is that currently, the gold standard for gene
expression grading in such images is expert assessment. The idea of the
research team is to use different approaches in the analysis of these images
that will be used for structural segmentation and functional analysis in gene
expression. The article presents such perspective idea to select a number of
textural features that are going to be used for classification. In our
experiment, natural grouping of image samples (tiles) depending on their local
texture properties was explored in an unsupervised classification procedure.
The features are reduced to two dimensions with fuzzy c-means clustering. The
overall conclusion of this experiment is that Haralick features are a viable
choice for classification and analysis of chromogenic in-situ hybridization
image data. The principal component analysis approach produced slightly more
&quot;understandable&quot; from an annotator&#x27;s point of view classes.</span>

                                        <span>Swarms of drones are being more and more used in many practical scenarios,
such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, search and rescue in
hardly-accessible areas, etc.. While a single drone can be guided by a human
operator, the deployment of a swarm of multiple drones requires proper
algorithms for automatic task-oriented control. In this paper, we focus on
visual coverage optimization with drone-mounted camera sensors. In particular,
we consider the specific case in which the coverage requirements are uneven,
meaning that different parts of the environment have different coverage
priorities. We model these coverage requirements with relevance maps and
propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to guide the swarm. The paper
first defines a proper learning model for a single drone, and then extends it
to the case of multiple drones both with greedy and cooperative strategies.
Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method, also compared
with a standard patrolling algorithm.</span>

experiment setup and criteria for identifying the &quot;winning ticket&quot; in
literature. To reconcile such, we revisit the definition of lottery ticket
hypothesis, with comprehensive and more rigorous conditions. Under our new
definition, we show concrete evidence to clarify whether the winning ticket
exists across the major DNN architectures and/or applications. Through
extensive experiments, we perform quantitative analysis on the correlations
between winning tickets and various experimental factors, and empirically study
the patterns of our observations. We find that the key training
hyperparameters, such as learning rate and training epochs, as well as the
architecture characteristics such as capacities and residual connections, are
all highly correlated with whether and when the winning tickets can be
identified. Based on our analysis, we summarize a guideline for parameter
settings in regards of specific architecture characteristics, which we hope to
catalyze the research progress on the topic of lottery ticket hypothesis.</span>

                                        <span>While many real-world data streams imply that they change frequently in a
nonstationary way, most of deep learning methods optimize neural networks on
training data, and this leads to severe performance degradation when dataset
shift happens. However, it is less possible to annotate or inspect newly
streamed data by humans, and thus it is desired to measure model drift at
inference time in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a novel
method of model drift estimation by exploiting statistics of batch
normalization layer on unlabeled test data. To remedy possible sampling error
of streamed input data, we adopt low-rank approximation to each
representational layer. We show the effectiveness of our method not only on
dataset shift detection but also on model selection when there are multiple
candidate models among model zoo or training trajectories in an unsupervised
way. We further demonstrate the consistency of our method by comparing model
drift scores between different network architectures.</span>

                                        <span>In real-world applications, data often come in a growing manner, where the
data volume and the number of classes may increase dynamically. This will bring
a critical challenge for learning: given the increasing data volume or the
number of classes, one has to instantaneously adjust the neural model capacity
to obtain promising performance. Existing methods either ignore the growing
nature of data or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a
given dataset, and thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures
for the changed data. To address this, we present a neural architecture
adaptation method, namely Adaptation eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust
previous architectures on the growing data. Specifically, we introduce an
architecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture for each data
snapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent between
current and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation
condition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding
unnecessary and time-consuming adjustments. Extensive experiments on two growth
scenarios (increasing data volume and number of classes) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

networks on an octree data representation. We train a hierarchy of neural
networks, each capable of 2x upscaling in each spatial dimension between two
levels of detail, and use these networks in tandem to facilitate large scale
factor super resolution, scaling with the number of trained networks. We
utilize these networks in a hierarchical super resolution algorithm that
upscales multiresolution data to a uniform high resolution without introducing
seam artifacts on octree node boundaries. We evaluate application of this
algorithm in a data reduction framework by dynamically downscaling input data
to an octree-based data structure to represent the multiresolution data before
compressing for additional storage reduction. We demonstrate that our approach
avoids seam artifacts common to multiresolution data formats, and show how
neural network super resolution assisted data reduction can preserve global

EPIC-Kitchens-100 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) Challenge in Action
Recognition. To tackle the domain-shift which exists under the UDA setting, we
first exploited a recent Domain Generalization (DG) technique, called Relative
Norm Alignment (RNA). It consists in designing a model able to generalize well
to any unseen domain, regardless of the possibility to access target data at
training time. Then, in a second phase, we extended the approach to work on
unlabelled target data, allowing the model to adapt to the target distribution
in an unsupervised fashion. For this purpose, we included in our framework
existing UDA algorithms, such as Temporal Attentive Adversarial Adaptation
Network (TA3N), jointly with new multi-stream consistency losses, namely
Temporal Hard Norm Alignment (T-HNA) and Min-Entropy Consistency (MEC). Our
submission (entry &#x27;plnet&#x27;) is visible on the leaderboard and it achieved the
1st position for &#x27;verb&#x27;, and the 3rd position for both &#x27;noun&#x27; and &#x27;action&#x27;.</span>

                                        <span>Modern top-performing object detectors depend heavily on backbone networks,
whose advances bring consistent performance gains through exploring more
effective network structures. However, designing or searching for a new
backbone and pre-training it on ImageNet may require a large number of
computational resources, making it costly to obtain better detection
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel backbone network, namely
CBNetV2, by constructing compositions of existing open-sourced pre-trained
backbones. In particular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple identical
backbones, which are connected through composite connections. We also propose a
better training strategy with the Assistant Supervision for CBNet-based
detectors. Without additional pre-training, CBNetV2 can be integrated into
mainstream detectors, including one-stage and two-stage detectors, as well as
anchor-based and anchor-free-based ones, and significantly improve their
performance by more than 3.0% AP over the baseline on COCO. Also, experiments
provide strong evidence showing that composite backbones are more efficient and
resource-friendly than pre-trained wider and deeper networks, including
manual-based and NAS-based, as well as CNN-based and Transformer-based ones.
Particularly, with single-model and single-scale testing, our HTC Dual-Swin-B
achieves 58.6% box AP and 51.1% mask AP on COCO test-dev, which is
significantly better than the state-of-the-art result (i.e., 57.7% box AP and
50.2% mask AP) achieved by a stronger baseline HTC++ with a larger backbone
Swin-L. Code will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/CBNetV2.</span>

                                        <span>Reconstructing the scene of robotic surgery from the stereo endoscopic video
is an important and promising topic in surgical data science, which potentially
supports many applications such as surgical visual perception, robotic surgery
education and intra-operative context awareness. However, current methods are
mostly restricted to reconstructing static anatomy assuming no tissue
deformation, tool occlusion and de-occlusion, and camera movement. However,
these assumptions are not always satisfied in minimal invasive robotic
surgeries. In this work, we present an efficient reconstruction pipeline for
highly dynamic surgical scenes that runs at 28 fps. Specifically, we design a
transformer-based stereoscopic depth perception for efficient depth estimation
and a light-weight tool segmentor to handle tool occlusion. After that, a
dynamic reconstruction algorithm which can estimate the tissue deformation and
camera movement, and aggregate the information over time is proposed for
surgical scene reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on two
datasets, the public Hamlyn Centre Endoscopic Video Dataset and our in-house
DaVinci robotic surgery dataset. The results demonstrate that our method can
recover the scene obstructed by the surgical tool and handle the movement of
camera in realistic surgical scenarios effectively at real-time speed.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, deep hashing with Hamming distance metric has drawn increasing
attention for face image retrieval tasks. However, its counterpart deep
quantization methods, which learn binary code representations with
dictionary-related distance metrics, have seldom been explored for the task.
This paper makes the first attempt to integrate product quantization into an
end-to-end deep learning framework for face image retrieval. Unlike prior deep
quantization methods where the codewords for quantization are learned from
data, we propose a novel scheme using predefined orthonormal vectors as
codewords, which aims to enhance the quantization informativeness and reduce
the codewords&#x27; redundancy. To make the most of the discriminative information,
we design a tailored loss function that maximizes the identity discriminability
in each quantization subspace for both the quantized and the original features.
Furthermore, an entropy-based regularization term is imposed to reduce the
quantization error. We conduct experiments on three commonly-used datasets
under the settings of both single-domain and cross-domain retrieval. It shows
that the proposed method outperforms all the compared deep hashing/quantization
methods under both settings with significant superiority. The proposed
codewords scheme consistently improves both regular model performance and model
generalization ability, verifying the importance of codewords&#x27; distribution for
the quantization quality. Besides, our model&#x27;s better generalization ability
than deep hashing models indicates that it is more suitable for scalable face
image retrieval tasks.</span>

3D hybrid scenes under the framework of zero-shot learning. Here by hybrid, we
mean the scene consists of both seen-class and unseen-class 3D objects, a more
general and realistic setting in application. To our knowledge, this problem
has not been explored in the literature. To this end, we propose a network to
synthesize point features for various classes of objects by leveraging the
semantic features of both seen and unseen object classes, called PFNet. The
proposed PFNet employs a GAN architecture to synthesize point features, where
the semantic relationship between seen-class and unseen-class features is
consolidated by adapting a new semantic regularizer, and the synthesized
features are used to train a classifier for predicting the labels of the
testing 3D scene points. Besides we also introduce two benchmarks for
algorithmic evaluation by re-organizing the public S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
under six different data splits. Experimental results on the two benchmarks
validate our proposed method, and we hope our introduced two benchmarks and

methods. In this paper, we methodically evaluate a variety of these techniques
to understand where most of the improvements in modern detection systems come

RetinaNet and RCNN detectors. The vanilla detectors are improved by 7.7% in

strategies to generate family of models that form two Pareto curves, named

                                        <span>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a strong classifier using limited
labeled examples. Many existing works take the meta-learning approach, sampling
few-shot tasks in turn and optimizing the few-shot learner&#x27;s performance on
classifying the query examples. In this paper, we point out two potential
weaknesses of this approach. First, the sampled query examples may not provide
sufficient supervision for the few-shot learner. Second, the effectiveness of
meta-learning diminishes sharply with increasing shots (i.e., the number of
training examples per class). To resolve these issues, we propose a novel
objective to directly train the few-shot learner to perform like a strong
classifier. Concretely, we associate each sampled few-shot task with a strong
classifier, which is learned with ample labeled examples. The strong classifier
has a better generalization ability and we use it to supervise the few-shot
learner. We present an efficient way to construct the strong classifier, making
our proposed objective an easily plug-and-play term to existing meta-learning
based FSL methods. We validate our approach in combinations with many
representative meta-learning methods. On several benchmark datasets including
miniImageNet and tiredImageNet, our approach leads to a notable improvement
across a variety of tasks. More importantly, with our approach, meta-learning
based FSL methods can consistently outperform non-meta-learning based ones,
even in a many-shot setting, greatly strengthening their applicability.</span>

                                        <span>We study computational hardness of feature and conjunction search through the
lens of circuit complexity. Let $x &#x3D; (x_1, ... , x_n)$ (resp., $y &#x3D; (y_1, ... ,
y_n)$) be Boolean variables each of which takes the value one if and only if a
neuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply
formulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\rm
FTR}_n(x) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i$ and ${\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i
\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).

We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed &#x3D; o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.</span>

                                        <span>Camera-based passive dietary intake monitoring is able to continuously
capture the eating episodes of a subject, recording rich visual information,
such as the type and volume of food being consumed, as well as the eating
behaviours of the subject. However, there currently is no method that is able
to incorporate these visual clues and provide a comprehensive context of
dietary intake from passive recording (e.g., is the subject sharing food with
others, what food the subject is eating, and how much food is left in the
bowl). On the other hand, privacy is a major concern while egocentric wearable
cameras are used for capturing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserved
secure solution (i.e., egocentric image captioning) for dietary assessment with
passive monitoring, which unifies food recognition, volume estimation, and
scene understanding. By converting images into rich text descriptions,
nutritionists can assess individual dietary intake based on the captions
instead of the original images, reducing the risk of privacy leakage from
images. To this end, an egocentric dietary image captioning dataset has been
built, which consists of in-the-wild images captured by head-worn and
chest-worn cameras in field studies in Ghana. A novel transformer-based
architecture is designed to caption egocentric dietary images. Comprehensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify
the design of the proposed architecture for egocentric dietary image
captioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies
image captioning to dietary intake assessment in real life settings.</span>

problems, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of machine learning
and deep learning for the analysis of digital pathology and biopsy image
patches. However, traditional learning over patch-wise features using
convolutional neural networks limits the model when attempting to capture
global contextual information. The phenotypical and topological distribution of
constituent histological entities play a critical role in tissue diagnosis. As
such, graph data representations and deep learning have attracted significant
attention for encoding tissue representations, and capturing intra- and inter-
entity level interactions. In this review, we provide a conceptual grounding of
graph-based deep learning and discuss its current success for tumor
localization and classification, tumor invasion and staging, image retrieval,
and survival prediction. We provide an overview of these methods in a
systematic manner organized by the graph representation of the input image
including whole slide images and tissue microarrays. We also outline the
limitations of existing techniques, and suggest potential future advances in
this domain.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to align the labeled source
distribution with the unlabeled target distribution to obtain domain invariant
predictive models. However, the application of well-known UDA approaches does
not generalize well in Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) scenarios where
few labeled samples from the target domain are available. In this paper, we
propose a simple Contrastive Learning framework for semi-supervised Domain
Adaptation (CLDA) that attempts to bridge the intra-domain gap between the
labeled and unlabeled target distributions and inter-domain gap between source
and unlabeled target distribution in SSDA. We suggest employing class-wise
contrastive learning to reduce the inter-domain gap and instance-level
contrastive alignment between the original (input image) and strongly augmented
unlabeled target images to minimize the intra-domain discrepancy. We have shown
empirically that both of these modules complement each other to achieve
superior performance. Experiments on three well-known domain adaptation
benchmark datasets namely DomainNet, Office-Home, and Office31 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. CLDA achieves state-of-the-art results on all
the above datasets.</span>

for selection of most informative frames (key frames) of an endoscopic video.
In most of the cases, ground truth depth maps of polyps are not readily
available and that is why the transfer learning approach is adopted in our
method. An endoscopic modalities generally capture thousands of frames. In this
scenario, it is quite important to discard low-quality and clinically
irrelevant frames of an endoscopic video while the most informative frames
should be retained for clinical diagnosis. In this view, a key-frame selection
strategy is proposed by utilizing the depth information of polyps. In our
method, image moment, edge magnitude, and key-points are considered for
adaptively selecting the key frames. One important application of our proposed
method could be the 3D reconstruction of polyps with the help of extracted key

autonomous driving. Recently, inspiring results have been shown with CNN-based
methods which provide a direct formulation to end-to-end regress 6-DoF absolute
pose. Additional information like geometric or semantic constraints is
generally introduced to improve performance. Especially, the latter can
aggregate high-level semantic information into localization task, but it
usually requires enormous manual annotations. To this end, we propose a novel
auxiliary learning strategy for camera localization by introducing
scene-specific high-level semantics from self-supervised representation
learning task. Viewed as a powerful proxy task, image colorization task is
chosen as complementary task that outputs pixel-wise color version of grayscale
photograph without extra annotations. In our work, feature representations from
colorization network are embedded into localization network by design to
produce discriminative features for pose regression. Meanwhile an attention
mechanism is introduced for the benefit of localization performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model significantly improve localization accuracy

is important for quality control. For example, a steel sheet is extremely
delicate, and must be accurately inspected. However, to maintain the painted
steel parts of the infrastructure around a severe outdoor environment,
corrosion detection is critical for predictive maintenance. In this paper, we
propose a general-purpose application for steel anomaly detection that consists
of the following four components. The first, a learner, is a unit image
classification network to determine whether the region of interest or
background has been recognised, after dividing the original large sized image
into 256 square unit images. The second, an extractor, is a discriminator
feature encoder based on a pre-trained steel generator with a patch generative
adversarial network discriminator(GAN). The third, an anomaly detector, is a
one-class support vector machine(SVM) to predict the anomaly score using the
discriminator feature. The fourth, an indicator, is an anomalous probability
map used to visually explain the anomalous features. Furthermore, we
demonstrated our method through the inspection of steel sheet defects with
13,774 unit images using high-speed cameras, and painted steel corrosion with
19,766 unit images based on an eye inspection of the photographs. Finally, we
visualise anomalous feature maps of steel using a strip and painted steel
inspection dataset</span>

                                        <span>At the heart of all automated driving systems is the ability to sense the
surroundings, e.g., through semantic segmentation of LiDAR sequences, which
experienced a remarkable progress due to the release of large datasets such as
SemanticKITTI and nuScenes-LidarSeg. While most previous works focus on sparse
segmentation of the LiDAR input, dense output masks provide self-driving cars
with almost complete environment information. In this paper, we introduce MASS
- a Multi-Attentional Semantic Segmentation model specifically built for dense
top-view understanding of the driving scenes. Our framework operates on pillar-
and occupancy features and comprises three attention-based building blocks: (1)
a keypoint-driven graph attention, (2) an LSTM-based attention computed from a
vector embedding of the spatial input, and (3) a pillar-based attention,
resulting in a dense 360-degree segmentation mask. With extensive experiments
on both, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes-LidarSeg, we quantitatively demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model, outperforming the state of the art by 19.0% on
SemanticKITTI and reaching 32.7% in mIoU on nuScenes-LidarSeg, where MASS is
the first work addressing the dense segmentation task. Furthermore, our
multi-attention model is shown to be very effective for 3D object detection
validated on the KITTI-3D dataset, showcasing its high generalizability to
other tasks related to 3D vision.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have
been applied to various sequence learning tasks with great success. Following
this, these models are increasingly replacing classic approaches in object
tracking applications for motion prediction. On the one hand, these models can
capture complex object dynamics with less modeling required, but on the other
hand, they depend on a large amount of training data for parameter tuning.
Towards this end, we present an approach for generating synthetic trajectory
data of unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) in image space. Since UAVs, or rather
quadrotors are dynamical systems, they can not follow arbitrary trajectories.
With the prerequisite that UAV trajectories fulfill a smoothness criterion
corresponding to a minimal change of higher-order motion, methods for planning
aggressive quadrotors flights can be utilized to generate optimal trajectories
through a sequence of 3D waypoints. By projecting these maneuver trajectories,
which are suitable for controlling quadrotors, to image space, a versatile
trajectory data set is realized. To demonstrate the applicability of the
synthetic trajectory data, we show that an RNN-based prediction model solely
trained on the generated data can outperform classic reference models on a
real-world UAV tracking dataset. The evaluation is done on the publicly
available ANTI-UAV dataset.</span>

                                        <span>The online recruitment matching system has been the core technology and
service platform in CareerBuilder. One of the major challenges in an online
recruitment scenario is to provide good matches between job posts and
candidates using a recommender system on the scale. In this paper, we discussed
the techniques for applying an embedding-based recommender system for the large
scale of job to candidates matching. To learn the comprehensive and effective
embedding for job posts and candidates, we have constructed a fused-embedding
via different levels of representation learning from raw text, semantic
entities and location information. The clusters of fused-embedding of job and
candidates are then used to build and train the Faiss index that supports
runtime approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate retrieval. After the
first stage of candidate retrieval, a second stage reranking model that
utilizes other contextual information was used to generate the final matching
result. Both offline and online evaluation results indicate a significant
improvement of our proposed two-staged embedding-based system in terms of
click-through rate (CTR), quality and normalized discounted accumulated gain
(nDCG), compared to those obtained from our baseline system. We further
described the deployment of the system that supports the million-scale job and
candidate matching process at CareerBuilder. The overall improvement of our job
to candidate matching system has demonstrated its feasibility and scalability
at a major online recruitment site.</span>

                                        <span>Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely used to characterize
entities of various types and their complex relations. Recent attempts either
rely on explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness
or graph neighborhood to learn heterogeneous network representations before
predictions. These weakly coupled manners overlook the rich interactions among
neighbor nodes, which introduces an early summarization issue. In this paper,
we propose GraphHINGE (Heterogeneous INteract and aggreGatE), which captures
and aggregates the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through
their structured neighborhoods. Specifically, we first introduce
Neighborhood-based Interaction (NI) module to model the interactive patterns
under the same metapaths, and then extend it to Cross Neighborhood-based
Interaction (CNI) module to deal with different metapaths. Next, in order to
address the complexity issue on large-scale networks, we formulate the
interaction modules via a convolutional framework and learn the parameters
efficiently with fast Fourier transform. Furthermore, we design a novel
neighborhood-based selection (NS) mechanism, a sampling strategy, to filter
high-order neighborhood information based on their low-order performance. The
extensive experiments on six different types of heterogeneous graphs
demonstrate the performance gains by comparing with state-of-the-arts in both
click-through rate prediction and top-N recommendation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Pseudo-relevance feedback mechanisms, from Rocchio to the relevance models,
have shown the usefulness of expanding and reweighting the users&#x27; initial
queries using information occurring in an initial set of retrieved documents,
known as the pseudo-relevant set. Recently, dense retrieval -- through the use
of neural contextual language models such as BERT for analysing the documents&#x27;
and queries&#x27; contents and computing their relevance scores -- has shown a
promising performance on several information retrieval tasks still relying on
the traditional inverted index for identifying documents relevant to a query.
Two different dense retrieval families have emerged: the use of single embedded
representations for each passage and query (e.g. using BERT&#x27;s [CLS] token), or
via multiple representations (e.g. using an embedding for each token of the
query and document). In this work, we conduct the first study into the
potential for multiple representation dense retrieval to be enhanced using
pseudo-relevance feedback. In particular, based on the pseudo-relevant set of
documents identified using a first-pass dense retrieval, we extract
representative feedback embeddings (using KMeans clustering) -- while ensuring
that these embeddings discriminate among passages (based on IDF) -- which are
then added to the query representation. These additional feedback embeddings
are shown to both enhance the effectiveness of a reranking as well as an
additional dense retrieval operation. Indeed, experiments on the MSMARCO
passage ranking dataset show that MAP can be improved by upto 26% on the TREC

                                        <span>Sentiment quantification is the task of estimating the relative frequency (or
&quot;prevalence&quot;) of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral,
Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts; this is especially important when
these texts are tweets, since most sentiment classification endeavours carried
out on Twitter data actually have quantification (and not the classification of
individual tweets) as their ultimate goal. It is well-known that solving
quantification via &quot;classify and count&quot; (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled
items via a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned
to a given class) is suboptimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate
quantification methods exist. In 2016, Gao and Sebastiani carried out a
systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment
quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimental protocol
followed in that work is flawed, and that its results are thus unreliable. We
now re-evaluate those quantification methods on the very same datasets, this
time following a now consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol,
that involves 5775 as many experiments as run in the original study. Our
experimentation yields results dramatically different from those obtained by
Gao and Sebastiani, and thus provide a different, much more solid understanding
of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.</span>

digitalization increases the interaction of people, software and services on
the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it. The
field is broad and has a lot of unexplored ground under numerous disciplines
such as management, psychology, and data science. Its large disciplinary

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based techniques have been widely applied to the program
analysis tasks, in fields such as type inference, fault localization, and code
summarization. Hitherto deep learning-based software engineering systems rely
thoroughly on supervised learning approaches, which require laborious manual
effort to collect and label a prohibitively large amount of data. However, most
Turing-complete imperative languages share similar control- and data-flow
structures, which make it possible to transfer knowledge learned from one
language to another. In this paper, we propose cross-lingual adaptation of
program analysis, which allows us to leverage prior knowledge learned from the
labeled dataset of one language and transfer it to the others. Specifically, we
implemented a cross-lingual adaptation framework, PLATO, to transfer a deep
learning-based type inference procedure across weakly typed languages, e.g.,
Python to JavaScript and vice versa. PLATO incorporates a novel joint graph
kernelized attention based on abstract syntax tree and control flow graph, and
applies anchor word augmentation across different languages. Besides, by
leveraging data from strongly typed languages, PLATO improves the perplexity of
the backbone cross-programming-language model and the performance of downstream
cross-lingual transfer for type inference. Experimental results illustrate that
our framework significantly improves the transferability over the baseline
method by a large margin.</span>

(e.g.\ vision, language), whilst also capturing a shared representation across
such modalities. Prior work has typically combined information from the
modalities by reconciling idiosyncratic representations directly in the
recognition model through explicit products, mixtures, or other such
factorisations. Here we introduce a novel alternative, the MEME, that avoids
such explicit combinations by repurposing semi-supervised VAEs to combine
information between modalities implicitly through mutual supervision. This
formulation naturally allows learning from partially-observed data where some
modalities can be entirely missing -- something that most existing approaches
either cannot handle, or do so to a limited extent. We demonstrate that MEME
outperforms baselines on standard metrics across both partial and complete
observation schemes on the MNIST-SVHN (image-image) and CUB (image-text)
datasets. We also contrast the quality of the representations learnt by mutual
supervision against standard approaches and observe interesting trends in its
ability to capture relatedness between data.</span>

although there are some correlation analysis of features based on covariance,
there is no relevant research on exploring structural feature correlation on
graphs with graph neural network based models. In this paper, we introduce
graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional
space to explore some preliminary results on structural feature correlation,
which is based on graph neural network. The results show that there exists high
correlation between some of the structural features. A redundant feature
combination with initial node features, which is filtered by graph neural
network has improved its classification accuracy in some graph datasets. We
compare the difference between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings
between features and show that the simplest is the best. We generalize on the
synthetic geometric graphs and certify the results on prediction difficulty

                                        <span>We consider a class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) problem. While
some recently proposed algorithms utilized variants of knowledge distillation
(KD) technique to tackle the problem, they only partially addressed the key
additional challenges in CISS that causes the catastrophic forgetting; i.e.,
the semantic drift of the background class and multi-label prediction issue. To
better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M
(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining
several techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we
make three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background
class to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone
network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling
to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny
exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and
stability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better
performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough and
extensive ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem
compared to the standard class-incremental learning for classification.</span>

                                        <span>Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental research task in digital text
forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the
same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that
focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first
category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features,
where one has full control over which features are considered and what they
actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV
methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control
mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a
potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear
the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions,
which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To
tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise,
which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV
methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the
writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into
the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better
results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases,
with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%.</span>

explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image,
while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to
high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of
latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the
refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of
compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic
transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows
flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of
the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model&#x27;s strength and
robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from
simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor
scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality
and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further
qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model&#x27;s

                                        <span>Through solving pretext tasks, self-supervised learning (SSL) leverages
unlabeled data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional
input features in the downstream task. A common pretext task consists in
pretraining a SSL model on pseudo-labels derived from the original signal. This
technique is particularly relevant for speech data where various meaningful
signal processing features may serve as pseudo-labels. However, the process of
selecting pseudo-labels, for speech or other types of data, remains mostly
unexplored and currently relies on observing the results on the final
downstream task. Nevertheless, this methodology is not sustainable at scale due
to substantial computational (hence carbon) costs. Thus, this paper introduces
a practical and theoretical framework to select relevant pseudo-labels with
respect to a given downstream task. More precisely, we propose a functional
estimator of the pseudo-label utility grounded in the conditional independence
theory, which does not require any training. The experiments conducted on
speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition validate our estimator,
showing a significant correlation between the performance observed on the
downstream task and the utility estimates obtained with our approach,
facilitating the prospection of relevant pseudo-labels for self-supervised
speech representation learning.</span>

their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from
high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their
exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of
modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex
cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to
deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack
of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their
general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted
features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding
the vector space before the NNs&#x27; output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten
the deep feature vectors&#x27; properties under classification tasks. Main attention
is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse
effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived
from our model&#x27;s formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition

functions -- scoring functions that judge solution optimality. Choosing
informative fitness functions is crucial to meeting the goals of a tester.
Unfortunately, many goals - such as forcing the class-under-test to throw
exceptions, increasing test suite diversity, and attaining Strong Mutation
Coverage - do not have effective fitness function formulations. We propose that
meeting such goals requires treating fitness function identification as a
secondary optimization step. An adaptive algorithm that can vary the selection
of fitness functions could adjust its selection throughout the generation
process to maximize goal attainment, based on the current population of test
suites. To test this hypothesis, we have implemented two reinforcement learning
algorithms in the EvoSuite unit test generation framework, and used these
algorithms to dynamically set the fitness functions used during generation for
the three goals identified above.

We have evaluated our framework, EvoSuiteFIT, on a set of Java case examples.
EvoSuiteFIT techniques attain significant improvements for two of the three
goals, and show limited improvements on the third when the number of
generations of evolution is fixed. Additionally, for two of the three goals,
EvoSuiteFIT detects faults missed by the other techniques. The ability to
adjust fitness functions allows strategic choices that efficiently produce more
effective test suites, and examining these choices offers insight into how to
attain our testing goals. We find that adaptive fitness function selection is a
powerful technique to apply when an effective fitness function does not already
exist for achieving a testing goal.</span>

important problem in fashion e-commerce: color variants identification, i.e.,
identifying fashion products that match exactly in their design (or style), but
only to differ in their color. At first we attempt to tackle the problem by
obtaining manual annotations (depicting whether two products are color
variants), and train a supervised triplet loss based neural network model to
learn representations of fashion products. However, for large scale real-world
industrial datasets such as addressed in our paper, it is infeasible to obtain
annotations for the entire dataset, while capturing all the difficult corner
cases. Interestingly, we observed that color variants are essentially
manifestations of color jitter based augmentations. Thus, we instead explore
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to solve this problem. We observed that existing

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range
of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as &quot;black-box&quot; and lack of
interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an
intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most
existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while
neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we
focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by
cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable
CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to
only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse
Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few)
class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter&#x27;s activation to pass only
when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and
highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger
interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our
model displays benefits in applications like object localization and
adversarial sample detection. Code link: https://github.com/hyliang96/CSGCNN.</span>

optimizing the physical layer of wireless communications by defining different
class of problems and the possible solutions to handle them. In Section 9.2, we
present all the basic theory needed to address a RL problem, i.e. Markov
decision process (MDP), Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP),
but also two very important and widely used algorithms for RL, i.e. the
Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. We also introduce the deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) paradigm and the section ends with an introduction to the
multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework. Section 9.3 focuses on some toy examples
to illustrate how the basic concepts of RL are employed in communication
systems. We present applications extracted from literature with simplified
system models using similar notation as in Section 9.2 of this Chapter. In
Section 9.3, we also focus on modeling RL problems, i.e. how action and state
spaces and rewards are chosen. The Chapter is concluded in Section 9.4 with a
prospective thought on RL trends and it ends with a review of a broader state
of the art in Section 9.5.</span>

finite sample. We prove that the metric space defined by the sample endowed
with a computable metric known as sample Fermat distance converges a.s. in the
sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. The limiting object is the manifold itself endowed
with the population Fermat distance, an intrinsic metric that accounts for both
the geometry of the manifold and the density that produces the sample. This
result is applied to obtain intrinsic persistence diagrams, which are less
sensitive to the particular embedding of the manifold in the Euclidean space.
We show that this approach is robust to outliers and deduce a method for
pattern recognition in signals, with applications in real data.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the close connection between exploration and sample efficiency, most
state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms include no considerations
for exploration beyond maximizing the entropy of the policy. In this work we
address this seeming missed opportunity. We observe that the most common
formulation of directed exploration in deep RL, known as bonus-based
exploration (BBE), suffers from bias and slow coverage in the few-sample
regime. This causes BBE to be actively detrimental to policy learning in many
control tasks. We show that by decoupling the task policy from the exploration
policy, directed exploration can be highly effective for sample-efficient
continuous control. Our method, Decoupled Exploration and Exploitation Policies
(DEEP), can be combined with any off-policy RL algorithm without modification.
When used in conjunction with soft actor-critic, DEEP incurs no performance
penalty in densely-rewarding environments. On sparse environments, DEEP gives a
several-fold improvement in data efficiency due to better exploration.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, it is growing interest to make Machine Learning (ML) systems more
understandable and trusting to general users. Thus, generating explanations for
ML system behaviours that are understandable to human beings is a central
scientific and technological issue addressed by the rapidly growing research
area of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recently, it is becoming
more and more evident that new directions to create better explanations should
take into account what a good explanation is to a human user, and consequently,
develop XAI solutions able to provide user-centred explanations. This paper
suggests taking advantage of developing an XAI general approach that allows
producing explanations for an ML system behaviour in terms of different and
user-selected input features, i.e., explanations composed of input properties
that the human user can select according to his background knowledge and goals.
To this end, we propose an XAI general approach which is able: 1) to construct
explanations in terms of input features that represent more salient and
understandable input properties for a user, which we call here Middle-Level
input Features (MLFs), 2) to be applied to different types of MLFs. We
experimentally tested our approach on two different datasets and using three
different types of MLFs. The results seem encouraging.</span>

several domains, relying on minimal architectural priors from the designer. In
Human Action Recognition (HAR), attention mechanisms have been primarily
adopted on top of standard convolutional or recurrent layers, improving the
overall generalization capability. In this work, we introduce Action
Transformer (AcT), a simple, fully self-attentional architecture that
consistently outperforms more elaborated networks that mix convolutional,
recurrent, and attentive layers. In order to limit computational and energy
requests, building on previous human action recognition research, the proposed
approach exploits 2D pose representations over small temporal windows,
providing a low latency solution for accurate and effective real-time
performance. Moreover, we open-source MPOSE2021, a new large-scale dataset, as
an attempt to build a formal training and evaluation benchmark for real-time
short-time human action recognition. Extensive experimentation on MPOSE2021
with our proposed methodology and several previous architectural solutions
proves the effectiveness of the AcT model and poses the base for future work on
HAR.</span>

                                        <span>Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) allows to analyze binary data by deriving
concepts and ordering them in lattices. One of the main goals of FCA is to
enable humans to comprehend the information that is encapsulated in the data;
however, the large size of concept lattices is a limiting factor for the
feasibility of understanding the underlying structural properties. The size of
such a lattice depends on the number of subcontexts in the corresponding formal
context that are isomorphic to a contranominal scale of high dimension. In this
work, we propose the algorithm ContraFinder that enables the computation of all
contranominal scales of a given formal context. Leveraging this algorithm, we
introduce delta-adjusting, a novel approach in order to decrease the number of
contranominal scales in a formal context by the selection of an appropriate
attribute subset. We demonstrate that delta-adjusting a context reduces the
size of the hereby emerging sub-semilattice and that the implication set is
restricted to meaningful implications. This is evaluated with respect to its
associated knowledge by means of a classification task. Hence, our proposed
technique strongly improves understandability while preserving important
conceptual structures.</span>

vehicle coordination can be modeled as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) tasks. QMIX, a widely popular MARL algorithm, has been used as a
baseline for the benchmark environments, e.g., Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC), Difficulty-Enhanced Predator-Prey (DEPP). Recent variants of QMIX
target relaxing the monotonicity constraint of QMIX, allowing for performance
improvement in SMAC. In this paper, we investigate the code-level optimizations
of these variants and the monotonicity constraint. (1) We find that such
improvements of the variants are significantly affected by various code-level
optimizations. (2) The experiment results show that QMIX with normalized
optimizations outperforms other works in SMAC; (3) beyond the common wisdom
from these works, the monotonicity constraint can improve sample efficiency in
SMAC and DEPP. We also discuss why monotonicity constraints work well in purely
cooperative tasks with a theoretical analysis. We open-source the code at

Cram\&#x27;er-Rao (CR) type inequalities. In particular, we focus on Eguchi&#x27;s theory
of obtaining dualistic geometric structures from a divergence function and then
applying Amari-Nagoaka&#x27;s theory to obtain a CR type inequality. The classical
deterministic CR inequality is derived from Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence.
We show that this framework could be generalized to other CR type inequalities
through four examples: $\alpha$-version of CR inequality, generalized CR
inequality, Bayesian CR inequality, and Bayesian $\alpha$-CR inequality. These
are obtained from, respectively, $I_\alpha$-divergence (or relative
$\alpha$-entropy), generalized Csisz\&#x27;ar divergence, Bayesian KL divergence,

                                        <span>We study the problem of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse
linear contextual bandits, where a decision maker can only adapt decisions at a
batch level. In particular, the decision maker, only observing rewards at the
end of each batch, dynamically decides how many individuals to include in the
next batch (at the current batch&#x27;s end) and what personalized action-selection
scheme to adopt within the batch. Such batch constraints are ubiquitous in a
variety of practical contexts, including personalized product offerings in
marketing and medical treatment selection in clinical trials. We characterize
the fundamental learning limit in this problem via a novel lower bound analysis
and provide a simple, exploration-free algorithm that uses the LASSO estimator,
which achieves the minimax optimal performance characterized by the lower bound
(up to log factors). To our best knowledge, our work provides the first inroad
into a rigorous understanding of dynamic batch learning with high-dimensional
covariates. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on both synthetic
data and the Warfarin medical dosing data. The empirical results show that with
three batches (hence only two opportunities to adapt), our algorithm already
performs comparably (in terms of statistical performance) to the
state-of-the-art fully online high-dimensional linear contextual bandits
algorithm. As an added bonus, since our algorithm operates in batches, it is
orders of magnitudes faster than fully online learning algorithms. As such, our
algorithm provides a desirable candidate for practical data-driven personalized
decision making problems, where limited adaptivity is often a hard constraint.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a standard distributed optimisation setting where $N$ machines,
each holding a $d$-dimensional function $f_i$, aim to jointly minimise the sum
of the functions $\sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^N f_i (x)$. This problem arises naturally in
large-scale distributed optimisation, where a standard solution is to apply
variants of (stochastic) gradient descent. We focus on the communication
complexity of this problem: our main result provides the first fully
unconditional bounds on total number of bits which need to be sent and received
by the $N$ machines to solve this problem under point-to-point communication,
within a given error-tolerance. Specifically, we show that $\Omega( Nd \log d /
N\varepsilon)$ total bits need to be communicated between the machines to find
an additive $\epsilon$-approximation to the minimum of $\sum_{i &#x3D; 1}^N f_i
(x)$. The result holds for both deterministic and randomised algorithms, and,
importantly, requires no assumptions on the algorithm structure. The lower
bound is tight under certain restrictions on parameter values, and is matched
within constant factors for quadratic objectives by a new variant of quantised
gradient descent, which we describe and analyse. Our results bring over tools
from communication complexity to distributed optimisation, which has potential
for further applications.</span>

                                        <span>Despite impressive results, deep learning-based technologies also raise
severe privacy and environmental concerns induced by the training procedure
often conducted in datacenters. In response, alternatives to centralized
training such as Federated Learning (FL) have emerged. Perhaps unexpectedly,
FL, in particular, is starting to be deployed at a global scale by companies
that must adhere to new legal demands and policies originating from governments
and civil society for privacy protection. However, the potential environmental
impact related to FL remains unclear and unexplored. This paper offers the
first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of FL. First, we propose a
rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the
investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. Then,
we compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our
findings show that FL, despite being slower to converge in some cases, may
result in a comparatively greener impact than a centralized equivalent setup.
We performed extensive experiments across different types of datasets,
settings, and various deep learning models with FL. Finally, we highlight and
connect the reported results to the future challenges and trends in FL to
reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware
capabilities, and stronger industry transparency.</span>

used for disaster response and crisis management if processed accurately and
quickly. However, the data present in such situations is ever-changing, and
using considerable resources during such a crisis is not feasible. Therefore,
we have to develop a low resource and continually learning system that
incorporates text classification models which are robust against noisy and

graphs. Besides of existed neighbor sampling techniques, scalable methods
decoupling graph convolutions and other learnable transformations into
preprocessing and post classifier allow normal minibatch training. By replacing
redundant concatenation operation with attention mechanism in SIGN, we propose
Scalable and Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (SAGN). SAGN can adaptively gather
neighborhood information among different hops. To further improve scalable
models on semi-supervised learning tasks, we propose Self-Label-Enhance (SLE)
framework combining self-training approach and label propagation in depth. We
add base model with a scalable node label module. Then we iteratively train
models and enhance train set in several stages. To generate input of node label
module, we directly apply label propagation based on one-hot encoded label
vectors without inner random masking. We find out that empirically the label
leakage has been effectively alleviated after graph convolutions. The hard
pseudo labels in enhanced train set participate in label propagation with true
labels. Experiments on both inductive and transductive datasets demonstrate
that, compared with other sampling-based and sampling-free methods, SAGN
achieves better or comparable results and SLE can further improve performance.</span>

                                        <span>Physics-informed neural networks exploit the existing models of the
underlying physical systems to generate higher accuracy results with fewer
data. Such approaches can help drastically reduce the computation time and
generate a good estimate of computationally intensive processes in power
systems, such as dynamic security assessment or optimal power flow. Combined
with the extraction of worst-case guarantees for the neural network
performance, such neural networks can be applied in safety-critical
applications in power systems and build a high level of trust among power
system operators. This paper takes the first step and applies, for the first
time to our knowledge, Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Worst-Case
Guarantees for the DC Optimal Power Flow problem. We look for guarantees
related to (i) maximum constraint violations, (ii) maximum distance between
predicted and optimal decision variables, and (iii) maximum sub-optimality in
the entire input domain. In a range of PGLib-OPF networks, we demonstrate how
physics-informed neural networks can be supplied with worst-case guarantees and
how they can lead to reduced worst-case violations compared with conventional
neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>A novel method for feature fusion in convolutional neural networks is
proposed in this paper. Different feature fusion techniques are suggested to
facilitate the flow of information and improve the training of deep neural
networks. Some of these techniques as well as the proposed network can be
considered a type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Network, where a layer can
receive inputs from other layers and have outputs to other layers. In the
proposed general framework of Lattice Fusion Network (LFNet), feature maps of
each convolutional layer are passed to other layers based on a lattice graph
structure, where nodes are convolutional layers. To evaluate the performance of
the proposed architecture, different designs based on the general framework of
LFNet are implemented for the task of image denoising. This task is used as an
example where training deep convolutional networks is needed. Results are
compared with state of the art methods. The proposed network is able to achieve
better results with far fewer learnable parameters, which shows the
effectiveness of LFNets for training of deep neural networks.</span>

learning on graphs, but its training is notoriously difficult to scale both in
terms of graph size and the number of model parameters. Although some work has
explored training on large-scale graphs (e.g., GraphSAGE, ClusterGCN, etc.), we
pioneer efficient training of large-scale GCN models (i.e., ultra-wide,
overparameterized models) with the proposal of a novel, distributed training
framework. Our proposed training methodology, called GIST, disjointly
partitions the parameters of a GCN model into several, smaller sub-GCNs that
are trained independently and in parallel. In addition to being compatible with
any GCN architecture, GIST improves model performance, scales to training on
arbitrarily large graphs, significantly decreases wall-clock training time, and
enables the training of markedly overparameterized GCN models. Remarkably, with
GIST, we train an astonishgly-wide 32,768-dimensional GraphSAGE model, which
exceeds the capacity of a single GPU by a factor of 8X, to SOTA performance on
the Amazon2M dataset.</span>

                                        <span>We present CSWin Transformer, an efficient and effective Transformer-based
backbone for general-purpose vision tasks. A challenging issue in Transformer
design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local
self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address
this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for
computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel
that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the
input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a detailed mathematical
analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for
different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling
capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce
Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional
information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports
arbitrary input resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for
downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure,
CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks.
Specifically, it achieves 85.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra
training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection
task, and 51.7 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing
previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and
+2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting. By further pretraining on
the larger dataset ImageNet-21K, we achieve 87.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K
and state-of-the-art segmentation performance on ADE20K with 55.2 mIoU. The

                                        <span>Clinical decision-making in oncology involves multimodal data such as
radiology scans, molecular profiling, histopathology slides, and clinical
factors. Despite the importance of these modalities individually, no deep
learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis.
Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse
multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to
combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities
(such as H&amp;E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a
comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality
are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the
information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal
orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by
incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS
in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly
outperforming (p&#x3D;0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median
C-index of 0.718 +/- 0.064. The prognostic model significantly stratifies
glioma patients by OS within clinical subsets, adding further granularity to
prognostic clinical grading and molecular subtyping.</span>

discrimination against social categories such as race or gender that could
occur or be amplified as a result of algorithmic decisions. Simultaneously,
real-world disparities continue to exist, even before algorithmic decisions are
made. In this work, we draw on insights from the social sciences and humanistic
studies brought into the realm of causal modeling and constrained optimization,
and develop a novel algorithmic framework for tackling pre-existing real-world
disparities. The purpose of our framework, which we call the &quot;impact
remediation framework,&quot; is to measure real-world disparities and discover the
optimal intervention policies that could help improve equity or access to
opportunity for those who are underserved with respect to an outcome of
interest. We develop a disaggregated approach to tackling pre-existing
disparities that relaxes the typical set of assumptions required for the use of
social categories in structural causal models. Our approach flexibly
incorporates counterfactuals and is compatible with various ontological
assumptions about the nature of social categories. We demonstrate impact
remediation with a real-world case study and compare our disaggregated approach
to an existing state-of-the-art approach, comparing its structure and resulting
policy recommendations. In contrast to most work on optimal policy learning, we
explore disparity reduction itself as an objective, explicitly focusing the
power of algorithms on reducing inequality.</span>

                                        <span>Modern day engineering problems are ubiquitously characterized by
sophisticated computer codes that map parameters or inputs to an underlying
physical process. In other situations, experimental setups are used to model
the physical process in a laboratory, ensuring high precision while being
costly in materials and logistics. In both scenarios, only limited amount of
data can be generated by querying the expensive information source at a finite
number of inputs or designs. This problem is compounded further in the presence
of a high-dimensional input space. State-of-the-art parameter space dimension
reduction methods, such as active subspace, aim to identify a subspace of the
original input space that is sufficient to explain the output response. These
methods are restricted by their reliance on gradient evaluations or copious
data, making them inadequate to expensive problems without direct access to
gradients. The proposed methodology is gradient-free and fully Bayesian, as it
quantifies uncertainty in both the low-dimensional subspace and the surrogate
model parameters. This enables a full quantification of epistemic uncertainty
and robustness to limited data availability. It is validated on multiple
datasets from engineering and science and compared to two other
state-of-the-art methods based on four aspects: a) recovery of the active
subspace, b) deterministic prediction accuracy, c) probabilistic prediction
accuracy, and d) training time. The comparison shows that the proposed method
improves the active subspace recovery and predictive accuracy, in both the
deterministic and probabilistic sense, when only few model observations are
available for training, at the cost of increased training time.</span>

train dynamic and measurement models by learning from observed data. However,
most existing differentiable particle filters are within the bootstrap particle
filtering framework and fail to incorporate the information from latest
observations to construct better proposals. In this paper, we utilize
conditional normalizing flows to construct proposal distributions for
differentiable particle filters, enriching the distribution families that the
proposal distributions can represent. In addition, normalizing flows are
incorporated in the construction of the dynamic model, resulting in a more
expressive dynamic model. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
conditional normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters in a visual

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose approximate Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms to solve
convex optimization problems over graph-structured support sets where the
\textit{linear minimization oracle} (LMO) cannot be efficiently obtained in
general. We first demonstrate that two popular approximation assumptions
(\textit{additive} and \textit{multiplicative gap errors)}, are not valid for
our problem, in that no cheap gap-approximate LMO oracle exists in general.
Instead, a new \textit{approximate dual maximization oracle} (DMO) is proposed,
which approximates the inner product rather than the gap. When the objective is
$L$-smooth, we prove that the standard FW method using a $\delta$-approximate
DMO converges as $\mathcal{O}(L / \delta t + (1-\delta)(\delta^{-1} +
\delta^{-2}))$ in general, and as $\mathcal{O}(L/(\delta^2(t+2)))$ over a
$\delta$-relaxation of the constraint set. Additionally, when the objective is
$\mu$-strongly convex and the solution is unique, a variant of FW converges to
$\mathcal{O}(L^2\log(t)/(\mu \delta^6 t^2))$ with the same per-iteration
complexity. Our empirical results suggest that even these improved bounds are
pessimistic, with significant improvement in recovering real-world images with
graph-structured sparsity.</span>

                                        <span>Neural network training and validation rely on the availability of large
high-quality datasets. However, in many cases only incomplete datasets are
available, particularly in health care applications, where each patient
typically undergoes different clinical procedures or can drop out of a study.
Since the data to train the neural networks need to be complete, most studies
discard the incomplete datapoints, which reduces the size of the training data,
or impute the missing features, which can lead to artefacts. Alas, both
approaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we
introduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use
highly incomplete datasets. First, the dataset is split into subsets of samples
containing all values for a certain cluster of features. Then, these subsets
are used to train individual neural networks. Finally, this ensemble of neural
networks is combined into a single neural network whose training is fine-tuned
using all complete datapoints. Using two highly incomplete real-world medical
datasets, we show that GapNet improves the identification of patients with
underlying Alzheimer&#x27;s disease pathology and of patients at risk of
hospitalization due to Covid-19. By distilling the information available in
incomplete datasets without having to reduce their size or to impute missing
values, GapNet will permit to extract valuable information from a wide range of
datasets, benefiting diverse fields from medicine to engineering.</span>

                                        <span>The idea behind object-centric representation learning is that natural scenes
can better be modeled as compositions of objects and their relations as opposed
to distributed representations. This inductive bias can be injected into neural
networks to potentially improve systematic generalization and learning
efficiency of downstream tasks in scenes with multiple objects. In this paper,
we train state-of-the-art unsupervised models on five common multi-object
datasets and evaluate segmentation accuracy and downstream object property
prediction. In addition, we study systematic generalization and robustness by
investigating the settings where either single objects are out-of-distribution
-- e.g., having unseen colors, textures, and shapes -- or global properties of
the scene are altered -- e.g., by occlusions, cropping, or increasing the
number of objects. From our experimental study, we find object-centric
representations to be generally useful for downstream tasks and robust to
shifts in the data distribution, especially if shifts affect single objects.</span>

non-repetitive time-varying parameters, which is also called non-repetitive
TVSs, is realized in this paper using iterative learning control (ILC). A
machine learning (ML) based nominal model update mechanism, which utilizes the
linear regression technique to update the nominal model at each ILC trial only
using the current trial information, is proposed for non-repetitive TVSs in
order to enhance the ILC performance. Given that the ML mechanism forces the
model uncertainties to remain within the ILC robust tolerance, an ILC update
law is proposed to deal with non-repetitive TVSs. How to tune parameters inside
ML and ILC algorithms to achieve the desired aggregate performance is also
provided. The robustness and reliability of the proposed method are verified by
simulations. Comparison with current state-of-the-art demonstrates its superior
control performance in terms of controlling precision. This paper broadens ILC
applications from time-invariant systems to non-repetitive TVSs, adopts ML
regression technique to estimate non-repetitive time-varying parameters between
two ILC trials and proposes a detailed parameter tuning mechanism to achieve
desired performance, which are the main contributions.</span>

                                        <span>Edge computing provides a promising paradigm to support the implementation of
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by offloading tasks to nearby edge nodes.
Meanwhile, the increasing network size makes it impractical for centralized
data processing due to limited bandwidth, and consequently a decentralized
learning scheme is preferable. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely
investigated and shown to be a promising solution for decision-making and
optimal control processes. For RL in a decentralized setup, edge nodes (agents)
connected through a communication network aim to work collaboratively to find a
policy to optimize the global reward as the sum of local rewards. However,
communication costs, scalability and adaptation in complex environments with
heterogeneous agents may significantly limit the performance of decentralized
RL. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has a structure that
allows for decentralized implementation, and has shown faster convergence than
gradient descent based methods. Therefore, we propose an adaptive stochastic
incremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm and apply the asI-ADMM to decentralized
RL with edge-computing-empowered IIoT networks. We provide convergence
properties for proposed algorithms by designing a Lyapunov function and prove
that the asI-ADMM has $O(\frac{1}{k}) +O(\frac{1}{M})$ convergence rate where
$k$ and $ M$ are the number of iterations and batch samples, respectively.
Then, we test our algorithm with two supervised learning problems. For
performance evaluation, we simulate two applications in decentralized RL
settings with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents. The experiment results show
that our proposed algorithms outperform the state of the art in terms of
communication costs and scalability, and can well adapt to complex IoT
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated a capacity for
perceptually impressive synthesis, but can they also be great likelihood-based
models? We answer this in the affirmative, and introduce a family of
diffusion-based generative models that obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on
standard image density estimation benchmarks. Unlike other diffusion-based
models, our method allows for efficient optimization of the noise schedule
jointly with the rest of the model. We show that the variational lower bound
(VLB) simplifies to a remarkably short expression in terms of the
signal-to-noise ratio of the diffused data, thereby improving our theoretical
understanding of this model class. Using this insight, we prove an equivalence
between several models proposed in the literature. In addition, we show that
the continuous-time VLB is invariant to the noise schedule, except for the
signal-to-noise ratio at its endpoints. This enables us to learn a noise
schedule that minimizes the variance of the resulting VLB estimator, leading to
faster optimization. Combining these advances with architectural improvements,
we obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on image density estimation benchmarks,
outperforming autoregressive models that have dominated these benchmarks for
many years, with often significantly faster optimization. In addition, we show
how to turn the model into a bits-back compression scheme, and demonstrate
lossless compression rates close to the theoretical optimum.</span>

                                        <span>Processing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly
task, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Therefore, Ai has
become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a
supportive tool for doctors. AI tools highly depend on data for training the
models. However, there are several constraints to access to large amounts of
medical data to train machine learning algorithms in the medical domain, e.g.,
due to privacy concerns and the costly, time-consuming medical data annotation
process. To address this, in this paper we present a novel synthetic data
generation pipeline called SinGAN-Seg to produce synthetic medical data with
the corresponding annotated ground truth masks. We show that these synthetic
data generation pipelines can be used as an alternative to bypass privacy
concerns and as an alternative way to produce artificial segmentation datasets
with corresponding ground truth masks to avoid the tedious medical data
annotation process. As a proof of concept, we used an open polyp segmentation
dataset. By training UNet++ using both the real polyp segmentation dataset and
the corresponding synthetic dataset generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we
show that the synthetic data can achieve a very close performance to the real
data when the real segmentation datasets are large enough. In addition, we show
that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improving the
performance of segmentation algorithms when the training dataset is very small.
Since our SinGAN-Seg pipeline is applicable for any medical dataset, this
pipeline can be used with any other segmentation datasets.</span>

analysis of the Stochastic ExtraGradient (SEG) method with constant step size,
and presenting variations of the method that yield favorable convergence. We
first note that the last iterate of the basic SEG method only contracts to a
fixed neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium, independent of the step size. This
contrasts sharply with the standard setting of minimization where standard
stochastic algorithms converge to a neighborhood that vanishes in proportion to
the square-root (constant) step size. Under the same setting, however, we prove
that when augmented with iteration averaging, SEG provably converges to the
Nash equilibrium, and such a rate is provably accelerated by incorporating a
scheduled restarting procedure. In the interpolation setting, we achieve an
optimal convergence rate up to tight constants. We present numerical
experiments that validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the SEG method when equipped with iteration averaging and
restarting.</span>

                                        <span>Cooperative problems under continuous control have always been the focus of
multi-agent reinforcement learning. Existing algorithms suffer from the problem
of uneven learning degree with the increase of the number of agents. In this
paper, a new structure for a multi-agent actor critic is proposed, and the
self-attention mechanism is applied in the critic network and the value
decomposition method used to solve the uneven problem. The proposed algorithm
makes full use of the samples in the replay memory buffer to learn the behavior
of a class of agents. First, a new update method is proposed for policy
networks that promotes learning efficiency. Second, the utilization of samples
is improved, at the same time reflecting the ability of perspective-taking
among groups. Finally, the &quot;deceptive signal&quot; in training is eliminated and the
learning degree among agents is more uniform than in the existing methods.
Multiple experiments were conducted in two typical scenarios of a multi-agent
particle environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can
perform better than the state-of-the-art ones, and that it exhibits higher
learning efficiency with an increasing number of agents.</span>

2021 on Swiss German Speech to Standard German Text, a public competition on
dialect recognition and translation. Swiss German refers to the multitude of
Alemannic dialects spoken in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. Swiss
German differs significantly from standard German in pronunciation, word
inventory and grammar. It is mostly incomprehensible to native German speakers.
Moreover, it lacks a standardized written script. To solve the challenging
task, we propose a hybrid automatic speech recognition system with a lexicon
that incorporates translations, a 1st pass language model that deals with Swiss
German particularities, a transfer-learned acoustic model and a strong neural
language model for 2nd pass rescoring. Our submission reaches 46.04% BLEU on a

unify diverse architectures such as Euclidean convolutional neural networks,
graph neural networks, and group neural networks under the umbrella of
algebraic signal processing. An AlgNN is a stacked layered information
processing structure where each layer is conformed by an algebra, a vector
space and a homomorphism between the algebra and the space of endomorphisms of
the vector space. Signals are modeled as elements of the vector space and are
processed by convolutional filters that are defined as the images of the
elements of the algebra under the action of the homomorphism. We analyze
stability of algebraic filters and AlgNNs to deformations of the homomorphism
and derive conditions on filters that lead to Lipschitz stable operators. We
conclude that stable algebraic filters have frequency responses -- defined as
eigenvalue domain representations -- whose derivative is inversely proportional
to the frequency -- defined as eigenvalue magnitudes. It follows that for a
given level of discriminability, AlgNNs are more stable than algebraic filters,
thereby explaining their better empirical performance. This same phenomenon has
been proven for Euclidean convolutional neural networks and graph neural
networks. Our analysis shows that this is a deep algebraic property shared by a
number of architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Autonomous Driving (AD) related features provide new forms of mobility that
are also beneficial for other kind of intelligent and autonomous systems like
robots, smart transportation, and smart industries. For these applications, the
decisions need to be made fast and in real-time. Moreover, in the quest for
electric mobility, this task must follow low power policy, without affecting
much the autonomy of the mean of transport or the robot. These two challenges
can be tackled using the emerging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). When deployed
on a specialized neuromorphic hardware, SNNs can achieve high performance with
low latency and low power consumption. In this paper, we use an SNN connected
to an event-based camera for facing one of the key problems for AD, i.e., the
classification between cars and other objects. To consume less power than
traditional frame-based cameras, we use a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The
experiments are made following an offline supervised learning rule, followed by
mapping the learnt SNN model on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip. Our
best experiment achieves an accuracy on offline implementation of 86%, that
drops to 83% when it is ported onto the Loihi Chip. The Neuromorphic Hardware
implementation has maximum 0.72 ms of latency for every sample, and consumes
only 310 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
implementation of an event-based car classifier on a Neuromorphic Chip.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning models are often deployed in different settings than they
were trained and validated on, posing a challenge to practitioners who wish to
predict how well the deployed model will perform on a target distribution. If
an unlabeled sample from the target distribution is available, along with a
labeled sample from a possibly different source distribution, standard
approaches such as importance weighting can be applied to estimate performance
on the target. However, importance weighting struggles when the source and
target distributions have non-overlapping support or are high-dimensional.
Taking inspiration from fields such as epidemiology and polling, we develop
Mandoline, a new evaluation framework that mitigates these issues. Our key
insight is that practitioners may have prior knowledge about the ways in which
the distribution shifts, which we can use to better guide the importance
weighting procedure. Specifically, users write simple &quot;slicing functions&quot; -
noisy, potentially correlated binary functions intended to capture possible
axes of distribution shift - to compute reweighted performance estimates. We
further describe a density ratio estimation framework for the slices and show
how its estimation error scales with slice quality and dataset size. Empirical
validation on NLP and vision tasks shows that \name can estimate performance on
the target distribution up to $3\times$ more accurately compared to standard
baselines.</span>

functions, but more importantly, the particular assignment of typical
parameters to functions of different complexity. Taking the number of
activation regions as a complexity measure, recent works have shown that the
practical complexity of deep ReLU networks is often far from the theoretical
maximum. In this work we show that this phenomenon also occurs in networks with
maxout (multi-argument) activation functions and when considering the decision
boundaries in classification tasks. We also show that the parameter space has a
multitude of full-dimensional regions with widely different complexity, and
obtain nontrivial lower bounds on the expected complexity. Finally, we
investigate different parameter initialization procedures and show that they
can increase the speed of convergence in training.</span>

acyclic graph (DAG). Learning the DAG is an NP-hard problem and exact learning
algorithms are feasible only for small sets of variables. We propose two
scalable heuristics for learning DAGs in the linear structural equation case.
Our methods learn the DAG by alternating between unconstrained gradient
descent-based step to optimize an objective function and solving a maximum
acyclic subgraph problem to enforce acyclicity. Thanks to this decoupling, our
methods scale up beyond thousands of variables.</span>

property of convolutional networks, showing that small shifts in the input can
affect the output predictions substantially. In this paper, we ask whether lack
of shift invariance is a problem in sound event classification, and whether
there are benefits in addressing it. Specifically, we evaluate two pooling
methods to improve shift invariance in CNNs, based on low-pass filtering and
adaptive sampling of incoming feature maps. These methods are implemented via
small architectural modifications inserted into the pooling layers of CNNs. We
evaluate the effect of these architectural changes on the FSD50K dataset using
models of different capacity and in presence of strong regularization. We show
that these modifications consistently improve sound event classification in all
cases considered, without adding any (or adding very few) trainable parameters,
which makes them an appealing alternative to conventional pooling layers. The
outcome is a new state-of-the-art mAP of 0.541 on the FSD50K classification
benchmark.</span>

                                        <span>Training the large deep neural networks that dominate NLP requires large
datasets. Many of these are collected automatically or via crowdsourcing, and
may exhibit systematic biases or annotation artifacts. By the latter, we mean
correlations between inputs and outputs that are spurious, insofar as they do
not represent a generally held causal relationship between features and
classes; models that exploit such correlations may appear to perform a given
task well, but fail on out of sample data. In this paper we propose methods to
facilitate identification of training data artifacts, using new hybrid
approaches that combine saliency maps (which highlight important input
features) with instance attribution methods (which retrieve training samples
influential to a given prediction). We show that this proposed training-feature
attribution approach can be used to uncover artifacts in training data, and use
it to identify previously unreported artifacts in a few standard NLP datasets.
We execute a small user study to evaluate whether these methods are useful to
NLP researchers in practice, with promising results. We make code for all
methods and experiments in this paper available.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance
with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning
interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of
self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which
makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required.
In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually
simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term
spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our
architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision transformers with
three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise
multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters,
and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity
trade-offs of our models on both ImageNet and downstream tasks. Our results
demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to
transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and
robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/GFNet</span>

                                        <span>Self-attention (SA), which encodes vector sequences according to their
pairwise similarity, is widely used in speech recognition due to its strong
context modeling ability. However, when applied to long sequence data, its
accuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average
operator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which
results in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this
issue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention
(RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of
self-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the
local window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different
test data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window
length is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further
generalize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the
performance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based
speech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin
speech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate
(CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the
SA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is
only slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to
tune the window length manually.</span>

problem domain and instance as input, resulting in a knowledge acquisition
bottleneck. Meanwhile, although deep learning has achieved significant success
in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which
is incompatible with symbolic systems such as planners. We propose Latplan, an
unsupervised architecture combining deep learning and classical planning. Given
only an unlabeled set of image pairs showing a subset of transitions allowed in
the environment (training inputs), Latplan learns a complete propositional PDDL
action model of the environment. Later, when a pair of images representing the
initial and the goal states (planning inputs) is given, Latplan finds a plan to
the goal state in a symbolic latent space and returns a visualized plan
execution. We evaluate Latplan using image-based versions of 6 planning
domains: 8-puzzle, 15-Puzzle, Blocksworld, Sokoban and Two variations of

signalled via an octree. Second, we employ a deep auto-regressive generative
model to estimate the occupancy probability of each voxel given the previously
encoded ones. We then employ the estimated probabilities to code efficiently a
block using a context-based arithmetic coder. Our context has variable size and
can expand beyond the current block to learn more accurate probabilities. We
also consider using data augmentation techniques to increase the generalization
capability of the learned probability models, in particular in the presence of
noise and lower-density point clouds. Experimental evaluation, performed on a
variety of point clouds from four different datasets and with diverse
characteristics, demonstrates that our method reduces significantly (by up to
30%) the rate for lossless coding compared to the state-of-the-art MPEG codec.</span>

                                        <span>Efficient video action recognition remains a challenging problem. One large
model after another takes the place of the state-of-the-art on the Kinetics
dataset, but real-world efficiency evaluations are often lacking. In this work,
we fill this gap and investigate the use of transformers for efficient action
recognition. We propose a novel, lightweight action recognition architecture,
VideoLightFormer. In a factorized fashion, we carefully extend the 2D
convolutional Temporal Segment Network with transformers, while maintaining
spatial and temporal video structure throughout the entire model. Existing
methods often resort to one of the two extremes, where they either apply huge
transformers to video features, or minimal transformers on highly pooled video
features. Our method differs from them by keeping the transformer models small,
but leveraging full spatiotemporal feature structure. We evaluate
VideoLightFormer in a high-efficiency setting on the temporally-demanding
EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Something-Something-V2 (SSV2) datasets and find that it
achieves a better mix of efficiency and accuracy than existing state-of-the-art
models, apart from the Temporal Shift Module on SSV2.</span>

is generally challenging. Existing approaches have utilized goal relabeling on
collected experiences to alleviate issues raised from sparse rewards. However,
these methods are still limited in efficiency and cannot make full use of
experiences. In this paper, we propose Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay
(MHER), which exploits experiences more efficiently by leveraging environmental
dynamics to generate virtual achieved goals. Replacing original goals with
virtual goals generated from interaction with a trained dynamics model leads to
a novel relabeling method, \emph{model-based relabeling} (MBR). Based on MBR,
MHER performs both reinforcement learning and supervised learning for efficient
policy improvement. Theoretically, we also prove the supervised part in MHER,
i.e., goal-conditioned supervised learning with MBR data, optimizes a lower
bound on the multi-goal RL objective. Experimental results in several
point-based tasks and simulated robotics environments show that MHER achieves
significantly higher sample efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

factor super resolution, scaling with the number of trained networks. We
utilize these networks in a hierarchical super resolution algorithm that
upscales multiresolution data to a uniform high resolution without introducing

algorithm in a data reduction framework by dynamically downscaling input data
to an octree-based data structure to represent the multiresolution data before
compressing for additional storage reduction. We demonstrate that our approach

models and have been shown to improve the prediction performance, it has been
reported to be vulnerable to perturbations to the mechanism. To overcome the
vulnerability to perturbations in the mechanism, we are inspired by adversarial
training (AT), which is a powerful regularization technique for enhancing the
robustness of the models. In this paper, we propose a general training
technique for natural language processing tasks, including AT for attention
(Attention AT) and more interpretable AT for attention (Attention iAT). The
proposed techniques improved the prediction performance and the model
interpretability by exploiting the mechanisms with AT. In particular, Attention
iAT boosts those advantages by introducing adversarial perturbation, which
enhances the difference in the attention of the sentences. Evaluation
experiments with ten open datasets revealed that AT for attention mechanisms,
especially Attention iAT, demonstrated (1) the best performance in nine out of
ten tasks and (2) more interpretable attention (i.e., the resulting attention
correlated more strongly with gradient-based word importance) for all tasks.
Additionally, the proposed techniques are (3) much less dependent on
perturbation size in AT. Our code is available at

such as seeking clarifications about the question, taking advantage of clues,
abstaining in order to avoid incorrect answers, etc. This difference in task
formulation hinders the adoption of NLP systems in real-world settings. In this
work, we take a step towards bridging this gap and present a multi-stage task
that simulates a typical human-human questioner-responder interaction such as
an interview. Specifically, the system is provided with question
simplifications, knowledge statements, examples, etc. at various stages to
improve its prediction when it is not sufficiently confident. We instantiate
the proposed task in Natural Language Inference setting where a system is
evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and find that the multi-stage formulation of our task

1.91% in Stage 2, 54.88% in Stage 3, and 72.02% in Stage 4 over the standard

for biometric identification, has been widely adopted in security-critic
applications, including transaction authentication and access control. However,
previous works have shown ASV is seriously vulnerable to recently emerged
adversarial attacks, yet effective countermeasures against them are limited. In
this paper, we adopt neural vocoders to spot adversarial samples for ASV. We
use neural vocoder to re-synthesize audio and find that the difference between
the ASV scores for the original and re-synthesized audio is a good indicator to
distinguish genuine and adversarial samples. As the very beginning work in this
direction of detecting adversarial samples for ASV, there is no reliable
baseline for comparison. So we first implement Griffin-Lim for detection and
set it as our baseline. The proposed method accomplishes effective detection
performance and outperforms all the baselines in all the settings. We also show
the neural vocoder adopted in the detection framework is dataset independent.
Our codes will be made open-source for future works to do comparison.</span>

                                        <span>Distributed learning has become a hot research topic, due to its wide
application in cluster-based large-scale learning, federated learning, edge
computing and so on. Most distributed learning methods assume no error and
attack on the workers. However, many unexpected cases, such as communication
error and even malicious attack, may happen in real applications. Hence,
Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed learning with attack or
error, has recently attracted much attention. Most existing BL methods are
synchronous, which will result in slow convergence when there exist
heterogeneous workers. Furthermore, in some applications like federated
learning and edge computing, synchronization cannot even be performed most of
the time due to the online workers (clients or edge servers). Hence,
asynchronous BL (ABL) is more general and practical than synchronous BL (SBL).
To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two ABL methods. One of them
cannot resist malicious attack. The other needs to store some training
instances on the server, which has the privacy leak problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, called buffered asynchronous stochastic gradient
descent (BASGD), for BL. BASGD is an asynchronous method. Furthermore, BASGD
has no need to store any training instances on the server, and hence can
preserve privacy in ABL. BASGD is theoretically proved to have the ability of
resisting against error and malicious attack. Moreover, BASGD has a similar
theoretical convergence rate to that of vanilla asynchronous SGD (ASGD), with
an extra constant variance. Empirical results show that BASGD can significantly
outperform vanilla ASGD and other ABL baselines, when there exists error or
attack on workers.</span>

of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) to classify radio galaxies into
four classes: Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI), Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FRII),

increase of brightness. Shifts, zoom and decrease of brightness worsened the
performance of the model. The current results show that model developed in this

                                        <span>Incomplete instances with various missing attributes in many real-world
applications have brought challenges to the classification tasks. Missing
values imputation methods are often employed to replace the missing values with
substitute values. However, this process often separates the imputation and
classification, which may lead to inferior performance since label information
are often ignored during imputation. Moreover, traditional methods may rely on
improper assumptions to initialize the missing values, whereas the
unreliability of such initialization might lead to inferior performance. To
address these problems, a novel semi-supervised conditional normalizing flow
(SSCFlow) is proposed in this paper. SSCFlow explicitly utilizes the label
information to facilitate the imputation and classification simultaneously by
estimating the conditional distribution of incomplete instances with a novel
semi-supervised normalizing flow. Moreover, SSCFlow treats the initialized
missing values as corrupted initial imputation and iteratively reconstructs
their latent representations with an overcomplete denoising autoencoder to
approximate their true conditional distribution. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Generalized correlation analysis (GCA) is concerned with uncovering linear
relationships across multiple datasets. It generalizes canonical correlation
analysis that is designed for two datasets. We study sparse GCA when there are
potentially multiple generalized correlation tuples in data and the loading
matrix has a small number of nonzero rows. It includes sparse CCA and sparse
PCA of correlation matrices as special cases. We first formulate sparse GCA as
generalized eigenvalue problems at both population and sample levels via a
careful choice of normalization constraints. Based on a Lagrangian form of the
sample optimization problem, we propose a thresholded gradient descent
algorithm for estimating GCA loading vectors and matrices in high dimensions.
We derive tight estimation error bounds for estimators generated by the
algorithm with proper initialization. We also demonstrate the prowess of the
algorithm on a number of synthetic datasets.</span>

a user knows and wants to know. This paper proposes a principled framework for
interactive visual exploration of relations in data, through views most
informative given the user&#x27;s current knowledge and objectives. The user can
input pre-existing knowledge of relations in the data and also formulate
specific exploration interests, which are then taken into account in the
exploration. The idea is to steer the exploration process towards the interests
of the user, instead of showing uninteresting or already known relations. The
user&#x27;s knowledge is modelled by a distribution over data sets parametrised by
subsets of rows and columns of data, called tile constraints. We provide a
computationally efficient implementation of this concept based on constrained
randomisation. Furthermore, we describe a novel dimensionality reduction method
for finding the views most informative to the user, which at the limit of no
background knowledge and with generic objectives reduces to PCA. We show that
the method is suitable for interactive use and is robust to noise, outperforms
standard projection pursuit visualisation methods, and gives understandable and
useful results in analysis of real-world data. We provide an open-source
implementation of the framework.</span>

                                        <span>There has been huge interest in studying human brain connectomes inferred
from different imaging modalities and exploring their relationship with human
traits, such as cognition. Brain connectomes are usually represented as
networks, with nodes corresponding to different regions of interest (ROIs) and
edges to connection strengths between ROIs. Due to the high-dimensionality and
non-Euclidean nature of networks, it is challenging to depict their population
distribution and relate them to human traits. Current approaches focus on
summarizing the network using either pre-specified topological features or
principal components analysis (PCA). In this paper, building on recent advances
in deep learning, we develop a nonlinear latent factor model to characterize
the population distribution of brain graphs and infer the relationships between
brain structural connectomes and human traits. We refer to our method as Graph
AuTo-Encoding (GATE). We applied GATE to two large-scale brain imaging
datasets, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) for adults, to understand the structural brain
connectome and its relationship with cognition. Numerical results demonstrate
huge advantages of GATE over competitors in terms of prediction accuracy,
statistical inference and computing efficiency. We found that structural
connectomes have a stronger association with a wide range of human cognitive
traits than was apparent using previous approaches.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the question of sequential prediction under the log-loss in terms
of cumulative regret. Namely, given a hypothesis class of distributions,
learner sequentially predicts the (distribution of the) next letter in sequence
and its performance is compared to the baseline of the best constant predictor
from the hypothesis class. The well-specified case corresponds to an additional
assumption that the data-generating distribution belongs to the hypothesis
class as well. Here we present results in the more general misspecified case.
Due to special properties of the log-loss, the same problem arises in the
context of competitive-optimality in density estimation, and model selection.
For the $d$-dimensional Gaussian location hypothesis class, we show that
cumulative regrets in the well-specified and misspecified cases asymptotically
coincide. In other words, we provide an $o(1)$ characterization of the
distribution-free (or PAC) regret in this case -- the first such result as far
as we know. We recall that the worst-case (or individual-sequence) regret in
this case is larger by an additive constant ${d\over 2} + o(1)$. Surprisingly,
neither the traditional Bayesian estimators, nor the Shtarkov&#x27;s normalized
maximum likelihood achieve the PAC regret and our estimator requires special
&quot;robustification&quot; against heavy-tailed data. In addition, we show two general
results for misspecified regret: the existence and uniqueness of the optimal
estimator, and the bound sandwiching the misspecified regret between
well-specified regrets with (asymptotically) close hypotheses classes.</span>

to calculate the pose of a device with respect to an initial location. The
resulting global pose may be used to formulate a second, consistency based,
loss term in a deep odometry setting. In such cases where multiple losses are
imposed on a network, the uncertainty over each output can be derived to weigh
the different loss terms in a maximum likelihood setting. However, when
imposing a constraint on the integrated transformation, due to how only
odometry is estimated at each iteration of the algorithm, there is no
information about the uncertainty associated with the global pose to weigh the
global loss term. In this paper, we associate uncertainties with the output
poses of a deep odometry network and propagate the uncertainties through each
iteration. Our goal is to use the estimated covariance matrix at each
incremental step to weigh the loss at the corresponding step while weighting
the global loss term using the compounded uncertainty. This formulation
provides an adaptive method to weigh the incremental and integrated loss terms
against each other, noting the increase in uncertainty as new estimates arrive.
We provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of pose estimates and show
that our method surpasses the accuracy of the state-of-the-art Visual Odometry
approaches. Then, uncertainty estimates are evaluated and comparisons against
fixed baselines are provided. Finally, the uncertainty values are used in a
realistic example to show the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification for
localization.</span>

                                        <span>Over the last few decades, various methods have been proposed for estimating
prediction intervals in regression settings, including Bayesian methods,
ensemble methods, direct interval estimation methods and conformal prediction
methods. An important issue is the calibration of these methods: the generated
prediction intervals should have a predefined coverage level, without being
overly conservative. In this work, we review the above four classes of methods
from a conceptual and experimental point of view. Results on benchmark data
sets from various domains highlight large fluctuations in performance from one
data set to another. These observations can be attributed to the violation of
certain assumptions that are inherent to some classes of methods. We illustrate
how conformal prediction can be used as a general calibration procedure for
methods that deliver poor results without a calibration step.</span>

microstructure is a fundamental problem in homogenization. In this work we
propose a graph convolutional neural network that utilizes the discretized
representation of the initial microstructure directly, without segmentation or
clustering. Compared to feature-based and pixel-based convolutional neural
network models, the proposed method has a number of advantages: (a) it is deep
in that it does not require featurization but can benefit from it, (b) it has a
simple implementation with standard convolutional filters and layers, (c) it
works natively on unstructured and structured grid data without interpolation
(unlike pixel-based convolutional neural networks), and (d) it preserves
rotational invariance like other graph-based convolutional neural networks. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed network and compare it to
traditional pixel-based convolution neural network models and feature-based
graph convolutional neural networks on three large datasets.</span>

be used for many digital library tasks, such as analyzing citation networks and
predicting research trends. Automatic metadata extraction is important to build
scalable digital library search engines. Most existing methods are designed for
born-digital documents, so they often fail to extract metadata from scanned
documents such as for ETDs. Traditional sequence tagging methods mainly rely on
text-based features. In this paper, we propose a conditional random field (CRF)
model that combines text-based and visual features. To verify the robustness of
our model, we extended an existing corpus and created a new ground truth corpus
consisting of 500 ETD cover pages with human validated metadata. Our
experiments show that CRF with visual features outperformed both a heuristic
and a CRF model with only text-based features. The proposed model achieved
81.3%-96% F1 measure on seven metadata fields. The data and source code are
publicly available on Google Drive (https://tinyurl.com/y8kxzwrp) and a GitHub

                                        <span>Explaining the surprising generalization performance of deep neural networks
is an active and important line of research in theoretical machine learning.
Influential work by Arora et al. (ICML&#x27;18) showed that, noise stability
properties of deep nets occurring in practice can be used to provably compress
model representations. They then argued that the small representations of
compressed networks imply good generalization performance albeit only of the
compressed nets. Extending their compression framework to yield generalization
bounds for the original uncompressed networks remains elusive.

Our main contribution is the establishment of a compression-based framework
for proving generalization bounds. The framework is simple and powerful enough
to extend the generalization bounds by Arora et al. to also hold for the
original network. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we also show
that it allows us to give simple proofs of the strongest known generalization
bounds for other popular machine learning models, namely Support Vector
Machines and Boosting.</span>

                                        <span>We study computational hardness of feature and conjunction search through the
lens of circuit complexity. Let $x &#x3D; (x_1, ... , x_n)$ (resp., $y &#x3D; (y_1, ... ,
y_n)$) be Boolean variables each of which takes the value one if and only if a
neuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply
formulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\rm
FTR}_n(x) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i$ and ${\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) &#x3D; \bigvee_{i&#x3D;1}^n x_i
\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).

We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed &#x3D; o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.</span>

machine learning applications such as processing of surveys and in different
medical applications. Recently, Gaussian copula models have been suggested as a
means of performing imputation of missing values using a probabilistic
framework. While the present Gaussian copula models have shown to yield state
of the art performance, they have two limitations: they are based on an
approximation that is fast but may be imprecise and they do not support
unordered multinomial variables. We address the first limitation using direct
and arbitrarily precise approximations both for model estimation and imputation
by using randomized quasi-Monte Carlo procedures. The method we provide has
lower errors for the estimated model parameters and the imputed values,
compared to previously proposed methods. We also extend the previous Gaussian
copula models to include unordered multinomial variables in addition to the
present support of ordinal, binary, and continuous variables.</span>

                                        <span>Disparate treatment occurs when a machine learning model yields different
decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional
space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent
expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by
solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds
for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a
group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this
effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on
various computer vision tasks. The ability of capturing short- and long-range
visual dependencies through self-attention is arguably the main source for the
success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead,
especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection). In
this paper, we present focal self-attention, a new mechanism that incorporates
both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions. Using this new
mechanism, each token attends the closest surrounding tokens at fine
granularity but the tokens far away at coarse granularity, and thus can capture
both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively.
With focal self-attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer
models, called Focal Transformer, which achieves superior performance over the
state-of-the-art vision Transformers on a range of public image classification
and object detection benchmarks. In particular, our Focal Transformer models
with a moderate size of 51.1M and a larger size of 89.8M achieve 83.5 and 83.8
Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224x224 resolution.
Using Focal Transformers as the backbones, we obtain consistent and substantial
improvements over the current state-of-the-art Swin Transformers for 6
different object detection methods trained with standard 1x and 3x schedules.
Our largest Focal Transformer yields 58.7/58.9 box mAPs and 50.9/51.3 mask mAPs
on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and 55.4 mIoU on ADE20K for semantic segmentation,
creating new SoTA on three of the most challenging computer vision tasks.</span>

label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few
explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch&#x27;s Postulates, the
foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we
propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical
diagnosis. By determining and isolating the neuron activation patterns on which
diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector relies to make decisions, we demonstrate the
direct relation between the isolated neuron activation and lesions for a
pathological explanation. To be specific, we first define novel pathological
descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial
and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded
in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically
plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even
arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated
lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly
related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both
qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods.
Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our
second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data
augmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Contextual multi-armed bandit has shown to be an effective tool in
recommender systems. In this paper, we study a novel problem of multi-facet
bandits involving a group of bandits, each characterizing the users&#x27; needs from
one unique aspect. In each round, for the given user, we need to select one arm
from each bandit, such that the combination of all arms maximizes the final
reward. This problem can find immediate applications in E-commerce, healthcare,
etc. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm, named MuFasa, which
utilizes an assembled neural network to jointly learn the underlying reward
functions of multiple bandits. It estimates an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
linked with the expected reward to balance between exploitation and
exploration. Under mild assumptions, we provide the regret analysis of MuFasa.
It can achieve the near-optimal $\widetilde{ \mathcal{O}}((K+1)\sqrt{T})$
regret bound where $K$ is the number of bandits and $T$ is the number of played
rounds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to show that MuFasa
outperforms strong baselines on real-world data sets.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a strong classifier using limited
labeled examples. Many existing works take the meta-learning approach, sampling
few-shot tasks in turn and optimizing the few-shot learner&#x27;s performance on
classifying the query examples. In this paper, we point out two potential
weaknesses of this approach. First, the sampled query examples may not provide
sufficient supervision for the few-shot learner. Second, the effectiveness of
meta-learning diminishes sharply with increasing shots (i.e., the number of
training examples per class). To resolve these issues, we propose a novel
objective to directly train the few-shot learner to perform like a strong
classifier. Concretely, we associate each sampled few-shot task with a strong
classifier, which is learned with ample labeled examples. The strong classifier
has a better generalization ability and we use it to supervise the few-shot
learner. We present an efficient way to construct the strong classifier, making
our proposed objective an easily plug-and-play term to existing meta-learning
based FSL methods. We validate our approach in combinations with many
representative meta-learning methods. On several benchmark datasets including
miniImageNet and tiredImageNet, our approach leads to a notable improvement
across a variety of tasks. More importantly, with our approach, meta-learning
based FSL methods can consistently outperform non-meta-learning based ones,
even in a many-shot setting, greatly strengthening their applicability.</span>

                                        <span>Sentiment quantification is the task of estimating the relative frequency (or
&quot;prevalence&quot;) of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral,
Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts; this is especially important when
these texts are tweets, since most sentiment classification endeavours carried
out on Twitter data actually have quantification (and not the classification of
individual tweets) as their ultimate goal. It is well-known that solving
quantification via &quot;classify and count&quot; (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled
items via a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned
to a given class) is suboptimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate
quantification methods exist. In 2016, Gao and Sebastiani carried out a
systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment
quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimental protocol
followed in that work is flawed, and that its results are thus unreliable. We
now re-evaluate those quantification methods on the very same datasets, this
time following a now consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol,
that involves 5775 as many experiments as run in the original study. Our
experimentation yields results dramatically different from those obtained by
Gao and Sebastiani, and thus provide a different, much more solid understanding
of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.</span>

                                        <span>One of the key issues for imitation learning lies in making policy learned
from limited samples to generalize well in the whole state-action space. This
problem is much more severe in high-dimensional state environments, such as
game playing with raw pixel inputs. Under this situation, even state-of-the-art
adversary-based imitation learning algorithms fail. Through empirical studies,
we find that the main cause lies in the failure of training a powerful
discriminator to generate meaningful rewards in high-dimensional environments.
Although it seems that dimensionality reduction can help, a straightforward
application of off-the-shelf methods cannot achieve good performance. In this
work, we show in theory that the balance between dimensionality reduction and
discriminative training is essential for effective learning. To achieve this
target, we propose HashReward, which utilizes the idea of supervised hashing to
realize such an ideal balance. Experimental results show that HashReward could
outperform state-of-the-art methods for a large gap under the challenging
high-dimensional environments.</span>

deep network architectures to graph and relational data. However, given the
increasing size of industrial datasets, in many practical situations the
message passing computations required for sharing information across GNN layers
are no longer scalable. Although various sampling methods have been introduced
to approximate full-graph training within a tractable budget, there remain
unresolved complications such as high variances and limited theoretical
guarantees. To address these issues, we build upon existing work and treat GNN
neighbor sampling as a multi-armed bandit problem but with a newly-designed
reward function that introduces some degree of bias designed to reduce variance
and avoid unstable, possibly-unbounded pay outs. And unlike prior bandit-GNN
use cases, the resulting policy leads to near-optimal regret while accounting
for the GNN training dynamics introduced by SGD. From a practical standpoint,
this translates into lower variance estimates and competitive or superior test
accuracy across several benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>The ability to transfer a policy from one environment to another is a
promising avenue for efficient robot learning in realistic settings where task
supervision is not available. This can allow us to take advantage of
environments well suited for training, such as simulators or laboratories, to
learn a policy for a real robot in a home or office. To succeed, such policy
transfer must overcome both the visual domain gap (e.g. different illumination
or background) and the dynamics domain gap (e.g. different robot calibration or
modelling error) between source and target environments. However, prior policy
transfer approaches either cannot handle a large domain gap or can only address
one type of domain gap at a time. In this paper, we propose a novel policy
transfer method with iterative &quot;environment grounding&quot;, IDAPT, that alternates
between (1) directly minimizing both visual and dynamics domain gaps by
grounding the source environment in the target environment domains, and (2)
training a policy on the grounded source environment. This iterative training
progressively aligns the domains between the two environments and adapts the
policy to the target environment. Once trained, the policy can be directly
executed on the target environment. The empirical results on locomotion and
robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach can effectively
transfer a policy across visual and dynamics domain gaps with minimal
supervision and interaction with the target environment. Videos and code are

                                        <span>An effective approach to exploration in reinforcement learning is to rely on
an agent&#x27;s uncertainty over the optimal policy, which can yield near-optimal
exploration strategies in tabular settings. However, in non-tabular settings
that involve function approximators, obtaining accurate uncertainty estimates
is almost as challenging a problem. In this paper, we highlight that value
estimates are easily biased and temporally inconsistent. In light of this, we
propose a novel method for estimating uncertainty over the value function that
relies on inducing a distribution over temporal difference errors. This
exploration signal controls for state-action transitions so as to isolate
uncertainty in value that is due to uncertainty over the agent&#x27;s parameters.
Because our measure of uncertainty conditions on state-action transitions, we
cannot act on this measure directly. Instead, we incorporate it as an intrinsic
reward and treat exploration as a separate learning problem, induced by the
agent&#x27;s temporal difference uncertainties. We introduce a distinct exploration
policy that learns to collect data with high estimated uncertainty, which gives
rise to a curriculum that smoothly changes throughout learning and vanishes in
the limit of perfect value estimates. We evaluate our method on hard
exploration tasks, including Deep Sea and Atari 2600 environments and find that
our proposed form of exploration facilitates both diverse and deep exploration.</span>

                                        <span>We study a decentralized channel allocation problem in an ad-hoc Internet of
Things network underlaying on the spectrum licensed to a primary cellular
network. In the considered network, the impoverished channel sensing/probing
capability and computational resource on the IoT devices make them difficult to
acquire the detailed Channel State Information (CSI) for the shared multiple
channels. In practice, the unknown patterns of the primary users&#x27; transmission
activities and the time-varying CSI (e.g., due to small-scale fading or device
mobility) also cause stochastic changes in the channel quality. Decentralized
IoT links are thus expected to learn channel conditions online based on partial
observations, while acquiring no information about the channels that they are
not operating on. They also have to reach an efficient, collision-free solution
of channel allocation with limited coordination. Our study maps this problem
into a contextual multi-player, multi-armed bandit game, and proposes a purely
decentralized, three-stage policy learning algorithm through trial-and-error.
Theoretical analyses shows that the proposed scheme guarantees the IoT links to
jointly converge to the social optimal channel allocation with a sub-linear
(i.e., polylogarithmic) regret with respect to the operational time.
Simulations demonstrate that it strikes a good balance between efficiency and
network scalability when compared with the other state-of-the-art decentralized
bandit algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>In Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL) an agent is trained on a set of
tasks to prepare for and learn faster in new, unseen, but related tasks. The
training tasks are usually hand-crafted to be representative of the expected
distribution of test tasks and hence all used in training. We show that given a
set of training tasks, learning can be both faster and more effective (leading
to better performance in the test tasks), if the training tasks are
appropriately selected. We propose a task selection algorithm,
Information-Theoretic Task Selection (ITTS), based on information theory, which
optimizes the set of tasks used for training in meta-RL, irrespectively of how
they are generated. The algorithm establishes which training tasks are both
sufficiently relevant for the test tasks, and different enough from one
another. We reproduce different meta-RL experiments from the literature and
show that ITTS improves the final performance in all of them.</span>

                                        <span>While theoretically appealing, the application of the Wasserstein distance to
large-scale machine learning problems has been hampered by its prohibitive
computational cost. The sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants improve
the computational efficiency through the random projection, yet they suffer
from low accuracy if the number of projections is not sufficiently large,
because the majority of projections result in trivially small values. In this
work, we propose a new family of distance metrics, called augmented sliced
Wasserstein distances (ASWDs), constructed by first mapping samples to
higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks. It is
derived from a key observation that (random) linear projections of samples
residing on these hypersurfaces would translate to much more flexible nonlinear
projections in the original sample space, so they can capture complex
structures of the data distribution. We show that the hypersurfaces can be
optimized by gradient ascent efficiently. We provide the condition under which
the ASWD is a valid metric and show that this can be obtained by an injective
neural network architecture. Numerical results demonstrate that the ASWD
significantly outperforms other Wasserstein variants for both synthetic and
real-world problems.</span>

probability distributions from finite samples. Our main results establish the
convergence rates of GANs under a collection of integral probability metrics
defined through H\&quot;older classes, including the Wasserstein distance as a
special case. We also show that GANs are able to adaptively learn data
distributions with low-dimensional structures or have H\&quot;older densities, when
the network architectures are chosen properly. In particular, for distributions
concentrated around a low-dimensional set, we show that the learning rates of
GANs do not depend on the high ambient dimension, but on the lower intrinsic

                                        <span>Deep predictive models often make use of spurious correlations between the
label and the covariates that differ between training and test distributions.
In many classification tasks, spurious correlations are induced by a changing
relationship between the label and some nuisance variables correlated with the
covariates. For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the
background, which is the nuisance, can predict the type of animal, but this
nuisance label relationship does not always hold. This nuisance-label
relationship does not always hold. We formalize a family of distributions that
only differ in the nuisance-label relationship and and introduce a distribution
where this relationship is broken called the nuisance-randomized distribution.
We introduce a set of predictive models built from the nuisance-randomized
distribution with representations, that when conditioned on, do not correlate
the label and the nuisance. For models in this set, we lower bound the
performance for any member of the family with the mutual information between
the representation and the label under the nuisance-randomized distribution. To
build predictive models that maximize the performance lower bound, we develop
Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NURD). We evaluate NURD on a synthetic
example, colored-MNIST, and classifying chest X-rays. When using non-lung
patches as the nuisance in classifying chest X-rays, NURD produces models that
predict pneumonia under strong spurious correlations.</span>

attack (e.g., PGD, Carlini-Wagner or clean). To achieve this, we extract
statistical profiles, which we term as anomaly feature vectors, from a set of

among several types of adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD versus Carlini-Wagner)

                                        <span>A method for nonlinear topology identification is proposed, based on the
assumption that a collection of time series are generated in two steps: i) a
vector autoregressive process in a latent space, and ii) a nonlinear,
component-wise, monotonically increasing observation mapping. The latter
mappings are assumed invertible, and are modelled as shallow neural networks,
so that their inverse can be numerically evaluated, and their parameters can be
learned using a technique inspired in deep learning. Due to the function
inversion, the back-propagation step is not straightforward, and this paper
explains the steps needed to calculate the gradients applying implicit
differentiation. Whereas the model explainability is the same as that for
linear VAR processes, preliminary numerical tests show that the prediction
error becomes smaller.</span>

precision medicine; as such, we address the need for statistical methods that
provide actionable inference for a single unit at any point in time. We aim to
learn an optimal, unknown choice of the controlled components of the design in
order to optimize the expected outcome; with that, we adapt the randomization
mechanism for future time-point experiments based on the data collected on the
individual over time. Our results demonstrate that one can learn the optimal
rule based on a single sample, and thereby adjust the design at any point t
with valid inference for the mean target parameter. This work provides several
contributions to the field of statistical precision medicine. First, we define
a general class of averages of conditional causal parameters defined by the
current context for the single unit time-series data. We define a nonparametric
model for the probability distribution of the time-series under few
assumptions, and aim to fully utilize the sequential randomization in the
estimation procedure via the double robust structure of the efficient influence
curve of the proposed target parameter. We present multiple
exploration-exploitation strategies for assigning treatment, and methods for
estimating the optimal rule. Lastly, we present the study of the data-adaptive
inference on the mean under the optimal treatment rule, where the target
parameter adapts over time in response to the observed context of the
individual. Our target parameter is pathwise differentiable with an efficient
influence function that is doubly robust - which makes it easier to estimate
than previously proposed variations. We characterize the limit distribution of
our estimator under a Donsker condition expressed in terms of a notion of
bracketing entropy adapted to martingale settings.</span>

                                        <span>The limit order book (LOB) depicts the fine-grained demand and supply
relationship for financial assets and is widely used in market microstructure
studies. Nevertheless, the availability and high cost of LOB data restrict its
wider application. The LOB recreation model (LOBRM) was recently proposed to
bridge this gap by synthesizing the LOB from trades and quotes (TAQ) data.
However, in the original LOBRM study, there were two limitations: (1)
experiments were conducted on a relatively small dataset containing only one
day of LOB data; and (2) the training and testing were performed in a
non-chronological fashion, which essentially re-frames the task as
interpolation and potentially introduces lookahead bias. In this study, we
extend the research on LOBRM and further validate its use in real-world
application scenarios. We first advance the workflow of LOBRM by (1) adding a
time-weighted z-score standardization for the LOB and (2) substituting the
ordinary differential equation kernel with an exponential decay kernel to lower
computation complexity. Experiments are conducted on the extended LOBSTER
dataset in a chronological fashion, as it would be used in a real-world
application. We find that (1) LOBRM with decay kernel is superior to
traditional non-linear models, and module ensembling is effective; (2)
prediction accuracy is negatively related to the volatility of order volumes
resting in the LOB; (3) the proposed sparse encoding method for TAQ exhibits
good generalization ability and can facilitate manifold tasks; and (4) the
influence of stochastic drift on prediction accuracy can be alleviated by
increasing historical samples.</span>

                                        <span>Optimization in the latent space of variational autoencoders is a promising
approach to generate high-dimensional discrete objects that maximize an
expensive black-box property (e.g., drug-likeness in molecular generation,
function approximation with arithmetic expressions). However, existing methods
lack robustness as they may decide to explore areas of the latent space for
which no data was available during training and where the decoder can be
unreliable, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid objects. We
propose to leverage the epistemic uncertainty of the decoder to guide the
optimization process. This is not trivial though, as a naive estimation of
uncertainty in the high-dimensional and structured settings we consider would
result in high estimator variance. To solve this problem, we introduce an
importance sampling-based estimator that provides more robust estimates of
epistemic uncertainty. Our uncertainty-guided optimization approach does not
require modifications of the model architecture nor the training process. It
produces samples with a better trade-off between black-box objective and
validity of the generated samples, sometimes improving both simultaneously. We
illustrate these advantages across several experimental settings in digit
generation, arithmetic expression approximation and molecule generation for
drug design.</span>

to train a machine learning model over data distributed across multiple
workers. However, a fraction of these workers may deviate from the prescribed
algorithm and send arbitrary messages. While this problem has received
significant attention recently, most current defenses assume that the workers
have identical data. For realistic cases when the data across workers are
heterogeneous (non-iid), we design new attacks which circumvent current
defenses, leading to significant loss of performance. We then propose a simple
resampling scheme that adapts existing robust algorithms to heterogeneous
datasets at a negligible computational cost. We also theoretically and
experimentally validate our approach, showing that combining resampling with
existing robust algorithms is effective against challenging attacks. Our work
is the first to establish guaranteed convergence for the non-iid Byzantine

approached as a sequence tagging problem by classifying each recognized input
token into one of the IOB (Inside, Outside, and Beginning) categories. However,
such problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it cannot easily
handle complex spatial relationships and (2) it is not suitable for highly
structured information, which are nevertheless frequently observed in
real-world document images. To tackle these issues, we first formulate the IE
task as spatial dependency parsing problem that focuses on the relationship
among text tokens in the documents. Under this setup, we then propose SPADE
(SPAtial DEpendency parser) that models highly complex spatial relationships
and an arbitrary number of information layers in the documents in an end-to-end
manner. We evaluate it on various kinds of documents such as receipts, name
cards, forms, and invoices, and show that it achieves a similar or better

that generate the observed data will often react to the decisions of the
learner. For example, a data source may have some incentive for the algorithm
to provide a particular label (e.g. approve a bank loan), and manipulate their
features accordingly. Work in strategic classification and decision-dependent
distributions seeks to characterize the closed-loop behavior of deploying
learning algorithms by explicitly considering the effect of the classifier on
the underlying data distribution. More recently, works in performative
prediction seek to classify the closed-loop behavior by considering general
properties of the mapping from classifier to data distribution, rather than an
explicit form. Building on this notion, we analyze repeated risk minimization
as the perturbed trajectories of the gradient flows of performative risk
minimization. We consider the case where there may be multiple local minimizers
of performative risk, motivated by real world situations where the initial
conditions may have significant impact on the long-term behavior of the system.
As a motivating example, we consider a company whose current employee
demographics affect the applicant pool they interview: the initial demographics
of the company can affect the long-term hiring policies of the company. We
provide sufficient conditions to characterize the region of attraction for the
various equilibria in this settings. Additionally, we introduce the notion of
performative alignment, which provides a geometric condition on the convergence
of repeated risk minimization to performative risk minimizers.</span>

learned by imitating policies for the corresponding fully observed Markov
decision processes. Unfortunately, existing approaches for this kind of
imitation learning have a serious flaw: the expert does not know what the
trainee cannot see, and so may encourage actions that are sub-optimal, even
unsafe, under partial information. We derive an objective to instead train the
expert to maximize the expected reward of the imitating agent policy, and use
it to construct an efficient algorithm, adaptive asymmetric DAgger (A2D), that
jointly trains the expert and the agent. We show that A2D produces an expert
policy that the agent can safely imitate, in turn outperforming policies
learned by imitating a fixed expert.</span>

recommend marketing content for multiple pages in sequence. Different from
general sequential decision making process, the use cases have a simpler flow
where customers per seeing recommended content on each page can only return
feedback as moving forward in the process or dropping from it until a
termination state. We refer to this type of problems as sequential decision
making in linear--flow. We propose to formulate the problem as an MDP with
Bandits where Bandits are employed to model the transition probability matrix.
At recommendation time, we use Thompson sampling (TS) to sample the transition
probabilities and allocate the best series of actions with analytical solution
through exact dynamic programming. The way that we formulate the problem allows
us to leverage TS&#x27;s efficiency in balancing exploration and exploitation and
Bandit&#x27;s convenience in modeling actions&#x27; incompatibility. In the simulation
study, we observe the proposed MDP with Bandits algorithm outperforms
Q-learning with $\epsilon$-greedy and decreasing $\epsilon$, independent
Bandits, and interaction Bandits. We also find the proposed algorithm&#x27;s
performance is the most robust to changes in the across-page interdependence

they must learn new motion skills and adapt them to unseen situations on the
fly. This demands learning models that capture relevant motion patterns, while
offering enough flexibility to adapt the encoded skills to new requirements,
such as dynamic obstacle avoidance. We introduce a Riemannian manifold
perspective on this problem, and propose to learn a Riemannian manifold from
human demonstrations on which geodesics are natural motion skills. We realize
this with a variational autoencoder (VAE) over the space of position and
orientations of the robot end-effector. Geodesic motion skills let a robot plan
movements from and to arbitrary points on the data manifold. They also provide
a straightforward method to avoid obstacles by redefining the ambient metric in
an online fashion. Moreover, geodesics naturally exploit the manifold resulting
from multiple--mode tasks to design motions that were not explicitly
demonstrated previously. We test our learning framework using a 7-DoF robotic
manipulator, where the robot satisfactorily learns and reproduces realistic
skills featuring elaborated motion patterns, avoids previously unseen
obstacles, and generates novel movements in multiple-mode settings.</span>

                                        <span>Two of the most prominent algorithms for solving unconstrained smooth games
are the classical stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGDA) and the recently
introduced stochastic consensus optimization (SCO) (Mescheder et al., 2017).
SGDA is known to converge to a stationary point for specific classes of games,
but current convergence analyses require a bounded variance assumption. SCO is
used successfully for solving large-scale adversarial problems, but its
convergence guarantees are limited to its deterministic variant. In this work,
we introduce the expected co-coercivity condition, explain its benefits, and
provide the first last-iterate convergence guarantees of SGDA and SCO under
this condition for solving a class of stochastic variational inequality
problems that are potentially non-monotone. We prove linear convergence of both
methods to a neighborhood of the solution when they use constant step-size, and
we propose insightful stepsize-switching rules to guarantee convergence to the
exact solution. In addition, our convergence guarantees hold under the
arbitrary sampling paradigm, and as such, we give insights into the complexity
of minibatching.</span>

first an artificial dataset with a known bias is created and used to train
intentionally biased CNNs. The networks&#x27; decisions are then inspected using
attribution maps. Finally, meaningful metrics are used to measure the

                                        <span>Real-world problems often involve the optimization of several objectives
under multiple constraints. An example is the hyper-parameter tuning problem of
machine learning algorithms. In particular, the minimization of the estimation
of the generalization error of a deep neural network and at the same time the
minimization of its prediction time. We may also consider as a constraint that
the deep neural network must be implemented in a chip with an area below some
size. Here, both the objectives and the constraint are black boxes, i.e.,
functions whose analytical expressions are unknown and are expensive to
evaluate. Bayesian optimization (BO) methodologies have given state-of-the-art
results for the optimization of black-boxes. Nevertheless, most BO methods are
sequential and evaluate the objectives and the constraints at just one input
location, iteratively. Sometimes, however, we may have resources to evaluate
several configurations in parallel. Notwithstanding, no parallel BO method has
been proposed to deal with the optimization of multiple objectives under
several constraints. If the expensive evaluations can be carried out in
parallel (as when a cluster of computers is available), sequential evaluations
result in a waste of resources. This article introduces PPESMOC, Parallel
Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with
Constraints, an information-based batch method for the simultaneous
optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the
presence of several constraints. Iteratively, PPESMOC selects a batch of input
locations at which to evaluate the black-boxes so as to maximally reduce the
entropy of the Pareto set of the optimization problem. We present empirical
evidence in the form of synthetic, benchmark and real-world experiments that
illustrate the effectiveness of PPESMOC.</span>

                                        <span>The neural network with $1$-Lipschitz property based on $\ell_\infty$-dist
neuron has a theoretical guarantee in certified $\ell_\infty$ robustness.
However, due to the inherent difficulties in the training of the network, the
certified accuracy of previous work is limited. In this paper, we propose two
approaches to deal with these difficuties. Aiming at the characteristics of the
training process based on $\ell_\infty$-norm neural network, we introduce the
EMA method to improve the training process. Considering the randomness of the
training algorithm, we propose an ensemble method based on trained base models
that have the $1$-Lipschitz property and gain significant improvement in the
small parameter network. Moreover, we give the theoretical analysis of the
ensemble method based on the $1$-Lipschitz property on the certified
robustness, which ensures the effectiveness and stability of the algorithm. Our

                                        <span>In recent times, the trend in very large scale integration (VLSI) industry is
multi-dimensional, for example, reduction of energy consumption, occupancy of
less space, precise result, less power dissipation, faster response. To meet
these needs, the hardware architecture should be reliable and robust to these
problems. Recently, neural network and deep learning has been started to impact
the present research paradigm significantly which consists of parameters in the
order of millions, nonlinear function for activation, convolutional operation
for feature extraction, regression for classification, generative adversarial
networks. These operations involve huge calculation and memory overhead.
Presently available DSP processors are incapable of performing these operations
and they mostly face the problems, for example, memory overhead, performance
drop and compromised accuracy. Moreover, if a huge silicon area is powered to
accelerate the operation using parallel computation, the ICs will be having
significant chance of burning out due to the considerable generation of heat.
Hence, novel dark silicon constraint is developed to reduce the heat
dissipation without sacrificing the accuracy. Similarly, different algorithms
have been adapted to design a DSP processor compatible for fast performance in
neural network, activation function, convolutional neural network and
generative adversarial network. In this review, we illustrate the recent
developments in hardware for accelerating the efficient implementation of deep
learning networks with enhanced performance. The techniques investigated in
this review are expected to direct future research challenges of hardware
optimization for high-performance computations.</span>

problems, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of machine learning
and deep learning for the analysis of digital pathology and biopsy image
patches. However, traditional learning over patch-wise features using
convolutional neural networks limits the model when attempting to capture
global contextual information. The phenotypical and topological distribution of
constituent histological entities play a critical role in tissue diagnosis. As
such, graph data representations and deep learning have attracted significant
attention for encoding tissue representations, and capturing intra- and inter-
entity level interactions. In this review, we provide a conceptual grounding of
graph-based deep learning and discuss its current success for tumor
localization and classification, tumor invasion and staging, image retrieval,
and survival prediction. We provide an overview of these methods in a
systematic manner organized by the graph representation of the input image

                                        <span>Program synthesis from input-output examples has been a long-standing
challenge, and recent works have demonstrated some success in designing deep
neural networks for program synthesis. However, existing efforts in
input-output neural program synthesis have been focusing on domain-specific
languages, thus the applicability of previous approaches to synthesize code in
full-fledged popular programming languages, such as C, remains a question. The
main challenges lie in two folds. On the one hand, the program search space
grows exponentially when the syntax and semantics of the programming language
become more complex, which poses higher requirements on the synthesis
algorithm. On the other hand, increasing the complexity of the programming
language also imposes more difficulties on data collection, since building a
large-scale training set for input-output program synthesis require random
program generators to sample programs and input-output examples. In this work,
we take the first step to synthesize C programs from input-output examples. In
particular, we propose LaSynth, which learns the latent representation to
approximate the execution of partially generated programs, even if their
semantics are not well-defined. We demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing
elementary C code from input-output examples, and leveraging learned execution
significantly improves the prediction performance over existing approaches.
Meanwhile, compared to the randomly generated ground-truth programs, LaSynth
synthesizes more concise programs that resemble human-written code. We show
that training on these synthesized programs further improves the prediction
performance for both Karel and C program synthesis, indicating the promise of
leveraging the learned program synthesizer to improve the dataset quality for
input-output program synthesis.</span>

for prediction and certification that correctly accounts for multiple testing,

                                        <span>Training deep neural networks with an $L_0$ regularization is one of the
prominent approaches for network pruning or sparsification. The method prunes
the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero.
However, recent work of Gale et al. reveals that although this method yields
high compression rates on smaller datasets, it performs inconsistently on
large-scale learning tasks, such as ResNet50 on ImageNet. We analyze this
phenomenon through the lens of variational inference and find that it is likely
due to the independent modeling of binary gates, the mean-field approximation,
which is known in Bayesian statistics for its poor performance due to the crude
approximation. To mitigate this deficiency, we propose a dependency modeling of
binary gates, which can be modeled effectively as a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). We term our algorithm Dep-$L_0$ as it prunes networks via a
dependency-enabled $L_0$ regularization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10,
CIFAR100 and ImageNet with VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet56 show that our Dep-$L_0$
outperforms the original $L_0$-HC algorithm of Louizos et al. by a significant
margin, especially on ImageNet. Compared with the state-of-the-arts network
sparsification algorithms, our dependency modeling makes the $L_0$-based
sparsification once again very competitive on large-scale learning tasks. Our

                                        <span>In quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, the very first step is to
embed the data in quantum space known as Hilbert space. Developing quantum
kernel function (QKF), which defines the distances among the samples in the
Hilbert space, belongs to the fundamental topics for machine learning. In this
work, we propose the rescaled logarithmic fidelity (RLF) and a non-parametric
active learning in the quantum space, which we name as RLF-NAL. The rescaling
takes advantage of the non-linearity of the kernel to tune the mutual distances
of samples in the Hilbert space, and meanwhile avoids the exponentially-small
fidelities between quantum many-qubit states. We compare RLF-NAL with several
well-known non-parametric algorithms including naive Bayes classifiers,
$k$-nearest neighbors, and spectral clustering. Our method exhibits excellent
accuracy particularly for the unsupervised case with no labeled samples and the
few-shot cases with small numbers of labeled samples. With the visualizations
by t-SNE, our results imply that the machine learning in the Hilbert space
complies with the principles of maximal coding rate reduction, where the
low-dimensional data exhibit within-class compressibility, between-class
discrimination, and overall diversity. Our proposals can be applied to other
quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, including the methods using the
parametric models such as tensor networks, quantum circuits, and quantum neural
networks.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian processes remain popular as a flexible and expressive model class,
but the computational cost of kernel hyperparameter optimization stands as a
major limiting factor to their scaling and broader adoption. Recent work has
made great strides combining stochastic estimation with iterative numerical
techniques, essentially boiling down GP inference to the cost of (many)
matrix-vector multiplies. Preconditioning -- a highly effective step for any
iterative method involving matrix-vector multiplication -- can be used to
accelerate convergence and thus reduce bias in hyperparameter optimization.
Here, we prove that preconditioning has an additional benefit that has been
previously unexplored. It not only reduces the bias of the $\log$-marginal
likelihood estimator and its derivatives, but it also simultaneously can reduce
variance at essentially negligible cost. We leverage this result to derive
sample-efficient algorithms for GP hyperparameter optimization requiring as few
as $\mathcal{O}(\log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ instead of
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples to achieve error $\varepsilon$. Our
theoretical results enable provably efficient and scalable optimization of
kernel hyperparameters, which we validate empirically on a set of large-scale
benchmark problems. There, variance reduction via preconditioning results in an
order of magnitude speedup in hyperparameter optimization of exact GPs.</span>

constrained semi-definite programming (SDP) problems at scale using accelerated
non-convex programming. Our algorithm non-trivially combines acceleration
motions from convex optimization with coordinate power iteration and matrix
factorization techniques. The algorithm is extremely simple to implement, and
adds only a single extra hyperparameter -- momentum. We prove that our method
admits local linear convergence in the neighborhood of the optimum and always
converges to a first-order critical point. Experimentally, we showcase the
merits of our method on three major application domains: MaxCut, MaxSAT, and
MIMO signal detection. In all cases, our methodology provides significant
speedups over non-convex and convex SDP solvers -- 5X faster than
state-of-the-art non-convex solvers, and 9 to 10^3 X faster than convex SDP
solvers -- with comparable or improved solution quality.</span>

correlated features. The average feature ranking of the correlated group is
suppressed, which reduces interpretability and complicates feature selection.
In this paper we present ControlBurn, a feature selection algorithm that uses a
weighted LASSO-based feature selection method to prune unnecessary features
from tree ensembles, just as low-intensity fire reduces overgrown vegetation.
Like the linear LASSO, ControlBurn assigns all the feature importance of a
correlated group of features to a single feature. Moreover, the algorithm is
efficient and only requires a single training iteration to run, unlike
iterative wrapper-based feature selection methods. We show that ControlBurn
performs substantially better than feature selection methods with comparable
computational costs on datasets with correlated features.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from
a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally
attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between
the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher
model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to
mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits
the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper,
we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework
(IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and
exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer
the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model,
while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different
from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is
generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual
learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn
more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general
technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance.
Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the
performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning. The code and
models of IE-KD will be make publicly available at
https://github.com/yellowtownhz/IE-KD.</span>

                                        <span>In this big data era, we often confront large-scale data in many machine
learning tasks. A common approach for dealing with large-scale data is to build
a small summary, {\em e.g.,} coreset, that can efficiently represent the
original input. However, real-world datasets usually contain outliers and most
existing coreset construction methods are not resilient against outliers (in
particular, the outliers can be located arbitrarily in the space by an
adversarial attacker). In this paper, we propose a novel robust coreset method
for the {\em continuous-and-bounded learning} problem (with outliers) which
includes a broad range of popular optimization objectives in machine learning,
like logistic regression and $ k $-means clustering. Moreover, our robust
coreset can be efficiently maintained in fully-dynamic environment. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first robust and fully-dynamic coreset
construction method for these optimization problems. We also conduct the
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our robust coreset in practice.</span>

                                        <span>Telerobotic systems must adapt to new environmental conditions and deal with
high uncertainty caused by long-time delays. As one of the best alternatives to
human-level intelligence, Reinforcement Learning (RL) may offer a solution to
cope with these issues. This paper proposes to integrate RL with the Model
Mediated Teleoperation (MMT) concept. The teleoperator interacts with a
simulated virtual environment, which provides instant feedback. Whereas
feedback from the real environment is delayed, feedback from the model is
instantaneous, leading to high transparency. The MMT is realized in combination
with an intelligent system with two layers. The first layer utilizes Dynamic
Movement Primitives (DMP) which accounts for certain changes in the avatar
environment. And, the second layer addresses the problems caused by uncertainty
in the model using RL methods. Augmented reality was also provided to fuse the
avatar device and virtual environment models for the teleoperator. Implemented
on DLR&#x27;s Exodex Adam hand-arm haptic exoskeleton, the results show RL methods
are able to find different solutions when changes are applied to the object
position after the demonstration. The results also show DMPs to be effective at
adapting to new conditions where there is no uncertainty involved.</span>

                                        <span>Detection of colon polyps has become a trending topic in the intersecting
fields of machine learning and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The focus has mainly
been on per-frame classification. More recently, polyp segmentation has gained
attention in the medical community. Segmentation has the advantage of being
more accurate than per-frame classification or object detection as it can show
the affected area in greater detail. For our contribution to the EndoCV 2021
segmentation challenge, we propose two separate approaches. First, a
segmentation model named TriUNet composed of three separate UNet models.
Second, we combine TriUNet with an ensemble of well-known segmentation models,
namely UNet++, FPN, DeepLabv3, and DeepLabv3+, into a model called
DivergentNets to produce more generalizable medical image segmentation masks.
In addition, we propose a modified Dice loss that calculates loss only for a
single class when performing multiclass segmentation, forcing the model to
focus on what is most important. Overall, the proposed methods achieved the
best average scores for each respective round in the challenge, with TriUNet
being the winning model in Round I and DivergentNets being the winning model in
Round II of the segmentation generalization challenge at EndoCV 2021. The
implementation of our approach is made publicly available on GitHub.</span>

of skills, but it often struggles to solve tasks that require more temporally
extended reasoning. In this work, we propose to incorporate imagined subgoals
into policy learning to facilitate learning of complex tasks. Imagined subgoals
are predicted by a separate high-level policy, which is trained simultaneously
with the policy and its critic. This high-level policy predicts intermediate
states halfway to the goal using the value function as a reachability metric.
We don&#x27;t require the policy to reach these subgoals explicitly. Instead, we use
them to define a prior policy, and incorporate this prior into a KL-constrained
policy iteration scheme to speed up and regularize learning. Imagined subgoals
are used during policy learning, but not during test time, where we only apply
the learned policy. We evaluate our approach on complex robotic navigation and
manipulation tasks and show that it outperforms existing methods by a large
margin.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training tends to result in models that are less accurate on
natural (unperturbed) examples compared to standard models. This can be
attributed to either an algorithmic shortcoming or a fundamental property of
the training data distribution, which admits different solutions for optimal
standard and adversarial classifiers. In this work, we focus on the latter case
under a binary Gaussian mixture classification problem. Unlike earlier work, we
aim to derive the natural accuracy gap between the optimal Bayes and
adversarial classifiers, and study the effect of different distributional
parameters, namely separation between class centroids, class proportions, and
the covariance matrix, on the derived gap. We show that under certain
conditions, the natural error of the optimal adversarial classifier, as well as
the gap, are locally minimized when classes are balanced, contradicting the
performance of the Bayes classifier where perfect balance induces the worst
accuracy. Moreover, we show that with an $\ell_\infty$ bounded perturbation and
an adversarial budget of $\epsilon$, this gap is $\Theta(\epsilon^2)$ for the
worst-case parameters, which for suitably small $\epsilon$ indicates the
theoretical possibility of achieving robust classifiers with near-perfect
accuracy, which is rarely reflected in practical algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Benefiting from the powerful expressive capability of graphs, graph-based
approaches have achieved impressive performance in various biomedical
applications. Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among
samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings
for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not
easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the
complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these
factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about
the patient&#x27;s condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction.
To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated
with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate
the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity
between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix
manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured
through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized
with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among
samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable
to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group
of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed
and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In
addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide
more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and
inspiration for disease research.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer-based models are popularly used in natural language processing
(NLP). Its core component, self-attention, has aroused widespread interest. To
understand the self-attention mechanism, a direct method is to visualize the
attention map of a pre-trained model. Based on the patterns observed, a series
of efficient Transformers with different sparse attention masks have been
proposed. From a theoretical perspective, universal approximability of
Transformer-based models is also recently proved. However, the above
understanding and analysis of self-attention is based on a pre-trained model.
To rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance
of different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising
result is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important
compared with other attention positions. We provide a proof showing that these
diagonal elements can indeed be removed without deteriorating model
performance. Furthermore, we propose a Differentiable Attention Mask (DAM)
algorithm, which further guides the design of the SparseBERT. Extensive
experiments verify our interesting findings and illustrate the effect of the
proposed algorithm.</span>

out-of-sample directional movements of constituent stocks of the S&amp;P 500 from
January 1993 till December 2018 for intraday trading. We introduce a

handle complex tasks such as image classification, object recognition, natural
language processing etc. Consequently DNN structural vulnerabilities become
part of the security vulnerabilities in those systems. In this paper we study
the root cause of DNN adversarial examples. We examine the DNN response surface
to understand its classification boundary. Our study reveals the structural
problem of DNN classification boundary that leads to the adversarial examples.
Existing attack algorithms can generate from a handful to a few hundred
adversarial examples given one clean image. We show there are infinitely many
adversarial images given one clean sample, all within a small neighborhood of
the clean sample. We then define DNN uncertainty regions and show
transferability of adversarial examples is not universal. We also argue that
generalization error, the large sample theoretical guarantee established for
DNN, cannot adequately capture the phenomenon of adversarial examples. We need
new theory to measure DNN robustness.</span>

as anomaly detection, health monitoring, or maintenance scheduling. The amount
of data generated on windmill farms makes online learning the most viable
strategy to follow. Such settings require retraining the model each time a new
batch of data is available. However, update the model with the new information
is often very expensive to perform using traditional Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). In this paper, we use Long Short-term Cognitive Networks (LSTCNs) to
forecast windmill time series in online settings. These recently introduced
neural systems consist of chained Short-term Cognitive Network blocks, each
processing a temporal data chunk. The learning algorithm of these blocks is
based on a very fast, deterministic learning rule that makes LSTCNs suitable
for online learning tasks. The numerical simulations using a case study with
four windmills showed that our approach reported the lowest forecasting errors
with respect to a simple RNN, a Long Short-term Memory, a Gated Recurrent Unit,
and a Hidden Markov Model. What is perhaps more important is that the LSTCN
approach is significantly faster than these state-of-the-art models.</span>

collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations
under the privacy restrictions. As researchers try to support more machine
learning models with different privacy-preserving approaches, there is a
requirement in developing systems and infrastructures to ease the development

as PyTorch and TensorFlow that boost the development of deep learning,
federated learning systems (FLSs) are equivalently important, and face
challenges from various aspects such as effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy.
In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on federated learning
systems. To achieve smooth flow and guide future research, we introduce the
definition of federated learning systems and analyze the system components.
Moreover, we provide a thorough categorization for federated learning systems
according to six different aspects, including data distribution, machine
learning model, privacy mechanism, communication architecture, scale of
federation and motivation of federation. The categorization can help the design

designed for the average distortion measure. Therefore, it is vulnerable to
outliers in data, and can cause large maximum distortion in clusters. In this
work, we extend the objective function of the DP-means to $f$-separable

                                        <span>Recent advance in deep offline reinforcement learning (RL) has made it
possible to train strong robotic agents from offline datasets. However,
depending on the quality of the trained agents and the application being
considered, it is often desirable to fine-tune such agents via further online
interactions. In this paper, we observe that state-action distribution shift
may lead to severe bootstrap error during fine-tuning, which destroys the good
initial policy obtained via offline RL. To address this issue, we first propose
a balanced replay scheme that prioritizes samples encountered online while also
encouraging the use of near-on-policy samples from the offline dataset.
Furthermore, we leverage multiple Q-functions trained pessimistically offline,
thereby preventing overoptimism concerning unfamiliar actions at novel states
during the initial training phase. We show that the proposed method improves
sample-efficiency and final performance of the fine-tuned robotic agents on
various locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our code is available at:

learning tiered latent representations and latent spaces for molecular graphs
that explicitly represent and utilize groups (e.g., functional groups). This
enables the utilization and exploration of tiered molecular latent spaces,
either individually - the node (atom) tier, the group tier, or the graph
(molecule) tier - or jointly, as well as navigation across the tiers. In this
paper, we discuss the use of tiered graph autoencoders together with graph
prediction for molecular graphs. We show features of molecular graphs used, and
groups in molecular graphs identified for some sample molecules. We briefly
review graph prediction and the QM9 dataset for background information, and
discuss the use of tiered graph embeddings for graph prediction, particularly
weighted group pooling. We find that functional groups and ring groups
effectively capture and represent the chemical essence of molecular graphs
(structures). Further, tiered graph autoencoders and graph prediction together
provide effective, efficient and interpretable deep learning for molecular
graphs, with the former providing unsupervised, transferable learning and the
latter providing supervised, task-optimized learning.</span>

                                        <span>Momentum is a widely used technique for gradient-based optimizers in deep
learning. In this paper, we propose a decaying momentum (\textsc{Demon}) rule.
We conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of momentum decay methods
for modern neural network optimization, in addition to the most popular
learning rate decay schedules. Across 28 relevant combinations of models,
epochs, datasets, and optimizers, \textsc{Demon} achieves the highest number of
Top-1 and Top-3 finishes at 39\% and 85\% respectively, almost doubling the
second-placed learning rate cosine schedule at 17\% and 60\%, respectively.
\textsc{Demon} also outperforms other widely used schedulers including, but not
limited to, the learning rate step schedule, linear schedule, OneCycle
schedule, and exponential schedule. Compared with the widely used learning rate
step schedule, \textsc{Demon} is observed to be less sensitive to parameter
tuning, which is critical to training neural networks in practice. Results are
demonstrated across a variety of settings and architectures, including image
classification, generative models, and language models. \textsc{Demon} is easy
to implement, requires no additional tuning, and incurs almost no extra
computational overhead compared to the vanilla counterparts. Code is readily
available.</span>

challenging tasks directly from visual observations, generalizing learned
skills to novel environments remains very challenging. Extensive use of data
augmentation is a promising technique for improving generalization in RL, but
it is often found to decrease sample efficiency and can even lead to
divergence. In this paper, we investigate causes of instability when using data
augmentation in common off-policy RL algorithms. We identify two problems, both
rooted in high-variance Q-targets. Based on our findings, we propose a simple
yet effective technique for stabilizing this class of algorithms under
augmentation. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of image-based RL using
both ConvNets and Vision Transformers (ViT) on a family of benchmarks based on
DeepMind Control Suite, as well as in robotic manipulation tasks. Our method
greatly improves stability and sample efficiency of ConvNets under
augmentation, and achieves generalization results competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for image-based RL. We further show that our method
scales to RL with ViT-based architectures, and that data augmentation may be
especially important in this setting.</span>

relation to feature engineering. However, comparable efforts are instead
required to determine effective architectures. In addition, as the sizes of
networks have grown overly large, a considerable amount of resources is also
invested in reducing the sizes. The sparsification of an over-complete model
addresses these problems as it removes redundant components and connections. In
this study, we propose a fully differentiable sparsification method for deep
neural networks which allows parameters to be zero during training via
stochastic gradient descent. Thus, the proposed method can learn the sparsified
structure and weights of a network in an end-to-end manner. The method is
directly applicable to various modern deep neural networks and imposes minimum
modification to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first fully [sub-]differentiable sparsification method that zeroes out
parameters. It provides a foundation for future structure learning and model
compression methods.</span>

data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional input
features in the downstream task. In various application domains, including
computer vision, natural language processing and audio/speech signal
processing, a wide range of features where engineered through decades of
research efforts. As it turns out, learning to predict such features has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task leading to building useful
self-supervised representations that prove to be effective for downstream
tasks. However, methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks,
where each task targets a different group of features for better performance on
the downstream task have not been explored and understood properly. In fact,
the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally heavy experimental
procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of the number of pretext
tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group of pretext tasks among
a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates properly calibrated
weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered pretext tasks
during the self-supervised training process. The experiments conducted on
speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition validate our approach, as
the groups selected and weighted with our method perform better than classic
baselines, thus facilitating the selection and combination of relevant
pseudo-labels for self-supervised representation learning.</span>

implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial
attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a
misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet
efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event
sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters
for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two
types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the
filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks.
Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware
Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset
and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean
frames. The source code of all the proposed DVS-Attacks and noise filters is

learn chaos is lacking. Here, we employ a geometric perspective to show that
neural networks can efficiently model chaotic dynamics by becoming structurally
chaotic themselves. We first confirm neural network&#x27;s efficiency in emulating
chaos by showing that a parsimonious neural network trained only on few data
points can reconstruct strange attractors, extrapolate outside training data
boundaries, and accurately predict local divergence rates. We then posit that
the trained network&#x27;s map comprises sequential geometric stretching, rotation,

mixing and chaos, explaining why neural networks are naturally suitable to

models at scale across the enterprise in a range of financial analytics
applications. These lessons are presented in the form of antipatterns. Just as
design patterns codify best software engineering practices, antipatterns
provide a vocabulary to describe defective practices and methodologies. Here we
catalog and document numerous antipatterns in financial ML operations (MLOps).
Some antipatterns are due to technical errors, while others are due to not
having sufficient knowledge of the surrounding context in which ML results are
used. By providing a common vocabulary to discuss these situations, our intent
is that antipatterns will support better documentation of issues, rapid
communication between stakeholders, and faster resolution of problems. In
addition to cataloging antipatterns, we describe solutions, best practices, and
future directions toward MLOps maturity.</span>

                                        <span>While many real-world data streams imply that they change frequently in a
nonstationary way, most of deep learning methods optimize neural networks on
training data, and this leads to severe performance degradation when dataset
shift happens. However, it is less possible to annotate or inspect newly
streamed data by humans, and thus it is desired to measure model drift at
inference time in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a novel
method of model drift estimation by exploiting statistics of batch
normalization layer on unlabeled test data. To remedy possible sampling error
of streamed input data, we adopt low-rank approximation to each
representational layer. We show the effectiveness of our method not only on
dataset shift detection but also on model selection when there are multiple
candidate models among model zoo or training trajectories in an unsupervised
way. We further demonstrate the consistency of our method by comparing model
drift scores between different network architectures.</span>

general-purpose knowledge graphs as sources of background knowledge for the

exploitation strategies. We find that explicit strategies still outperform
latent ones and that the choice of the strategy has a greater impact on the
final alignment than the actual background dataset on which the strategy is

achieved consistently good results. Our best matcher configuration with

research topic, and recent years witnessed an increased performance from
supervised training using deep learning techniques. We propose to apply the
visual information corresponding to the singers&#x27; vocal activities to further
improve the quality of the separated vocal signals. The video frontend model
takes the input of mouth movement and fuses it into the feature embeddings of
an audio-based separation framework. To facilitate the network to learn
audiovisual correlation of singing activities, we add extra vocal signals
irrelevant to the mouth movement to the audio mixture during training. We
create two audiovisual singing performance datasets for training and
evaluation, respectively, one curated from audition recordings on the Internet,
and the other recorded in house. The proposed method outperforms audio-based
methods in terms of separation quality on most test recordings. This advantage
is especially pronounced when there are backing vocals in the accompaniment,
which poses a great challenge for audio-only methods.</span>

imitation learning (GAIL) algorithms to observation noise. Towards this
objective, we study the effect of local Lipschitzness of the discriminator and
the generator on the robustness of policies learned by GAIL. In many robotics
applications, the learned policies by GAIL typically suffer from a degraded
performance at test time since the observations from the environment might be
corrupted by noise. Hence, robustifying the learned policies against the
observation noise is of critical importance. To this end, we propose a
regularization method to induce local Lipschitzness in the generator and the
discriminator of adversarial imitation learning methods. We show that the
modified objective leads to learning significantly more robust policies.
Moreover, we demonstrate -- both theoretically and experimentally -- that
training a locally Lipschitz discriminator leads to a locally Lipschitz
generator, thereby improving the robustness of the resultant policy. We perform
extensive experiments on simulated robot locomotion environments from the
MuJoCo suite that demonstrate the proposed method learns policies that
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art generative adversarial imitation
learning algorithm when applied to test scenarios with noise-corrupted
observations.</span>

studied. The minimax rate of convergence for distributed estimation over a
given Besov class, which serves as a benchmark for the cost of adaptation, is
established. We then quantify the exact communication cost for adaptation and
construct an optimally adaptive procedure for distributed estimation over a
range of Besov classes. The results demonstrate significant differences between
nonparametric function estimation in the distributed setting and the

cannot be achieved for free in the distributed setting. The new technical tools

experiment setup and criteria for identifying the &quot;winning ticket&quot; in
literature. To reconcile such, we revisit the definition of lottery ticket
hypothesis, with comprehensive and more rigorous conditions. Under our new
definition, we show concrete evidence to clarify whether the winning ticket
exists across the major DNN architectures and/or applications. Through
extensive experiments, we perform quantitative analysis on the correlations
between winning tickets and various experimental factors, and empirically study
the patterns of our observations. We find that the key training
hyperparameters, such as learning rate and training epochs, as well as the
architecture characteristics such as capacities and residual connections, are
all highly correlated with whether and when the winning tickets can be
identified. Based on our analysis, we summarize a guideline for parameter
settings in regards of specific architecture characteristics, which we hope to

data reliability is missing values. Such data leads to inaccurate analysis and
wrong predictions. We propose an efficient technique to impute the missing
value in the dataset based on correlation called FCMI (Feature Correlation
based Missing Data Imputation). We have considered the correlation of the
attributes of the dataset, and that is our central idea. Our proposed algorithm
picks the highly correlated attributes of the dataset and uses these attributes
to build a regression model whose parameters are optimized such that the
correlation of the dataset is maintained. Experiments conducted on both
classification and regression datasets show that the proposed imputation
technique outperforms existing imputation algorithms.</span>

political events. Automated systems parse large volumes of text data to infer
or extract structured information that describes actors, actions, dates, times,

coordinates associated with events or locations described by a given text. We

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) allows edge devices to collectively learn a model
without directly sharing data within each device, thus preserving privacy and
eliminating the need to store data globally. While there are promising results
under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (iid) local
data, current state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from performance degradation
as the heterogeneity of local data across clients increases. To resolve this
issue, we propose a simple framework, Mean Augmented Federated Learning (MAFL),
where clients send and receive averaged local data, subject to the privacy
requirements of target applications. Under our framework, we propose a new
augmentation algorithm, named FedMix, which is inspired by a phenomenal yet
simple data augmentation method, Mixup, but does not require local raw data to
be directly shared among devices. Our method shows greatly improved performance
in the standard benchmark datasets of FL, under highly non-iid federated
settings, compared to conventional algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation has caught a lot of attention in Federated Learning
(FL) recently. It has the advantage for FL to train on heterogeneous clients
which have different data size and data structure. However, data samples across
all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed
(non-i.i.d), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of
federated learning. As FL randomly asks the clients to join the training
process and each client only learns from local non-i.i.d data, which makes
learning processing even slower. In order to solve this problem, an intuitive
idea is using the global model to guide local training. In this paper, we
propose a novel global knowledge distillation method, named FedGKD, which
learns the knowledge from past global models to tackle down the local bias
training problem. By learning from global knowledge and consistent with current
local models, FedGKD learns a global knowledge model in FL. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on
various CV datasets (CIFAR-10/100) and settings (non-i.i.d data). The
evaluation results show that FedGKD outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods.</span>

                                        <span>In real-world applications, data often come in a growing manner, where the
data volume and the number of classes may increase dynamically. This will bring
a critical challenge for learning: given the increasing data volume or the
number of classes, one has to instantaneously adjust the neural model capacity
to obtain promising performance. Existing methods either ignore the growing
nature of data or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a
given dataset, and thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures
for the changed data. To address this, we present a neural architecture
adaptation method, namely Adaptation eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust
previous architectures on the growing data. Specifically, we introduce an
architecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture for each data
snapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent between
current and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation
condition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding
unnecessary and time-consuming adjustments. Extensive experiments on two growth
scenarios (increasing data volume and number of classes) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

inherent potential of high-performance data compression and signal compressed
sensing. The main disadvantages of current autoencoders comprise the following
several aspects: the research objective is not data reconstruction but feature
representation; the performance evaluation of data recovery is neglected; it is
hard to achieve lossless data reconstruction by pure autoencoders, even by pure
deep learning. This paper aims for image reconstruction of autoencoders,
employs cascade decoders-based autoencoders, perfects the performance of image
reconstruction, approaches gradually lossless image recovery, and provides
solid theory and application basis for autoencoders-based image compression and
compressed sensing. The proposed serial decoders-based autoencoders include the
architectures of multi-level decoders and the related optimization algorithms.
The cascade decoders consist of general decoders, residual decoders,
adversarial decoders and their combinations. It is evaluated by the
experimental results that the proposed autoencoders outperform the classical
autoencoders in the performance of image reconstruction.</span>

whole story and features the most important scenes. Yet the importance of
scenes in a video is often subjective, and users should have the option of
customizing the summary by using natural language to specify what is important
to them. Further, existing models for fully automatic generic summarization
have not exploited available language models, which can serve as an effective
prior for saliency. This work introduces CLIP-It, a single framework for
addressing both generic and query-focused video summarization, typically
approached separately in the literature. We propose a language-guided
multimodal transformer that learns to score frames in a video based on their
importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined
query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense
video caption (for generic video summarization). Our model can be extended to
the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. We
outperform baselines and prior work by a significant margin on both standard
video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and a query-focused video
summarization dataset (QFVS). Particularly, we achieve large improvements in
the transfer setting, attesting to our method&#x27;s strong generalization

learning, exciting progress has been made recently. Despite achieving better
compression performance, existing end-to-end compression algorithms are still
designed towards better signal quality in terms of rate-distortion
optimization. In this paper, we show that the design and optimization of
network architecture could be further improved for compression towards machine
vision. We propose an inverted bottleneck structure for end-to-end compression
towards machine vision, which specifically accounts for efficient
representation of the semantic information. Moreover, we quest the capability
of optimization by incorporating the analytics accuracy into the optimization
process, and the optimality is further explored with generalized rate-accuracy
optimization in an iterative manner. We use object detection as a showcase for
end-to-end compression towards machine vision, and extensive experiments show
that the proposed scheme achieves significant BD-rate savings in terms of
analysis performance. Moreover, the promise of the scheme is also demonstrated
with strong generalization capability towards other machine vision tasks, due
to the enabling of signal-level reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>Clinical decision-making in oncology involves multimodal data such as
radiology scans, molecular profiling, histopathology slides, and clinical
factors. Despite the importance of these modalities individually, no deep
learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis.
Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse
multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to
combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities
(such as H&amp;E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a
comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality
are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the
information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal
orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by
incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS
in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly
outperforming (p&#x3D;0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median
C-index of 0.718 +/- 0.064. The prognostic model significantly stratifies
glioma patients by OS within clinical subsets, adding further granularity to
prognostic clinical grading and molecular subtyping.</span>

                                        <span>Recent pretraining models in Chinese neglect two important aspects specific
to the Chinese language: glyph and pinyin, which carry significant syntax and
semantic information for language understanding. In this work, we propose
ChineseBERT, which incorporates both the {\it glyph} and {\it pinyin}
information of Chinese characters into language model pretraining. The glyph
embedding is obtained based on different fonts of a Chinese character, being
able to capture character semantics from the visual features, and the pinyin
embedding characterizes the pronunciation of Chinese characters, which handles
the highly prevalent heteronym phenomenon in Chinese (the same character has
different pronunciations with different meanings). Pretrained on large-scale
unlabeled Chinese corpus, the proposed ChineseBERT model yields significant
performance boost over baseline models with fewer training steps. The porpsoed
model achieves new SOTA performances on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks,
including machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, text
classification, sentence pair matching, and competitive performances in named
entity recognition. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at
https://github.com/ShannonAI/ChineseBert.</span>

legal community and increase access to justice. The paper introduces Legal
Precedent Prediction (LPP), the task of predicting relevant passages from
precedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. To this
end, the paper showcases a BERT model, trained on 530,000 examples of legal
arguments made by U.S. federal judges, to predict relevant passages from
precedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. In 96% of
unseen test examples the correct target passage is among the top-10 predicted
passages. The same model is able to predict relevant precedent given a short
summary of a complex and unseen legal brief, predicting the precedent that was
actually cited by the brief&#x27;s co-author, former U.S. Solicitor General and
current U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.</span>

                                        <span>Commonsense inference to understand and explain human language is a
fundamental research problem in natural language processing. Explaining human
conversations poses a great challenge as it requires contextual understanding,
planning, inference, and several aspects of reasoning including causal,
temporal, and commonsense reasoning. In this work, we introduce CIDER -- a
manually curated dataset that contains dyadic dialogue explanations in the form
of implicit and explicit knowledge triplets inferred using contextual
commonsense inference. Extracting such rich explanations from conversations can
be conducive to improving several downstream applications. The annotated
triplets are categorized by the type of commonsense knowledge present (e.g.,
causal, conditional, temporal). We set up three different tasks conditioned on
the annotated dataset: Dialogue-level Natural Language Inference, Span
Extraction, and Multi-choice Span Selection. Baseline results obtained with
transformer-based models reveal that the tasks are difficult, paving the way
for promising future research. The dataset and the baseline implementations are

                                        <span>German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) forms
which differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, the
present indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports of
football matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective past
tense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core and
are licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occur
in. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script and
specific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. This
allows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, they
shift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genre
that comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decode
them. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning of
these phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution,
grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors are
Aktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with other
TAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of the
comprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have only
been partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored in
German.</span>

                                        <span>Social media platforms provide users the freedom of expression and a medium
to exchange information and express diverse opinions. Unfortunately, this has
also resulted in the growth of abusive content with the purpose of
discriminating people and targeting the most vulnerable communities such as
immigrants, LGBT, Muslims, Jews and women. Because abusive language is
subjective in nature, there might be highly polarizing topics or events
involved in the annotation of abusive contents such as hate speech (HS).
Therefore, we need novel approaches to model conflicting perspectives and
opinions coming from people with different personal and demographic
backgrounds. In this paper, we present an in-depth study to model polarized
opinions coming from different communities under the hypothesis that similar
characteristics (ethnicity, social background, culture etc.) can influence the
perspectives of annotators on a certain phenomenon. We believe that by relying
on this information, we can divide the annotators into groups sharing similar
perspectives. We can create separate gold standards, one for each group, to
train state-of-the-art deep learning models. We can employ an ensemble approach
to combine the perspective-aware classifiers from different groups to an
inclusive model. We also propose a novel resource, a multi-perspective English
language dataset annotated according to different sub-categories relevant for
characterising online abuse: hate speech, aggressiveness, offensiveness and
stereotype. By training state-of-the-art deep learning models on this novel
resource, we show how our approach improves the prediction performance of a
state-of-the-art supervised classifier.</span>

statistical language models are impressive not only for their performance, but
also - and quite crucially - because they are built entirely from correlations
in unstructured text data. The latter observation prompts a fundamental
question that lies at the heart of this paper: What mathematical structure
exists in unstructured text data? We put forth enriched category theory as a
natural answer. We show that sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet, such
as those found in a corpus of text, form a category enriched over
probabilities. We then address a second fundamental question: How can this
information be stored and modeled in a way that preserves the categorical
structure? We answer this by constructing a functor from our enriched category
of text to a particular enriched category of reduced density operators. The
latter leverages the Loewner order on positive semidefinite operators, which
can further be interpreted as a toy example of entailment.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of dialog systems
research. Standard language evaluation metrics are known to be ineffective for
evaluating dialog. As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,
dialog-specific metrics that correlate better with human judgements. Due to the
fast pace of research, many of these metrics have been assessed on different
datasets and there has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between
them. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of recently
proposed dialog evaluation metrics on a number of datasets. In this paper, 17
different automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different datasets.
Furthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify
their respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the
turn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for
different dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types
of response generation models (i.e., generative, retrieval, simple models and
state-of-the-art models), (5) taking into account the similarity of different
metrics and (6) exploring combinations of different metrics. This comprehensive
assessment offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation metrics in
general. It also suggests how to best assess evaluation metrics and indicates
promising directions for future work.</span>

content to include in their narratives. In this paper, we focus on supporting
writers in the news domain to develop event-centric narratives. Given an
incomplete narrative that specifies a main event and a context, we aim to
retrieve news articles that discuss relevant events that would enable the
continuation of the narrative. We formally define this task and propose a
retrieval dataset construction procedure that relies on existing news articles
to simulate incomplete narratives and relevant articles. Experiments on two
datasets derived from this procedure show that state-of-the-art lexical and
semantic rankers are not sufficient for this task. We show that combining those
with a ranker that ranks articles by reverse chronological order outperforms
those rankers alone. We also perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative
analysis of the results that sheds light on the characteristics of this task.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency
parsing problems (syntactic and discourse parsing) into a series of conditional
splitting decisions. Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability
distribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports
efficient top-down decoding, which is linear in number of nodes. The
conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference
facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured
inference. Crucially, for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation,
discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows
us to perform discourse parsing without requiring segmentation as a
pre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the
standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained
representations and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more
computationally expensive than ours. In discourse parsing, our method
outperforms SoTA by a good margin.</span>

rely on text annotation, such as human generated captions or machine generated
automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the
Audio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a
shared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To
circumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations
from randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train
AVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,
and evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet&#x27;s learned
representations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn
audio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly
processes raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a
multi-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval. Our code,
data, and trained models will be released at avlnet.csail.mit.edu</span>

                                        <span>In recent years there has been a special interest in word embeddings as a new
approach to convert words to vectors. It has been a focal point to understand
how much of the semantics of the the words has been transferred into embedding
vectors. This is important as the embedding is going to be used as the basis
for downstream NLP applications and it will be costly to evaluate the
application end-to-end in order to identify quality of the used embedding
model. Generally the word embeddings are evaluated through a number of tests,
including analogy test. In this paper we propose a test framework for Persian
embedding models. Persian is a low resource language and there is no rich
semantic benchmark to evaluate word embedding models for this language. In this
paper we introduce an evaluation framework including a hand crafted Persian SAT
based analogy dataset, a colliquial test set (specific to Persian) and a
benchmark to study the impact of various parameters on the semantic evaluation
task.</span>

                                        <span>Conversational Question Simplification (CQS) aims to simplify self-contained
questions into conversational ones by incorporating some conversational
characteristics, e.g., anaphora and ellipsis. Existing maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) based methods often get trapped in easily learned tokens as
all tokens are treated equally during training. In this work, we introduce a
Reinforcement Iterative Sequence Editing (RISE) framework that optimizes the
minimum Levenshtein distance (MLD) through explicit editing actions. RISE is
able to pay attention to tokens that are related to conversational
characteristics. To train RISE, we devise an Iterative Reinforce Training (IRT)
algorithm with a Dynamic Programming based Sampling (DPS) process to improve
exploration. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that RISE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on
unseen data.</span>

the well-being of people. The eRisk workshop has been at the forefront of
enabling interdisciplinary research in developing computational methods to
automatically estimate early risk factors for mental issues such as depression,
self-harm, anorexia and pathological gambling. In this paper, we present the

function in two training methods of auto-regressive models, i.e., teacher
forcing and scheduled sampling. In this paper, we propose mixed cross entropy
loss (mixed CE) as a substitute for CE in both training approaches. In teacher
forcing, the model trained with CE regards the translation problem as a
one-to-one mapping process, while in mixed CE this process can be relaxed to
one-to-many. In scheduled sampling, we show that mixed CE has the potential to
encourage the training and testing behaviours to be similar to each other, more
effectively mitigating the exposure bias problem. We demonstrate the
superiority of mixed CE over CE on several machine translation datasets, WMT&#x27;16
Ro-En, WMT&#x27;16 Ru-En, and WMT&#x27;14 En-De in both teacher forcing and scheduled
sampling setups. Furthermore, in WMT&#x27;14 En-De, we also find mixed CE
consistently outperforms CE on a multi-reference set as well as a challenging
paraphrased reference set. We also found the model trained with mixed CE is
able to provide a better probability distribution defined over the translation
output space. Our code is available at https://github.com/haorannlp/mix.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This
has motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language,
in order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential
weaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard
attention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by
constant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,
which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.
In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated
attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the
attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated
transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With
some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a
saturated transformer memory vector is $O(\log n)$, which implies saturated
transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard
to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer&#x27;s
effective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\log n)$.</span>

within the same timeframe is useful to a number of different tasks and
practitioners. A major question is how to evaluate the quality of such thematic
clusters. Here we create a corpus of microblog clusters from three different
domains and time windows and define the task of evaluating thematic coherence.
We provide annotation guidelines and human annotations of thematic coherence by
journalist experts. We subsequently investigate the efficacy of different
automated evaluation metrics for the task. We consider a range of metrics
including surface level metrics, ones for topic model coherence and text
generation metrics (TGMs). While surface level metrics perform well,
outperforming topic coherence metrics, they are not as consistent as TGMs. TGMs
are more reliable than all other metrics considered for capturing thematic
coherence in microblog clusters due to being less sensitive to the effect of
time windows.</span>

customer concerns and enhance customer order experience. Because customer
feedback often contains redundant information, a concise summary of the
feedback can be generated to help sellers better understand the issues causing
customer dissatisfaction. Previous state-of-the-art abstractive text
summarization models make two major types of factual errors when producing
summaries from customer feedback, which are wrong entity detection (WED) and
incorrect product-defect description (IPD). In this work, we introduce a set of
methods to enhance the factual consistency of abstractive summarization on
customer feedback. We augment the training data with artificially corrupted
summaries, and use them as counterparts of the target summaries. We add a
contrastive loss term into the training objective so that the model learns to
avoid certain factual errors. Evaluation results show that a large portion of
WED and IPD errors are alleviated for BART and T5. Furthermore, our approaches
do not depend on the structure of the summarization model and thus are
generalizable to any abstractive summarization systems.</span>

aims to facilitate research on grounding words to images in their contextual
usage in language. The dataset consists of images selected to unambiguously
illustrate concepts expressed in sentences from movie subtitles. The dataset is
a valuable resource as (i) the images are aligned to text fragments rather than
whole sentences; (ii) multiple images are possible for a text fragment and a
sentence; (iii) the sentences are free-form and real-world like; (iv) the
parallel texts are multilingual. We set up a fill-in-the-blank game for humans
to evaluate the quality of the automatic image selection process of our
dataset. We show the utility of the dataset on two automatic tasks: (i)
fill-in-the blank; (ii) lexical translation. Results of the human evaluation
and automatic models demonstrate that images can be a useful complement to the
textual context. The dataset will benefit research on visual grounding of words

                                        <span>To provide consistent emotional interaction with users, dialog systems should
be capable to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like
humans. However, most existing works focus on rendering specified emotions in
responses or empathetically respond to the emotion of users, yet the individual
difference in emotion expression is overlooked. This may lead to inconsistent
emotional expressions and disinterest users. To tackle this issue, we propose
to equip the dialog system with personality and enable it to automatically
select emotions in responses by simulating the emotion transition of humans in
conversation. In detail, the emotion of the dialog system is transitioned from
its preceding emotion in context. The transition is triggered by the preceding
dialog context and affected by the specified personality trait. To achieve
this, we first model the emotion transition in the dialog system as the
variation between the preceding emotion and the response emotion in the
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Then, we design neural networks
to encode the preceding dialog context and the specified personality traits to
compose the variation. Finally, the emotion for response is selected from the
sum of the preceding emotion and the variation. We construct a dialog dataset
with emotion and personality labels and conduct emotion prediction tasks for
evaluation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the
personality-affected emotion transition.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic summarization of legal case documents is an important and practical
challenge. Apart from many domain-independent text summarization algorithms
that can be used for this purpose, several algorithms have been developed
specifically for summarizing legal case documents. However, most of the
existing algorithms do not systematically incorporate domain knowledge that
specifies what information should ideally be present in a legal case document
summary. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised summarization
algorithm DELSumm which is designed to systematically incorporate guidelines
from legal experts into an optimization setup. We conduct detailed experiments
over case documents from the Indian Supreme Court. The experiments show that
our proposed unsupervised method outperforms several strong baselines in terms
of ROUGE scores, including both general summarization algorithms and
legal-specific ones. In fact, though our proposed algorithm is unsupervised, it
outperforms several supervised summarization models that are trained over
thousands of document-summary pairs.</span>

is their fragile out-of-domain generalization, which makes these models not
properly applicable to real-world general-purpose question answering problems.
In this paper, we leverage a zero-shot weighted ensemble method for improving
the robustness of out-of-domain generalization in MRC models. In the proposed
method, a weight estimation module is used to estimate out-of-domain weights,
and an ensemble module aggregate several base models&#x27; predictions based on
their weights. The experiments indicate that the proposed method not only
improves the final accuracy, but also is robust against domain changes.</span>

                                        <span>Building machine learning prediction models for a specific NLP task requires
sufficient training data, which can be difficult to obtain for low-resource
languages. Cross-lingual embeddings map word embeddings from a low-resource
language to a high-resource language so that a prediction model trained on data
from the high-resource language can also be used in the low-resource language.
To produce cross-lingual mappings of recent contextual embeddings, anchor
points between the embedding spaces have to be words in the same context. We
address this issue with a new method for creating datasets for cross-lingual
contextual alignments. Based on that, we propose novel cross-lingual mapping
methods for ELMo embeddings. Our linear mapping methods use existing vecmap and
MUSE alignments on contextual ELMo embeddings. Our new nonlinear ELMoGAN
mapping method is based on GANs and does not assume isomorphic embedding
spaces. We evaluate the proposed mapping methods on nine languages, using two
downstream tasks, NER and dependency parsing. The ELMoGAN method performs well
on the NER task, with low cross-lingual loss compared to direct training on
some languages. In the dependency parsing, linear alignment variants are more
successful.</span>

consisting of mentions and types from natural language texts. Existing
approaches, such as table filling and pairwise scoring, have shown impressive
performance on various information extraction tasks, but they are difficult to
scale to datasets with longer input texts because of their second-order
space/time complexities with respect to the input length. In this work, we
propose a Hybrid Span Generator (HySPA) that invertibly maps the information
graph to an alternating sequence of nodes and edge types, and directly
generates such sequences via a hybrid span decoder which can decode both the
spans and the types recurrently in linear time and space complexities.
Extensive experiments on the ACE05 dataset show that our approach also

                                        <span>Machine translation systems are vulnerable to domain mismatch, especially
when the task is low-resource. In this setting, out of domain translations are
often of poor quality and prone to hallucinations, due to the translation model
preferring to predict common words it has seen during training, as opposed to
the more uncommon ones from a different domain. We present two simple methods
for improving translation quality in this particular setting: First, we use
lexical shortlisting in order to restrict the neural network predictions by IBM
model computed alignments. Second, we perform $n$-best list reordering by
reranking all translations based on the amount they overlap with each other.
Our methods are computationally simpler and faster than alternative approaches,
and show a moderate success on low-resource settings with explicit out of
domain test sets. However, our methods lose their effectiveness when the domain
mismatch is too great, or in high resource setting.</span>

                                        <span>Experiments with pretrained models such as BERT are often based on a single
checkpoint. While the conclusions drawn apply to the artifact (i.e., the
particular instance of the model), it is not always clear whether they hold for
the more general procedure (which includes the model architecture, training
data, initialization scheme, and loss function). Recent work has shown that
re-running pretraining can lead to substantially different conclusions about
performance, suggesting that alternative evaluations are needed to make
principled statements about procedures. To address this question, we introduce
MultiBERTs: a set of 25 BERT-base checkpoints, trained with similar
hyper-parameters as the original BERT model but differing in random
initialization and data shuffling. The aim is to enable researchers to draw
robust and statistically justified conclusions about pretraining procedures.
The full release includes 25 fully trained checkpoints, as well as statistical
guidelines and a code library implementing our recommended hypothesis testing
methods. Finally, for five of these models we release a set of 28 intermediate
checkpoints in order to support research on learning dynamics.</span>

consists of a streaming recurrent neural network transducer (RNNT) based

SLU model paradigm can leverage state-of-the-art advancements and pretrained

completely alleviated the need for labeled data, which is cumbersome to collect
for all target languages. Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is emerging as a
practical solution: pre-trained models later fine-tuned on one transfer
language exhibit surprising performance when tested on many target languages.
English is the dominant source language for transfer, as reinforced by popular
zero-shot benchmarks. However, this default choice has not been systematically
vetted. In our study, we compare English against other transfer languages for
fine-tuning, on two pre-trained multilingual models (mBERT and mT5) and
multiple classification and question answering tasks. We find that other
high-resource languages such as German and Russian often transfer more
effectively, especially when the set of target languages is diverse or unknown
a priori. Unexpectedly, this can be true even when the training sets were
automatically translated from English. This finding can have immediate impact
on multilingual zero-shot systems, and should inform future benchmark designs.</span>

                                        <span>To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing
number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled
source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods
assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which
ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple
source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster
R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which
can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power.
Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo
target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to
conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features,
respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second,
we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal
parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in
different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region
proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract
invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>High resolution images are widely used in our daily life, whereas high-speed
video capture is challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at
the high resolution mode. Digging deeper, the main bottleneck lies in the low
throughput of existing imaging systems. Towards this end, snapshot compressive
imaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of
imaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction.
During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a
single measurement. After this, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video
frames from the coded snapshot. Recently developed Plug-and-Play (PnP)
algorithms make it possible for SCI reconstruction in large-scale problems.
However, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI&#x27;s
wide application. In this paper, we build a novel hybrid coded aperture
snapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid
crystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement
a PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high quality
reconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we achieve
a 10-mega pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high
throughput of 4.6G voxels per second. Both simulation and real data experiments
verify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.</span>

different uncertainties. However, it has been an active field of research for
many years. Nevertheless, efficiency and performance are yet essential aspects
for building robust systems. We proposed two models, EmoXNet which is an
ensemble learning technique for learning convoluted facial representations, and
EmoXNetLite which is a distillation technique that is useful for transferring
the knowledge from our ensemble model to an efficient deep neural network using
label-smoothen soft labels for able to effectively detect expressions in
real-time. Both of the techniques performed quite well, where the ensemble
model (EmoXNet) helped to achieve 85.07% test accuracy on FER2013 with FER+

contrastive learning on image classification tasks, we propose a new
self-supervised method for the structured regression task of 3D hand pose
estimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled data for the purpose of
representation learning via a loss formulation that encourages the learned
feature representations to be invariant under any image transformation. For 3D
hand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have invariance to appearance
transformation such as color jitter. However, the task requires equivariance
under affine transformations, such as rotation and translation. To address this
issue, we propose an equivariant contrastive objective and demonstrate its
effectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose estimation. We experimentally
investigate the impact of invariant and equivariant contrastive objectives and
show that learning equivariant features leads to better representations for the
task of 3D hand pose estimation. Furthermore, we show that a standard
ResNet-152, trained on additional unlabeled data, attains an improvement of
$7.6\%$ in PA-EPE on FreiHAND and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance
without any task specific, specialized architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised contrastive learning has demonstrated great potential in
learning visual representations. Despite their success on various downstream
tasks such as image classification and object detection, self-supervised
pre-training for fine-grained scenarios is not fully explored. In this paper,
we first point out that current contrastive methods are prone to memorizing
background/foreground texture and therefore have a limitation in localizing the
foreground object. Analysis suggests that learning to extract discriminative
texture information and localization are equally crucial for self-supervised
pre-training under fine-grained scenarios. Based on our findings, we introduce
Cross-view Saliency Alignment (CVSA), a contrastive learning framework that
first crops and swaps saliency regions of images as a novel view generation and
then guides the model to localize on the foreground object via a cross-view
alignment loss. Extensive experiments on four popular fine-grained
classification benchmarks show that CVSA significantly improves the learned
representation.</span>

rely on text annotation, such as human generated captions or machine generated
automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the
Audio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a
shared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To
circumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations
from randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train
AVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,
and evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet&#x27;s learned
representations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn
audio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly
processes raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a
multi-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval. Our code,

                                        <span>Fetal motion is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional MR scan
times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and
dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with
compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal
MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices
for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording
the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes
it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods.
To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal
Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised
super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice
acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition
along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate
pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution
network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time
series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data.
Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method
outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image
quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.</span>

                                        <span>Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine
learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve
the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning
rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective
adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer
problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic
momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. At the
same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by
using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in
estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated
BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still
achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ without large
batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm
(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our
methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of
adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum
and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence
analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel
optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel
optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.</span>

                                        <span>Hash coding has been widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for
large-scale image retrieval. Given semantic annotations such as class labels
and pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and
generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images
may contain undefined semantic labels, which we call unseen images, zeor-shot
hashing techniques have been studied. However, existing zeor-shot hashing
methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle
multi-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive
zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In
order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge
is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then,
pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for
training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data.
Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that,
the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the
competing methods.</span>

therapeutic efficacy of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite tremendous efforts
made within the research community, single-camera video recordings are mainly
used for such analysis. Because of the potential to create rich descriptions of
mouse social behaviors, the use of multi-view video recordings for rodent
observations is increasingly receiving much attention. However, identifying
social behaviours from various views is still challenging due to the lack of
correspondence across data sources. To address this problem, we here propose a
novel multiview latent-attention and dynamic discriminative model that jointly
learns view-specific and view-shared sub-structures, where the former captures
unique dynamics of each view whilst the latter encodes the interaction between
the views. Furthermore, a novel multi-view latent-attention variational
autoencoder model is introduced in learning the acquired features, enabling us
to learn discriminative features in each view. Experimental results on the
standard CRMI13 and our multi-view Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB)
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the other state of the arts
technologies and effectively deals with the imbalanced data problem.</span>

                                        <span>The increasing availability of large-scale remote sensing labeled data has
prompted researchers to develop increasingly precise and accurate data-driven
models for land cover and crop classification (LC&amp;CC). Moreover, with the
introduction of self-attention and introspection mechanisms, deep learning
approaches have shown promising results in processing long temporal sequences
in the multi-spectral domain with a contained computational request.
Nevertheless, most practical applications cannot rely on labeled data, and in
the field, surveys are a time consuming solution that poses strict limitations
to the number of collected samples. Moreover, atmospheric conditions and
specific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap
that does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available
dataset to the area of interest. In this paper, we investigate adversarial
training of deep neural networks to bridge the domain discrepancy between
distinct geographical zones. In particular, we perform a thorough analysis of
domain adaptation applied to challenging multi-spectral, multi-temporal data,
accurately highlighting the advantages of adapting state-of-the-art
self-attention based models for LC&amp;CC to different target zones where labeled
data are not available. Extensive experimentation demonstrated significant
performance and generalization gain in applying domain-adversarial training to
source and target regions with marked dissimilarities between the distribution
of extracted features.</span>

(WCE) is thwarted by the lack of data. The inadequacy in richly representative
healthy and abnormal conditions results in isolated analyses of pathologies,
that can not handle realistic multi-pathology scenarios. In this work, we
explore how to learn more for free, from limited data through solving a WCE
multicentric, multi-pathology classification problem. Learning more implies to
learning more than full supervision would allow with the same data. This is
done by combining self supervision with full supervision, under multi task
learning. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the Human Visual System (HVS)
in designing self supervision tasks and investigate if seemingly ineffectual
signals within the data itself can be exploited to gain performance, if so,
which signals would be better than others. Further, we present our analysis of
the high level features as a stepping stone towards more robust multi-pathology
CADx in WCE.</span>

(a query which combines visual input with additional semantic information in
natural language feedback). We propose a SynthTriplet GAN framework which
resolves this task by expanding the multimodal query with a synthetically
generated image that captures semantic information from both image and text
input. We introduce a novel triplet mining method that uses a synthetic image
as an anchor to directly optimize for embedding distances of generated and
target images. We demonstrate that apart from the added value of retrieval
illustration with synthetic image with the focus on customization and user
feedback, the proposed method greatly surpasses other multimodal generation
methods and achieves state of the art results in the multimodal retrieval task.
We also show that in contrast to other retrieval methods, our method provides
explainable embeddings.</span>

                                        <span>Monocular 3D object detection is an important task in autonomous driving. It
can be easily intractable where there exists ego-car pose change w.r.t. ground
plane. This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and
slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods
on open datasets neglect the camera pose information, which inevitably results
in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The
perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for
industrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera
pose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically,
the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting
vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify
perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works
independent of the extrinsic parameter variations and produces accurate results
in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing
monocular detectors fail to handle. Experiments demonstrate our method yields
the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large
margin on both KITTI 3D and nuScenes datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (multi-source UDA) aims to learn
a model from several labeled source domains while performing well on a
different target domain where only unlabeled data are available at training
time. To align source and target features distributions, several recent works
use source and target explicit statistics matching such as features moments or
class centroids. Yet, these approaches do not guarantee class conditional
distributions alignment across domains. In this work, we propose a new
framework called Contrastive Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (CMSDA) for
multi-source UDA that addresses this limitation. Discriminative features are
learned from interpolated source examples via cross entropy minimization and
from target examples via consistency regularization and hard pseudo-labeling.
Simultaneously, interpolated source examples are leveraged to align source
class conditional distributions through an interpolated version of the
supervised contrastive loss. This alignment leads to more general and
transferable features which further improve the generalization on the target
domain. Extensive experiments have been carried out on three standard
multi-source UDA datasets where our method reports state-of-the-art results.</span>

                                        <span>Face anti-spoofing approaches based on domain generalization (DG) have drawn
growing attention due to their robustness for unseen scenarios. Previous
methods treat each sample from multiple domains indiscriminately during the
training process, and endeavor to extract a common feature space to improve the
generalization. However, due to complex and biased data distribution, directly
treating them equally will corrupt the generalization ability. To settle the
issue, we propose a novel Dual Reweighting Domain Generalization (DRDG)
framework which iteratively reweights the relative importance between samples
to further improve the generalization. Concretely, Sample Reweighting Module is
first proposed to identify samples with relatively large domain bias, and
reduce their impact on the overall optimization. Afterwards, Feature
Reweighting Module is introduced to focus on these samples and extract more
domain-irrelevant features via a self-distilling mechanism. Combined with the
domain discriminator, the iteration of the two modules promotes the extraction
of generalized features. Extensive experiments and visualizations are presented
to demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method against the
state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

                                        <span>Robust and accurate nuclei centroid detection is important for the
understanding of biological structures in fluorescence microscopy images.
Existing automated nuclei localization methods face three main challenges: (1)
Most of object detection methods work only on 2D images and are difficult to
extend to 3D volumes; (2) Segmentation-based models can be used on 3D volumes
but it is computational expensive for large microscopy volumes and they have
difficulty distinguishing different instances of objects; (3) Hand annotated
ground truth is limited for 3D microscopy volumes. To address these issues, we
present a scalable approach for nuclei centroid detection of 3D microscopy
volumes. We describe the RCNN-SliceNet to detect 2D nuclei centroids for each
slice of the volume from different directions and 3D agglomerative hierarchical
clustering (AHC) is used to estimate the 3D centroids of nuclei in a volume.
The model was trained with the synthetic microscopy data generated using
Spatially Constrained Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (SpCycleGAN) and
tested on different types of real 3D microscopy data. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately count and detect
the nuclei centroids in a 3D microscopy volume.</span>

                                        <span>Lie detection is considered a concern for everyone in their day to day life
given its impact on human interactions. Thus, people normally pay attention to
both what their interlocutors are saying and also to their visual appearances,
including faces, to try to find any signs that indicate whether the person is
telling the truth or not. While automatic lie detection may help us to
understand this lying characteristics, current systems are still fairly
limited, partly due to lack of adequate datasets to evaluate their performance
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we have collected an annotated dataset of
facial images, comprising both 2D and 3D information of several participants
during a card game that encourages players to lie. Using our collected dataset,
We evaluated several types of machine learning-based lie detectors in terms of
their generalization, person-specific and cross-domain experiments. Our results
show that models based on deep learning achieve the best accuracy, reaching up
to 57\% for the generalization task and 63\% when dealing with a single
participant. Finally, we also highlight the limitation of the deep learning
based lie detector when dealing with cross-domain lie detection tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Robot manipulation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a
challenging problem due to the variety of shapes, materials, arrangements and
lighting conditions. Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust
perception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across
various lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we
propose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.
The underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural
network using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation
masks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as
output. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo
sub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection,
unknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and
significantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor.
By inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can
be used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and
hard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments.
In unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D
network and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects.
However, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent)
objects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust
manipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer models have achieved great progress on computer vision tasks
recently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by
their high representation ability for extracting informative features from
input images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep
architectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the
depth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between
shortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present
an augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable
parameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational
costs, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant
projection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
brings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers
without obviously increasing their parameters and FLOPs.</span>

                                        <span>Long-range context information is crucial for the semantic segmentation of
High-Resolution (HR) Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). The image cropping
operations, commonly used for training neural networks, limit the perception of
long-range context information in large RSIs. To break this limitation, we
propose a Wider-Context Network (WiCNet) for the semantic segmentation of HR
RSIs. In the WiCNet, apart from a conventional feature extraction network to
aggregate the local information, an extra context branch is designed to
explicitly model the context information in a larger image area. The
information between the two branches is communicated through a Context
Transformer, which is a novel design derived from the Vision Transformer to
model the long-range context correlations. Ablation studies and comparative
experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Additionally, we present a new Beijing Land-Use (BLU)
dataset. This is a large-scale HR satellite dataset provided with high-quality

gained popularity in the computer vision community, and thus various approaches
have been proposed. Among these approaches, the method using I3D network
achieves the highest recognition accuracy on large public datasets for WSLR.
However, the method with I3D only utilizes appearance information of the upper
body of the signers to recognize sign language words. On the other hand, in
WSLR, the information of local regions, such as the hand shape and facial
expression, and the positional relationship among the body and both hands are
important. Thus in this work, we utilized local region images of both hands and
face, along with skeletal information to capture local information and the
positions of both hands relative to the body, respectively. In other words, we
propose a novel multi-stream WSLR framework, in which a stream with local
region images and a stream with skeletal information are introduced by
extending I3D network to improve the recognition accuracy of WSLR. From the
experimental results on WLASL dataset, it is evident that the proposed method
has achieved about 15% improvement in the Top-1 accuracy than the existing
conventional methods.</span>

competitive results for visual tasks, but fail to consider high-level local
pattern information in input images. In this paper, we present a generic
Dual-stream Network (DS-Net) to fully explore the representation capacity of
local and global pattern features for image classification. Our DS-Net can
simultaneously calculate fine-grained and integrated features and efficiently
fuse them. Specifically, we propose an Intra-scale Propagation module to
process two different resolutions in each block and an Inter-Scale Alignment
module to perform information interaction across features at dual scales.
Besides, we also design a Dual-stream FPN (DS-FPN) to further enhance
contextual information for downstream dense predictions. Without bells and
whistles, the propsed DS-Net outperforms Deit-Small by 2.4% in terms of top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1k and achieves state-of-the-art performance over other

                                        <span>Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to
predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source
task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been
widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major
challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the
cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this
problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of
transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.
In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score
that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in
OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the
joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal
transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and
label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative
conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,
respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability
metrics on average.</span>

                                        <span>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can decrease the amount of required labeled
image data and thus the cost for deep learning. Most SSL methods only consider
a clear distinction between classes but in many real-world datasets, this clear
distinction is not given due to intra- or interobserver variability. This
variability can lead to different annotations per image. Thus many images have
ambiguous annotations and their label needs to be considered &quot;fuzzy&quot;. This
fuzziness of labels must be addressed as it will limit the performance of
Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and deep learning in general. We propose
Semi-Supervised Classification &amp; Clustering (S2C2) which can extend many deep
SSL algorithms. S2C2 can estimate the fuzziness of a label and applies SSL as a
classification to certainly labeled data while creating distinct clusters for
images with similar but fuzzy labels. We show that S2C2 results in median 7.4%
better F1-score for classifications and 5.4% lower inner distance of clusters
across multiple SSL algorithms and datasets while being more interpretable due
to the fuzziness estimation of our method. Overall, a combination of
Semi-Supervised Learning with our method S2C2 leads to better handling of the
fuzziness of labels and thus real-world datasets.</span>

within a Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) solution using a brightfield microscope.
However, this method takes a long time, is based on the experience of the
clinician, and has a low accuracy. With the increase of neural network
applications in the field of clinical microscopy it is now possible to automate
such manual processes increasing both efficiency and accuracy. This study
presents a deep neural network structure that enables the rapid solutions for
these problems and can perform automatic fungi detection in grayscale images
without colorants. Microscopic images of 81 fungi and 235 ceratine were
collected. Then, smaller patches were extracted containing 2062 fungi and 2142
ceratine. In order to detect fungus and ceratine, two models were created one
of which was a custom neural network and the other was based on the VGG16
architecture. The developed custom model had 99.84% accuracy, and an area under
the curve (AUC) value of 1.00, while the VGG16 model had 98.89% accuracy and an
AUC value of 0.99. However, average accuracy and AUC value of clinicians is
72.8% and 0.87 respectively. This deep learning model allows the development of
an automated system that can detect fungi within microscopic images.</span>

                                        <span>Temporal language grounding (TLG) is a fundamental and challenging problem
for vision and language understanding. Existing methods mainly focus on fully
supervised setting with temporal boundary labels for training, which, however,
suffers expensive cost of annotation. In this work, we are dedicated to weakly
supervised TLG, where multiple description sentences are given to an untrimmed
video without temporal boundary labels. In this task, it is critical to learn a
strong cross-modal semantic alignment between sentence semantics and visual
content. To this end, we introduce a novel weakly supervised temporal adjacent
network (WSTAN) for temporal language grounding. Specifically, WSTAN learns
cross-modal semantic alignment by exploiting temporal adjacent network in a
multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm, with a whole description paragraph
as input. Moreover, we integrate a complementary branch into the framework,
which explicitly refines the predictions with pseudo supervision from the MIL
stage. An additional self-discriminating loss is devised on both the MIL branch
and the complementary branch, aiming to enhance semantic discrimination by
self-supervising. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used
benchmark datasets, \emph{i.e.}, ActivityNet-Captions, Charades-STA, and
DiDeMo, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</span>

classes are generated daily, which raise an urgent demand for video
classification methods that can continuously update new classes while
maintaining the knowledge of old videos with limited storage and computing
resources. In this paper, we summarize this task as \textit{Class-Incremental
Video Classification (CIVC)} and propose a novel framework to address it. As a
subarea of incremental learning tasks, the challenge of \textit{catastrophic
forgetting} is unavoidable in CIVC. To better alleviate it, we utilize some
characteristics of videos. First, we decompose the spatio-temporal knowledge
before distillation rather than treating it as a whole in the knowledge
transfer process; trajectory is also used to refine the decomposition. Second,
we propose a dual granularity exemplar selection method to select and store
representative video instances of old classes and key-frames inside videos
under a tight storage budget. We benchmark our method and previous SOTA
class-incremental learning methods on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics

estimates and dense depth maps of the immediate surroundings. Leveraging the
proposed lightweight Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for depth
inference and encoding, we provide the network with previously marginalized
sparse features from VIO to increase the accuracy of initial depth prediction

First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation. As opposed to previous
works relying on completely dense residuals, we propose to only provide sparse
measurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation
that our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve
the estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose

                                        <span>Resolution in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is typically bounded
by the receptive field size through filter sizes, and subsampling layers or
strided convolutions on feature maps. The optimal resolution may vary
significantly depending on the dataset. Modern CNNs hard-code their resolution
hyper-parameters in the network architecture which makes tuning such
hyper-parameters cumbersome. We propose to do away with hard-coded resolution
hyper-parameters and aim to learn the appropriate resolution from data. We use
scale-space theory to obtain a self-similar parametrization of filters and make
use of the N-Jet: a truncated Taylor series to approximate a filter by a
learned combination of Gaussian derivative filters. The parameter sigma of the
Gaussian basis controls both the amount of detail the filter encodes and the
spatial extent of the filter. Since sigma is a continuous parameter, we can
optimize it with respect to the loss. The proposed N-Jet layer achieves
comparable performance when used in state-of-the art architectures, while
learning the correct resolution in each layer automatically. We evaluate our
N-Jet layer on both classification and segmentation, and we show that learning
sigma is especially beneficial for inputs at multiple sizes.</span>

                                        <span>Real-time video deblurring still remains a challenging task due to the
complexity of spatially and temporally varying blur itself and the requirement
of low computational cost. To improve the network efficiency, we adopt residual
dense blocks into RNN cells, so as to efficiently extract the spatial features
of the current frame. Furthermore, a global spatio-temporal attention module is
proposed to fuse the effective hierarchical features from past and future
frames to help better deblur the current frame. Another issue needs to be
addressed urgently is the lack of a real-world benchmark dataset. Thus, we
contribute a novel dataset (BSD) to the community, by collecting paired
blurry/sharp video clips using a co-axis beam splitter acquisition system.
Experimental results show that the proposed method (ESTRNN) can achieve better
deblurring performance both quantitatively and qualitatively with less
computational cost against state-of-the-art video deblurring methods. In
addition, cross-validation experiments between datasets illustrate the high
generality of BSD over the synthetic datasets. The code and dataset are
released at https://github.com/zzh-tech/ESTRNN.</span>

                                        <span>Many man-made objects are characterised by a shape that is symmetric along
one or more planar directions. Estimating the location and orientation of such
symmetry planes can aid many tasks such as estimating the overall orientation
of an object of interest or performing shape completion, where a partial scan
of an object is reflected across the estimated symmetry plane in order to
obtain a more detailed shape. Many methods processing 3D data rely on expensive
3D convolutions. In this paper we present an alternative novel encoding that
instead slices the data along the height dimension and passes it sequentially
to a 2D convolutional recurrent regression scheme. The method also comprises a
differentiable least squares step, allowing for end-to-end accurate and fast
processing of both full and partial scans of symmetric objects. We use this
approach to efficiently handle 3D inputs to design a method to estimate planar
reflective symmetries. We show that our approach has an accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art techniques on the task of planar reflective symmetry
estimation on full synthetic objects. Additionally, we show that it can be
deployed on partial scans of objects in a real-world pipeline to improve the
outputs of a 3D object detector.</span>

graphs. We generalize a previously known distance measure on graphs (Graph
Diffusion Distance), thereby allowing it to be tuned to minimize an arbitrary
loss function. Because all steps involved in calculating this modified GDD are
differentiable, we demonstrate that it is possible for a small neural network
model to learn edge weights which minimize loss. GDD alone does not effectively
discriminate between graphs constructed from shoot apical meristem images of
wild-type vs. mutant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} specimens. However, training
edge weights and kernel parameters with contrastive loss produces a learned
distance metric with large margins between these graph categories. We
demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple
k-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also
demonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis:
once trained, we use our model to compute the distance between the biological
graphs and a set of graphs output by a cell division simulator. This allows us
to identify simulation parameter regimes which are similar to each class of
graph in our original dataset.</span>

video-data from a wide-angle stereo camera system mounted at an urban
intersection into the forecast of cyclist trajectories. We extract features
from image and optical flow (OF) sequences using 3D convolutional neural
networks (3D-ConvNet) and combine them with features extracted from the
cyclist&#x27;s past trajectory to forecast future cyclist positions. By the use of
additional information, we are able to improve positional accuracy by about 7.5
% for our test dataset and by up to 22 % for specific motion types compared to
a method solely based on past trajectories. Furthermore, we compare the use of
image sequences to the use of OF sequences as additional information, showing
that OF alone leads to significant improvements in positional accuracy. By
training and testing our methods using a real-world dataset recorded at a
heavily frequented public intersection and evaluating the methods&#x27; runtimes, we

our view, solving this problem requires learning of contextual semantic priors,
a challenging endeavour given the spatial and semantic variability of indoor
environments. Current methods learn to implicitly encode these priors through
goal-oriented navigation policy functions operating on spatial representations
that are limited to the agent&#x27;s observable areas. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that actively learns to generate semantic maps outside the
field of view of the agent and leverages the uncertainty over the semantic
classes in the unobserved areas to decide on long term goals. We demonstrate
that through this spatial prediction strategy, we are able to learn semantic
priors in scenes that can be leveraged in unknown environments. Additionally,
we show how different objectives can be defined by balancing exploration with
exploitation during searching for semantic targets. Our method is validated in
the visually realistic environments offered by the Matterport3D dataset and
show state of the art results on the object goal navigation task.</span>

machine learning problems. Although multiple adaptive methods were recently
studied, they mainly focus on either empirical or theoretical aspects and also
only work for specific problems by using specific adaptive learning rates. It
is desired to design a universal framework for practical algorithms of adaptive
gradients with theoretical guarantee to solve general problems. To fill this
gap, we propose a faster and universal framework of adaptive gradients (i.e.,
SUPER-ADAM) by introducing a universal adaptive matrix that includes most
existing adaptive gradient forms. Moreover, our framework can flexibly
integrates the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, our
novel framework provides the convergence analysis support for adaptive gradient
methods under the nonconvex setting. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our
new algorithm can achieve the best known complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of
nonconvex optimization, which matches the lower bound for stochastic smooth
nonconvex optimization. In numerical experiments, we employ various deep
learning tasks to validate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
existing adaptive algorithms.</span>

fine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class
variances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by
locating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the
complete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its
strong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image
classification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without
requiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention
mechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the
model&#x27;s capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting
with four popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars,
Stanford Dogs, and FGVC7 Plant Pathology. We also prove our model&#x27;s

its verification performance across demographic groups and the composition of
the used gallery. Further, we report results for identification experiments on
differently composed demographic subsets, i.e. females and males, of the public
academic MORPH database using the open-source ArcFace face recognition system.
It is shown that the database composition has a huge impact on performance
differentials in biometric identification systems, even if performance
differentials are less pronounced in the verification scenario. This study
represents the first detailed analysis of the watchlist imbalance effect which
is expected to be of high interest for future research in the field of facial
recognition.</span>

                                        <span>Image classification methods are usually trained to perform predictions
taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identify
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple
and plug-and-play open set recognition modules that can be attached to
pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for
failure recognition in object recognition tasks. We conduct a thorough
evaluation of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art open set
algorithms, finding that GeMOS either outperforms or is statistically
indistinguishable from more complex and costly models.</span>

Hessian for a Riemannian manifold that is a quotient of a manifold embedded in
an inner product space with a non-constant metric function. Together with a
classical formula for projection, this allows us to evaluate Riemannian
gradient and Hessian for several families of metrics on classical manifolds,
including a family of metrics on Stiefel manifolds connecting both the constant
and canonical ambient metrics with closed-form geodesics. Using these formulas,
we derive Riemannian optimization frameworks on quotients of Stiefel manifolds,
including flag manifolds, and a new family of complete quotient metrics on the
manifold of positive-semidefinite matrices of fixed rank, considered as a
quotient of a product of Stiefel and positive-definite matrix manifold with
affine-invariant metrics. The method is procedural, and in many instances, the
Riemannian gradient and Hessian formulas could be derived by symbolic calculus.
The method extends the list of potential metrics that could be used in manifold
optimization and machine learning.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer attention architectures, similar to those developed for natural
language processing, have recently proved efficient also in vision, either in
conjunction with or as a replacement for convolutional layers. Typically,
visual attention is inserted in the network architecture as a (series of)
feedforward self-attention module(s), with mutual key-query agreement as the
main selection and routing operation. However efficient, this strategy is only
vaguely compatible with the way that attention is implemented in biological
brains: as a separate and unified network of attentional selection regions,
receiving inputs from and exerting modulatory influence on the entire hierarchy
of visual regions. Here, we report experiments with a simple such attention
system that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks,
with relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer
of the network produces a key-query vector pair; all queries are then pooled
into a global attention query. On the next iteration, the match between each
key and the global attention query modulates the network&#x27;s activations --
emphasizing or silencing the locations that agree or disagree (respectively)
with the global attention system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this
brain-inspired Global Attention Agreement network (GAttANet) for various
convolutional backbones (from a simple 5-layer toy model to a standard ResNet50
architecture) and datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Imagenet-1k). Each time, our
global attention system improves accuracy over the corresponding baseline.</span>

for food recognition. Dietary studies showed that dietary-related problem such
as obesity is associated with other chronic diseases like hypertension,
irregular blood sugar levels, and increased risk of heart attacks. The primary
cause of these problems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits,
which are manageable by using interactive mHealth apps that use automatic
visual-based methods to assess dietary intake. This review discusses the most
performing methodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food
recognition. First, we will present the rationale of visual-based methods for
food recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation, discussion and
evaluation of these methods on popular food image databases. We also discussed
the mobile applications that are implementing these methods. The review ends

noisy output using a U-Net model trained on denoising at various noise levels.
SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different
magnification factors, on faces and natural images. We conduct human evaluation
on a standard 8X face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ, comparing with SOTA
GAN methods. SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic
outputs, while GANs do not exceed a fool rate of 34%. We further show the

pursue better compression efficiency beyond the latest Versatile Video Coding
(VVC), where we encode intra frames at original high resolution (HR), compress
inter frames at a lower resolution (LR), and then super-resolve decoded LR
inter frames with the help from preceding HR intra and neighboring LR inter
frames. For a LR inter frame, a motion alignment and aggregation network (MAN)
is devised to produce temporally aggregated motion representation (AMR) for the
guarantee of temporal smoothness; Another texture compensation network (TCN)
inputs decoded HR intra frame, re-sampled HR intra frame, and this LR inter
frame to generate multiscale affinity map (MAM) and multiscale texture

similarity-driven fusion synthesizes AMR, MTR, MAM to upscale LR inter frame
for the removal of compression and resolution re-sampling noises. We enhance
the VVC using proposed CRS, showing averaged 8.76% and 11.93% Bj{\o}ntegaard

                                        <span>In applications such as object tracking, time-series data inevitably carry
missing observations. Following the success of deep learning-based models for
various sequence learning tasks, these models increasingly replace classic
approaches in object tracking applications for inferring the object motions
state. While traditional tracking approaches can deal with missing
observations, most of their deep counterparts are, by default, not suited for
this.

Towards this end, this paper introduces a transformer-based approach for
handling missing observations in variable input length trajectory data. The
model is formed indirectly by successively increasing the complexity of the
demanded inference tasks. Starting from reproducing noise-free trajectories,
the model then learns to infer trajectories from noisy inputs. By providing
missing tokens, binary-encoded missing events, the model learns to in-attend to
missing data and infers a complete trajectory conditioned on the remaining
inputs. In the case of a sequence of successive missing events, the model then
acts as a pure prediction model. The model&#x27;s abilities are demonstrated on
synthetic data and real-world data reflecting prototypical object tracking
scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural network (CNN) have proven its success for semantic
segmentation, which is a core task of emerging industrial applications such as
autonomous driving. However, most progress in semantic segmentation of urban
scenes is reported on standard scenarios, i.e., daytime scenes with favorable
illumination conditions. In practical applications, the outdoor weather and
illumination are changeable, e.g., cloudy and nighttime, which results in a
significant drop of semantic segmentation accuracy of CNN only trained with
daytime data. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network
(namely Mutual-GAN) to alleviate the accuracy decline when daytime-trained
neural network is applied to videos captured under adverse weather conditions.
The proposed Mutual-GAN adopts mutual information constraint to preserve
image-objects during cross-weather adaptation, which is an unsolved problem for
most unsupervised image-to-image translation approaches (e.g., CycleGAN). The
proposed Mutual-GAN is evaluated on two publicly available driving video
datasets (i.e., CamVid and SYNTHIA). The experimental results demonstrate that
our Mutual-GAN can yield visually plausible translated images and significantly
improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of daytime-trained deep learning
network while processing videos under challenging weathers.</span>

                                        <span>Whole-slide-image cartography is the process of automatically detecting and
outlining different tissue types in digitized histological specimen. This
semantic segmentation provides a basis for many follow-up analyses and can
potentially guide subsequent medical decisions. Due to their large size,
whole-slide-images typically have to be divided into smaller patches which are
then analyzed individually using machine learning-based approaches. Thereby,
local dependencies of image regions get lost and since a whole-slide-image
comprises many thousands of such patches this process is inherently slow. We
propose to subdivide the image into coherent regions prior to classification by
grouping visually similar adjacent image pixels into larger segments, i.e.
superpixels. Afterwards, only a random subset of patches per superpixel is
classified and patch labels are combined into a single superpixel label. The
algorithm has been developed and validated on a dataset of 159 hand-annotated
whole-slide-images of colon resections and its performance has been compared to
a standard patch-based approach. The algorithm shows an average speed-up of 41%
on the test data and the overall accuracy is increased from 93.8% to 95.7%. We
additionally propose a metric for identifying superpixels with an uncertain
classification so they can be excluded from further analysis. Finally, we
evaluate two potential medical applications, namely tumor area estimation
including tumor invasive margin generation and tumor composition analysis.</span>

                                        <span>ML-enabled software systems have been incorporated in many public
demonstrations for automated driving (AD) systems. Such solutions have also
been considered as a crucial approach to aim at SAE Level 5 systems, where the
passengers in such vehicles do not have to interact with the system at all
anymore. Already in 2016, Nvidia demonstrated a complete end-to-end approach
for training the complete software stack covering perception, planning and
decision making, and the actual vehicle control. While such approaches show the
great potential of such ML-enabled systems, there have also been demonstrations
where already changes to single pixels in a video frame can potentially lead to
completely different decisions with dangerous consequences. In this paper, a
structured analysis has been conducted to explore video degradation effects on
the performance of an ML-enabled pedestrian detector. Firstly, a baseline of
applying YOLO to 1,026 frames with pedestrian annotations in the KITTI Vision
Benchmark Suite has been established. Next, video degradation candidates for
each of these frames were generated using the leading video codecs libx264,
libx265, Nvidia HEVC, and AV1: 52 frames for the various compression presets
for color and gray-scale frames resulting in 104 degradation candidates per
original KITTI frame and 426,816 images in total. YOLO was applied to each
image to compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric to compare the
performance with the original baseline. While aggressively lossy compression
settings result in significant performance drops as expected, it was also
observed that some configurations actually result in slightly better IoU
results compared to the baseline. The findings show that carefully chosen lossy
video configurations preserve a decent performance of particular ML-enabled
systems while allowing for substantial savings when storing or transmitting
data.</span>

capability that robots need when functioning in unstructured environments.
While previous methods have exhibited promising results, they still tend to
provide incorrect results in highly cluttered scenes. We postulate that a
network architecture that encodes relations between objects at a high-level can
be beneficial. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel framework that refines
the output of such methods by utilizing a graph-based representation of
instance masks. We train deep networks capable of sampling smart perturbations
to the segmentations, and a graph neural network, which can encode relations
between objects, to evaluate the perturbed segmentations. Our proposed method
is orthogonal to previous works and achieves state-of-the-art performance when
combined with them. We demonstrate an application that uses uncertainty
estimates generated by our method to guide a manipulator, leading to efficient
understanding of cluttered scenes. Code, models, and video can be found at

with normal (i.e., healthy) images to detect any abnormal (i.e., unhealthy)
samples that do not conform to the expected normal patterns. UAD has two main
advantages over its fully supervised counterpart. Firstly, it is able to
directly leverage large datasets available from health screening programs that
contain mostly normal image samples, avoiding the costly manual labelling of
abnormal samples and the subsequent issues involved in training with extremely
class-imbalanced data. Further, UAD approaches can potentially detect and
localise any type of lesions that deviate from the normal patterns. One
significant challenge faced by UAD methods is how to learn effective
low-dimensional image representations to detect and localise subtle
abnormalities, generally consisting of small lesions. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised representation learning method,
called Constrained Contrastive Distribution learning for anomaly detection
(CCD), which learns fine-grained feature representations by simultaneously
predicting the distribution of augmented data and image contexts using
contrastive learning with pretext constraints. The learned representations can
be leveraged to train more anomaly-sensitive detection models. Extensive
experiment results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
UAD approaches on three different colonoscopy and fundus screening datasets.

annotations to learn feature representations. For vision tasks, pretext tasks
such as predicting rotation, solving jigsaw are solely created from the input
data. Yet, predicting this known information helps in learning representations
useful for downstream tasks. However, recent works have shown that wider and
deeper models benefit more from self-supervised learning than smaller models.
To address the issue of self-supervised pre-training of smaller models, we
propose Distill-on-the-Go (DoGo), a self-supervised learning paradigm using
single-stage online knowledge distillation to improve the representation
quality of the smaller models. We employ deep mutual learning strategy in which
two models collaboratively learn from each other to improve one another.
Specifically, each model is trained using self-supervised learning along with
distillation that aligns each model&#x27;s softmax probabilities of similarity
scores with that of the peer model. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets, learning objectives, and architectures to
demonstrate the potential of our proposed method. Our results show significant
performance gain in the presence of noisy and limited labels and generalization

                                        <span>Neural networks are susceptible to small transformations including 2D
rotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. This is
often attributed to biases in the training dataset, and the lack of 2D
shift-invariance due to not respecting the sampling theorem. In this paper, we
challenge this hypothesis by training and testing on unbiased datasets, and
showing that networks are brittle to both small 3D perspective changes and
lighting variations which cannot be explained by dataset bias or lack of
shift-invariance. To find these in-distribution errors, we introduce an
evolution strategies (ES) based approach, which we call CMA-Search. Despite
training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera
and light variations, in over 71% cases CMA-Search can find camera parameters
in the vicinity of a correctly classified image which lead to in-distribution
misclassifications with &lt; 3.6% change in parameters. With lighting changes,
CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 33% cases with &lt; 11.6% change in
parameters. Finally, we extend this method to find misclassifications in the
vicinity of ImageNet images for both ResNet and OpenAI&#x27;s CLIP model.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and
their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are &quot;data hungry&quot; and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our model eliminates the requirement
for class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling
strategy and the use of convolutions. We show that compared to CNNs, our
compact transformers have fewer parameters and MACs, while obtaining similar
accuracies. Our method is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as
little as 0.28M parameters and achieve reasonable results. It can reach an
accuracy of 95.29 % when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is comparable
with modern CNN based approaches, and a significant improvement over previous
Transformer based models. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those equipped with basic computing
resources and/or dealing with important small datasets. Our method works on
larger datasets, such as ImageNet (80.28% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT),
and NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available
at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers.</span>

                                        <span>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably the most popular
meta-learning algorithm nowadays, given its flexibility to incorporate various
model architectures and to be applied to different problems. Nevertheless, its
performance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms
dedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how
to train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that a large
number of gradient steps are needed for the inner loop update, which
contradicts the common usage of MAML for few-shot classification. Second, we
find that MAML is sensitive to the permutation of class assignments in
meta-testing: for a few-shot task of $N$ classes, there are exponentially many
ways to assign the learned initialization of the $N$-way classifier to the $N$
classes, leading to an unavoidably huge variance. Third, we investigate several
ways for permutation invariance and find that learning a shared classifier
initialization for all the classes performs the best. On benchmark datasets
such as MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name
UNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms, while keeping the simplicity of MAML without adding any extra
sub-networks.</span>

                                        <span>Efficient long-short temporal modeling is key for enhancing the performance
of action recognition task. In this paper, we propose a new two-stream action
recognition network, termed as MENet, consisting of a Motion Enhancement (ME)
module and a Video-level Aggregation (VLA) module to achieve long-short
temporal modeling. Specifically, motion representations have been proved
effective in capturing short-term and high-frequency action. However, current
motion representations are calculated from adjacent frames, which may have poor
interpretation and bring useless information (noisy or blank). Thus, for
short-term motions, we design an efficient ME module to enhance the short-term
motions by mingling the motion saliency among neighboring segments. As for
long-term aggregations, VLA is adopted at the top of the appearance branch to
integrate the long-term dependencies across all segments. The two components of
MENet are complementary in temporal modeling. Extensive experiments are
conducted on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks, which verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed MENet.</span>

localization of the eyes from a periocular Near-Infra-Red iris image under
alcohol consumption. The purpose of the system is to measure the fitness for
duty. Fitness systems allow us to determine whether a person is physically or
psychologically able to perform their tasks. Our framework is based on an
object detector trained from scratch to detect both eyes from a single image.
Then, two efficient networks were used for semantic segmentation; a Criss-Cross
attention network and DenseNet10, with only 122,514 and 210,732 parameters,
respectively. These networks can find the pupil, iris, and sclera. In the end,
the binary output eye mask is used for pupil and iris diameter estimation with
high precision. Five state-of-the-art algorithms were used for this purpose. A
mixed proposal reached the best results. A second contribution is establishing
an alcohol behavior curve to detect the alcohol presence utilizing a stream of
images captured from an iris instance. Also, a manually labeled database with
more than 20k images was created. Our best method obtains a mean
Intersection-over-Union of 94.54% with DenseNet10 with only 210,732 parameters
and an error of only 1-pixel on average.</span>

                                        <span>Compared to many other dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation,
it is the arbitrary number of instances that has made instance segmentation
much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream
approaches either follow the &#x27;detect-then-segment&#x27; strategy (e.g., Mask R-CNN),
or predict embedding vectors first then cluster pixels into individual
instances. In this paper, we view the task of instance segmentation from a
completely new perspective by introducing the notion of &quot;instance categories&quot;,
which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the
instance&#x27;s location. With this notion, we propose segmenting objects by
locations (SOLO), a simple, direct, and fast framework for instance
segmentation with strong performance. We derive a few SOLO variants (e.g.,
Vanilla SOLO, Decoupled SOLO, Dynamic SOLO) following the basic principle. Our
method directly maps a raw input image to the desired object categories and
instance masks, eliminating the need for the grouping post-processing or the
bounding box detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for
instance segmentation in terms of both speed and accuracy, while being
considerably simpler than the existing methods. Besides instance segmentation,
our method yields state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask
byproduct) and panoptic segmentation. We further demonstrate the flexibility
and high-quality segmentation of SOLO by extending it to perform one-stage
instance-level image matting. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet</span>

                                        <span>Cell detection in histopathology images is of great value in clinical
practice. \textit{Convolutional neural networks} (CNNs) have been applied to
cell detection to improve the detection accuracy, where cell annotations are
required for network training. However, due to the variety and large number of
cells, complete annotations that include every cell of interest in the training
images can be challenging. Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved,
where positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their
reliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest,
that are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a
lack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply
treat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during
network training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this
work, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the
training of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem.
Specifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take
into account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative
samples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples
of which the labels are unknown. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments
were performed on a publicly available dataset for mitosis detection in breast
cancer cells, and the experimental results show that our method improves the
performance of cell detection given incomplete annotations for training.</span>

a key role in tumor evolution, and yet remains an understudied topic in
computational pathology. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is among the
first to hybrid local and global graph methods to profile orchestration and
interaction of cellular components. To address the challenge in hematolymphoid
cancers where the cell classes in TME are unclear, we first implemented cell
level unsupervised learning and identified two new cell subtypes. Local cell
graphs or supercells were built for each image by considering the individual
cell&#x27;s geospatial location and classes. Then, we applied supercell level
clustering and identified two new cell communities. In the end, we built global
graphs to abstract spatial interaction patterns and extract features for
disease diagnosis. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on H\&amp;E slides of 60
hematolymphoid neoplasm patients and further compared it with three cell level
graph-based algorithms, including the global cell graph, cluster cell graph,
and FLocK. The proposed algorithm achieves a mean diagnosis accuracy of 0.703
with the repeated 5-fold cross-validation scheme. In conclusion, our algorithm
shows superior performance over the existing methods and can be potentially
applied to other cancer types.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-modal imaging is a key healthcare technology in the diagnosis and
management of disease, but it is often underutilized due to costs associated
with multiple separate scans. This limitation yields the need for synthesis of
unacquired modalities from the subset of available modalities. In recent years,
generative adversarial network (GAN) models with superior depiction of
structural details have been established as state-of-the-art in numerous
medical image synthesis tasks. However, GANs are characteristically based on
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones that perform local processing with
compact filters. This inductive bias, in turn, compromises learning of
long-range spatial dependencies. While attention maps incorporated in GANs can
multiplicatively modulate CNN features to emphasize critical image regions,
their capture of global context is mostly implicit. Here, we propose a novel
generative adversarial approach for medical image synthesis, ResViT, to combine
local precision of convolution operators with contextual sensitivity of vision
transformers. Based on an encoder-decoder architecture, ResViT employs a
central bottleneck comprising novel aggregated residual transformer (ART)
blocks that synergistically combine convolutional and transformer modules.
Comprehensive demonstrations are performed for synthesizing missing sequences
in multi-contrast MRI and CT images from MRI. Our results indicate the
superiority of ResViT against competing methods in terms of qualitative
observations and quantitative metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved great success due to the
powerful feature learning ability of convolution layers. Specifically, the
standard convolution traverses the input images/features using a sliding window
scheme to extract features. However, not all the windows contribute equally to
the prediction results of CNNs. In practice, the convolutional operation on
some of the windows (e.g., smooth windows that contain very similar pixels) can
be very redundant and may introduce noises into the computation. Such
redundancy may not only deteriorate the performance but also incur the
unnecessary computational cost. Thus, it is important to reduce the
computational redundancy of convolution to improve the performance. To this
end, we propose a Content-aware Convolution (CAC) that automatically detects
the smooth windows and applies a 1x1 convolutional kernel to replace the
original large kernel. In this sense, we are able to effectively avoid the
redundant computation on similar pixels. By replacing the standard convolution
in CNNs with our CAC, the resultant models yield significantly better
performance and lower computational cost than the baseline models with the
standard convolution. More critically, we are able to dynamically allocate
suitable computation resources according to the data smoothness of different
images, making it possible for content-aware computation. Extensive experiments
on various computer vision tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over
existing methods.</span>

sequence, is a central component in multi-object tracking (MOT). To train
association modules, e.g., parametric networks, real video data are usually
used. However, annotating person tracks in consecutive video frames is
expensive, and such real data, due to its inflexibility, offer us limited
opportunities to evaluate the system performance w.r.t changing tracking
scenarios. In this paper, we study whether 3D synthetic data can replace
real-world videos for association training. Specifically, we introduce a
large-scale synthetic data engine named MOTX, where the motion characteristics
of cameras and objects are manually configured to be similar to those in
real-world datasets. We show that compared with real data, association
knowledge obtained from synthetic data can achieve very similar performance on
real-world test sets without domain adaption techniques. Our intriguing
observation is credited to two factors. First and foremost, 3D engines can well
simulate motion factors such as camera movement, camera view and object
movement, so that the simulated videos can provide association modules with
effective motion features. Second, experimental results show that the
appearance domain gap hardly harms the learning of association knowledge. In
addition, the strong customization ability of MOTX allows us to quantitatively
assess the impact of motion factors on MOT, which brings new insights to the
community.</span>

Recently, with the rapid advancement of emotional intelligence and the
explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated
to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this survey, we will
comprehensively review the development of AICA in the recent two decades,
especially focusing on the state-of-the-art methods with respect to three main
challenges -- the affective gap, perception subjectivity, and label noise and
absence. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models
that have been widely employed in AICA and description of available datasets
for performing evaluation with quantitative comparison of label noise and
dataset bias. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on
(1) emotion feature extraction, including both handcrafted and deep features,
(2) learning methods on dominant emotion recognition, personalized emotion
prediction, emotion distribution learning, and learning from noisy data or few
labels, and (3) AICA based applications. Finally, we discuss some challenges
and promising research directions in the future, such as image content and
context understanding, group emotion clustering, and viewer-image interaction.</span>

semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To
counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is
known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the
Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks.
Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such
single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training.
Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of
single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we
address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic
segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the
robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not
increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training
considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of
meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with
multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic
segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Images obtained in real-world low-light conditions are not only low in
brightness, but they also suffer from many other types of degradation, such as
color bias, unknown noise, detail loss and halo artifacts. In this paper, we
propose a very fast deep learning framework called Bringing the Lightness
(denoted as BLNet) that consists of two U-Nets with a series of well-designed
loss functions to tackle all of the above degradations. Based on Retinex
Theory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into
reflectance and illumination and remove noise in the reflectance during the
decomposition phase. We propose a Noise and Color Bias Control module (NCBC
Module) that contains a convolutional neural network and two loss functions
(noise loss and color loss). This module is only used to calculate the loss
functions during the training phase, so our method is very fast during the test
phase. This module can smooth the reflectance to achieve the purpose of noise
removal while preserving details and edge information and controlling color
bias. We propose a network that can be trained to learn the mapping between
low-light and normal-light illumination and enhance the brightness of images
taken in low-light illumination. We train and evaluate the performance of our
proposed model over the real-world Low-Light (LOL) dataset), and we also test
our model over several other frequently used datasets (LIME, DICM and MEF
datasets). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach
achieves a promising effect with good rubustness and generalization and
outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and
quantitatively. Our method achieves high speed because we use loss functions
instead of introducing additional denoisers for noise removal and color
correction. The code and model are available at

                                        <span>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for
object detection in overhead (e.g., satellite) imagery. One ongoing challenge
however is the acquisition of training data, due to high costs of obtaining
satellite imagery and annotating objects in it. In this work we present a
simple approach - termed Synthetic object IMPLantation (SIMPL) - to easily and
rapidly generate large quantities of synthetic overhead training data for
custom target objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using SIMPL
synthetic imagery for training DNNs in zero-shot scenarios where no real
imagery is available; and few-shot learning scenarios, where limited real-world
imagery is available. We also conduct experiments to study the sensitivity of
SIMPL&#x27;s effectiveness to some key design parameters, providing users for
insights when designing synthetic imagery for custom objects. We release a
software implementation of our SIMPL approach so that others can build upon it,
or use it for their own custom problems.</span>

                                        <span>Transformers provide promising accuracy and have become popular and used in
various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision.
However, due to their massive number of model parameters, memory and
computation requirements, they are not suitable for resource-constrained
low-power devices. Even with high-performance and specialized devices, the
memory bandwidth can become a performance-limiting bottleneck. In this paper,
we present a performance analysis of state-of-the-art vision transformers on
several devices. We propose to reduce the overall memory footprint and memory
transfers by clustering the model parameters. We show that by using only 64
clusters to represent model parameters, it is possible to reduce the data
transfer from the main memory by more than 4x, achieve up to 22% speedup and
39% energy savings on mobile devices with less than 0.1% accuracy loss.</span>

on 3D meshes for 3D object segmentation and classification. We use the faces of
the mesh as basic processing units and represent a 3D mesh as a graph where
each node corresponds to a face. To enhance the descriptive power of the graph,
we introduce a 1-ring face neighbourhood structure to derive novel
multi-dimensional spatial and structure features to represent the graph nodes.
Based on this new graph representation, we then design a densely connected
graph convolutional block which aggregates local and regional features as the
key construction component to build effective and efficient practical GCN
models for 3D object classification and segmentation. We will present
experimental results to show that our new technique outperforms state of the
art where our models are shown to have the smallest number of parameters and
consietently achieve the highest accuracies across a number of benchmark
datasets. We will also present ablation studies to demonstrate the soundness of

on out-of-distribution data, accuracies on in- versus out-of-distribution data
are widely observed to follow a single linear trend when evaluated across a
testbed of models. Models that are more accurate on the out-of-distribution
data relative to this baseline exhibit &quot;effective robustness&quot; and are
exceedingly rare. Identifying such models, and understanding their properties,
is key to improving out-of-distribution performance. We conduct a thorough
empirical investigation of effective robustness during fine-tuning and
surprisingly find that models pre-trained on larger datasets exhibit effective
robustness during training that vanishes at convergence. We study how
properties of the data influence effective robustness, and we show that it
increases with the larger size, more diversity, and higher example difficulty
of the dataset. We also find that models that display effective robustness are
able to correctly classify 10% of the examples that no other current testbed
model gets correct. Finally, we discuss several strategies for scaling
effective robustness to the high-accuracy regime to improve the
out-of-distribution accuracy of state-of-the-art models.</span>

e.g., Credential Authentication Technology (CAT), used by Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), which is a non-trivial security concern. To
overcome the risks incurred due to morphed presentations, we propose a
wavelet-based morph detection methodology which adopts an end-to-end trainable
soft attention mechanism . Our attention-based deep neural network (DNN)
focuses on the salient Regions of Interest (ROI) which have the most spatial
support for morph detector decision function, i.e, morph class binary softmax
output. A retrospective of morph synthesizing procedure aids us to speculate
the ROI as regions around facial landmarks , particularly for the case of
landmark-based morphing techniques. Moreover, our attention-based DNN is
adapted to the wavelet space, where inputs of the network are coarse-to-fine
spectral representations, 48 stacked wavelet sub-bands to be exact. We evaluate
performance of the proposed framework using three datasets, VISAPP17, LMA, and
MorGAN. In addition, as attention maps can be a robust indicator whether a
probe image under investigation is genuine or counterfeit, we analyze the
estimated attention maps for both a bona fide image and its corresponding
morphed image. Finally, we present an ablation study on the efficacy of
utilizing attention mechanism for the sake of morph detection.</span>

diagnosis and can provide invaluable guidance for the treatment of cardiac
diseases. Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been successful for its efficacy in guiding the clinical diagnosis
and treatment reliably. For LGE CMR, many methods have demonstrated success in
accurately segmenting scarring regions. Co-registration with other
non-contrast-agent (non-CA) modalities, balanced steady-state free precession
(bSSFP) and cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for example, can further
enhance the efficacy of automated segmentation of cardiac anatomies. Many
conventional methods have been proposed to provide automated or semi-automated
segmentation of scars. With the development of deep learning in recent years,
we can also see more advanced methods that are more efficient in providing more
accurate segmentations. This paper conducts a state-of-the-art review of
conventional and current state-of-the-art approaches utilising different
modalities for accurate cardiac fibrosis and scar segmentation.</span>

exceedingly overwhelming for human researchers who seek to timely extract and
review knowledge. This paper introduces natural language processing (NLP)
models to accelerate the discovery, extraction, and organization of theoretical
developments (i.e., hypotheses) from social science publications. We illustrate
and evaluate NLP models in the context of a systematic review of stakeholder
value constructs and hypotheses. Specifically, we develop NLP models to
automatically 1) detect sentences in scholarly documents as hypotheses or not
(Hypothesis Detection), 2) deconstruct the hypotheses into nodes (constructs)
and links (causal/associative relationships) (Relationship Deconstruction ),
and 3) classify the features of links in terms causality (versus association)
and direction (positive, negative, versus nonlinear) (Feature Classification).
Our models have reported high performance metrics for all three tasks. While
our models are built in Python, we have made the pre-trained models fully
accessible for non-programmers. We have provided instructions on installing and
using our pre-trained models via an R Shiny app graphic user interface (GUI).
Finally, we suggest the next paths to extend our methodology for
computer-assisted knowledge synthesis.</span>

                                        <span>We discuss a novel task, Chorus Recognition, which could potentially benefit
downstream tasks such as song search and music summarization. Different from
the existing tasks such as music summarization or lyrics summarization relying
on single-modal information, this paper models chorus recognition as a
multi-modal one by utilizing both the lyrics and the tune information of songs.
We propose a multi-modal Chorus Recognition model that considers diverse
features. Besides, we also create and publish the first Chorus Recognition
dataset containing 627 songs for public use. Our empirical study performed on
the dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms several baselines in
chorus recognition. In addition, our approach also helps to improve the
accuracy of its downstream task - song search by more than 10.6%.</span>

                                        <span>Online competitive games have become a mainstream entertainment platform. To
create a fair and exciting experience, these games use rating systems to match
players with similar skills. While there has been an increasing amount of
research on improving the performance of these systems, less attention has been
paid to how their performance is evaluated. In this paper, we explore the
utility of several metrics for evaluating three popular rating systems on a
real-world dataset of over 25,000 team battle royale matches. Our results
suggest considerable differences in their evaluation patterns. Some metrics
were highly impacted by the inclusion of new players. Many could not capture
the real differences between certain groups of players. Among all metrics
studied, normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) demonstrated more
reliable performance and more flexibility. It alleviated most of the challenges
faced by the other metrics while adding the freedom to adjust the focus of the
evaluations on different groups of players.</span>

questions into conversational ones by incorporating some conversational
characteristics, e.g., anaphora and ellipsis. Existing maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) based methods often get trapped in easily learned tokens as
all tokens are treated equally during training. In this work, we introduce a
Reinforcement Iterative Sequence Editing (RISE) framework that optimizes the
minimum Levenshtein distance (MLD) through explicit editing actions. RISE is
able to pay attention to tokens that are related to conversational
characteristics. To train RISE, we devise an Iterative Reinforce Training (IRT)
algorithm with a Dynamic Programming based Sampling (DPS) process to improve
exploration. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that RISE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on

writers in the news domain to develop event-centric narratives. Given an
incomplete narrative that specifies a main event and a context, we aim to
retrieve news articles that discuss relevant events that would enable the

datasets derived from this procedure show that state-of-the-art lexical and
semantic rankers are not sufficient for this task. We show that combining those
with a ranker that ranks articles by reverse chronological order outperforms
those rankers alone. We also perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative

(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into
the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model
arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has
demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation has been broadly studied in this decade.
Recently, the next POI recommendation, a natural extension of POI
recommendation, has attracted much attention. It aims at suggesting the next
POI to a user in spatial and temporal context, which is a practical yet
challenging task in various applications. Existing approaches mainly model the
spatial and temporal information, and memorize historical patterns through
user&#x27;s trajectories for recommendation. However, they suffer from the negative
impact of missing and irregular check-in data, which significantly influences
the model performance. In this paper, we propose an attention-based
sequence-to-sequence generative model, namely POI-Augmentation Seq2Seq
(PA-Seq2Seq), to address the sparsity of training set by making check-in
records to be evenly-spaced. Specifically, the encoder summarises each check-in
sequence and the decoder predicts the possible missing check-ins based on the
encoded information. In order to learn time-aware correlation among user
history, we employ local attention mechanism to help the decoder focus on a
specific range of context information when predicting a certain missing
check-in point. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world
check-in datasets, Gowalla and Brightkite, for performance and effectiveness
evaluation.</span>

challenge. Apart from many domain-independent text summarization algorithms
that can be used for this purpose, several algorithms have been developed
specifically for summarizing legal case documents. However, most of the
existing algorithms do not systematically incorporate domain knowledge that
specifies what information should ideally be present in a legal case document
summary. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised summarization
algorithm DELSumm which is designed to systematically incorporate guidelines
from legal experts into an optimization setup. We conduct detailed experiments
over case documents from the Indian Supreme Court. The experiments show that
our proposed unsupervised method outperforms several strong baselines in terms
of ROUGE scores, including both general summarization algorithms and
legal-specific ones. In fact, though our proposed algorithm is unsupervised, it
outperforms several supervised summarization models that are trained over

                                        <span>Robust recommendation aims at capturing true preference of users from noisy
data, for which there are two lines of methods have been proposed. One is based
on noise injection, and the other is to adopt the generative model Variational
Auto-encoder (VAE). However, the existing works still face two challenges.
First, the noise injection based methods often draw the noise from a fixed
noise distribution given in advance, while in real world, the noise
distributions of different users and items may differ from each other due to
personal behaviors and item usage patterns. Second, the VAE based models are
not expressive enough to capture the true preference since VAE often yields an
embedding space of a single modal, while in real world, user-item interactions
usually exhibit multi-modality on user preference distribution. In this paper,
we propose a novel model called Dual Adversarial Variational Embedding (DAVE)
for robust recommendation, which can provide personalized noise reduction for
different users and items, and capture the multi-modality of the embedding
space, by combining the advantages of VAE and adversarial training between the
introduced auxiliary discriminators and the variational inference networks. The
extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the effectiveness of
DAVE on robust recommendation.</span>

                                        <span>Being an indispensable component in location-based social networks, next
point-of-interest (POI) recommendation recommends users unexplored POIs based
on their recent visiting histories. However, existing work mainly models
check-in data as isolated POI sequences, neglecting the crucial collaborative
signals from cross-sequence check-in information. Furthermore, the sparse
POI-POI transitions restrict the ability of a model to learn effective
sequential patterns for recommendation. In this paper, we propose
Sequence-to-Graph (Seq2Graph) augmentation for each POI sequence, allowing
collaborative signals to be propagated from correlated POIs belonging to other
sequences. We then devise a novel Sequence-to-Graph POI Recommender (SGRec),
which jointly learns POI embeddings and infers a user&#x27;s temporal preferences
from the graph-augmented POI sequence. To overcome the sparsity of POI-level
interactions, we further infuse category-awareness into SGRec with a multi-task
learning scheme that captures the denser category-wise transitions. As such,
SGRec makes full use of the collaborative signals for learning expressive POI
representations, and also comprehensively uncovers multi-level sequential
patterns for user preference modelling. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SGRec against state-of-the-art methods
in next POI recommendation.</span>

to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular,
without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual
blocks. We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer
(FPT), and study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks
spanning numerical computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In
contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as
the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can
improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks.
Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the
performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the
two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong

Specifically, the proposed method is formulated as to construct a linear

computed via a variational Bayesian formulation, i.e., by minimizing the

mapping and the actual posterior. A gradient descent scheme is proposed to

bottlenecks in synchronous data-parallel training. To alleviate these
bottlenecks, a long line of recent work proposes gradient and model compression
methods. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of gradient compression methods
and compare their scalability with optimized implementations of synchronous
data-parallel SGD across more than 200 different setups. Surprisingly, we
observe that only in 6 cases out of more than 200, gradient compression methods
provide speedup over optimized synchronous data-parallel training in the
typical data-center setting. We conduct an extensive investigation to identify
the root causes of this phenomenon, and offer a performance model that can be
used to identify the benefits of gradient compression for a variety of system
setups. Based on our analysis, we propose a list of desirable properties that

to be solved for integrating renewable energies and distributed storage into
future electrical grids. In this work, we introduce Gym-ANM, a framework for
designing reinforcement learning (RL) environments that model ANM tasks in
electricity distribution networks. These environments provide new playgrounds
for RL research in the management of electricity networks that do not require
an extensive knowledge of the underlying dynamics of such systems. Along with
this work, we are releasing an implementation of an introductory
toy-environment, ANM6-Easy, designed to emphasize common challenges in ANM. We
also show that state-of-the-art RL algorithms can already achieve good
performance on ANM6-Easy when compared against a model predictive control (MPC)
approach. Finally, we provide guidelines to create new Gym-ANM environments
differing in terms of (a) the distribution network topology and parameters, (b)
the observation space, (c) the modelling of the stochastic processes present in
the system, and (d) a set of hyperparameters influencing the reward signal.

                                        <span>Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This
has motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language,
in order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential
weaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard
attention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by
constant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,
which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.
In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated
attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the
attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated
transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With
some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a
saturated transformer memory vector is $O(\log n)$, which implies saturated
transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard
to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer&#x27;s
effective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\log n)$.</span>

                                        <span>Policy optimization methods are popular reinforcement learning algorithms,
because their incremental and on-policy nature makes them more stable than the
value-based counterparts. However, the same properties also make them slow to
converge and sample inefficient, as the on-policy requirement precludes data
reuse and the incremental updates couple large iteration complexity into the
sample complexity. These characteristics have been observed in experiments as
well as in theory in the recent work of~\citet{agarwal2020pc}, which provides a
policy optimization method PCPG that can robustly find near optimal polices for
approximately linear Markov decision processes but suffers from an extremely
poor sample complexity compared with value-based techniques.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, COPOE, that overcomes the sample
complexity issue of PCPG while retaining its robustness to model
misspecification. Compared with PCPG, COPOE makes several important algorithmic
enhancements, such as enabling data reuse, and uses more refined analysis
techniques, which we expect to be more broadly applicable to designing new
reinforcement learning algorithms. The result is an improvement in sample
complexity from $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{11})$ for PCPG to
$\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ for PCPG, nearly bridging the gap with
value-based techniques.</span>

formalized by Moshkovitz, Dasgupta, Rashtchian, and Frost (ICML 2020). A
$k$-clustering is said to be explainable if it is given by a decision tree
where each internal node splits data points with a threshold cut in a single
dimension (feature), and each of the $k$ leaves corresponds to a cluster. We
give an algorithm that outputs an explainable clustering that loses at most a
factor of $O(\log^2 k)$ compared to an optimal (not necessarily explainable)
clustering for the $k$-medians objective, and a factor of $O(k \log^2 k)$ for
the $k$-means objective. This improves over the previous best upper bounds of
$O(k)$ and $O(k^2)$, respectively, and nearly matches the previous $\Omega(\log
k)$ lower bound for $k$-medians and our new $\Omega(k)$ lower bound for
$k$-means. The algorithm is remarkably simple. In particular, given an initial
not necessarily explainable clustering in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it is oblivious to
the data points and runs in time $O(dk \log^2 k)$, independent of the number of
data points $n$. Our upper and lower bounds also generalize to objectives given

how do we acquire good macro-actions? This paper proposes Macro-Action
Generator-Critic (MAGIC), which performs offline learning of macro-actions
optimized for online POMDP planning. Specifically, MAGIC learns a macro-action
generator end-to-end, using an online planner&#x27;s performance as the feedback.
During online planning, the generator generates on the fly situation-aware
macro-actions conditioned on the robot&#x27;s belief and the environment context. We
evaluated MAGIC on several long-horizon planning tasks both in simulation and
on a real robot. The experimental results show that the learned macro-actions
offer significant benefits in online planning performance, compared with
primitive actions and handcrafted macro-actions.</span>

stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and of full-batch gradient descent (GD) in
the fundamental stochastic convex optimization model. While for SGD it is
well-known that $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations suffice for obtaining a solution
with $\epsilon$ excess expected risk, we show that with the same number of
steps GD may overfit and emit a solution with $\Omega(1)$ generalization error.
Moreover, we show that in fact $\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations are necessary
for GD to match the generalization performance of SGD, which is also tight due
to recent work by Bassily et al. (2020). We further discuss how regularizing
the empirical risk minimized by GD essentially does not change the above
result, and revisit the concepts of stability, implicit bias and the role of
the learning algorithm in generalization.</span>

                                        <span>Current black-box variational inference (BBVI) methods require the user to
make numerous design choices -- such as the selection of variational objective
and approximating family -- yet there is little principled guidance on how to
do so. We develop a conceptual framework and set of experimental tools to
understand the effects of these choices, which we leverage to propose best
practices for maximizing posterior approximation accuracy. Our approach is
based on studying the pre-asymptotic tail behavior of the density ratios
between the joint distribution and the variational approximation, then
exploiting insights and tools from the importance sampling literature. Our
framework and supporting experiments help to distinguish between the behavior
of BBVI methods for approximating low-dimensional versus
moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors. In the latter case, we show that
mass-covering variational objectives are difficult to optimize and do not
improve accuracy, but flexible variational families can improve accuracy and
the effectiveness of importance sampling -- at the cost of additional
optimization challenges. Therefore, for moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors
we recommend using the (mode-seeking) exclusive KL divergence since it is the
easiest to optimize, and improving the variational family or using model
parameter transformations to make the posterior and optimal variational
approximation more similar. On the other hand, in low-dimensional settings, we
show that heavy-tailed variational families and mass-covering divergences are
effective and can increase the chances that the approximation can be improved
by importance sampling.</span>

                                        <span>Scalable training of large models (like BERT and GPT-3) requires careful
optimization rooted in model design, architecture, and system capabilities.
From a system standpoint, communication has become a major bottleneck,
especially on commodity systems with standard TCP interconnects that offer
limited network bandwidth. Communication compression is an important technique
to reduce training time on such systems. One of the most effective methods is
error-compensated compression, which offers robust convergence speed even under
1-bit compression. However, state-of-the-art error compensation techniques only
work with basic optimizers like SGD and momentum SGD, which are linearly
dependent on the gradients. They do not work with non-linear gradient-based
optimizers like Adam, which offer state-of-the-art convergence efficiency and
accuracy for models like BERT. In this paper, we propose 1-bit Adam that
reduces the communication volume by up to $5\times$, offers much better
scalability, and provides the same convergence speed as uncompressed Adam. Our
key finding is that Adam&#x27;s variance (non-linear term) becomes stable (after a
warmup phase) and can be used as a fixed precondition for the rest of the
training (compression phase). Experiments on up to 256 GPUs show that 1-bit
Adam enables up to $3.3\times$ higher throughput for BERT-Large pre-training
and up to $2.9\times$ higher throughput for SQuAD fine-tuning. In addition, we
provide theoretical analysis for our proposed work.</span>

Cognitive Networks (LSTCNs) as a generalisation of the Short-term Cognitive
Network (STCN) model. Such a generalisation is motivated by the difficulty of
forecasting very long time series in an efficient, greener fashion. The LSTCN
model can be defined as a collection of STCN blocks, each processing a specific
time patch of the (multivariate) time series being modelled. In this neural
ensemble, each block passes information to the subsequent one in the form of a
weight matrix referred to as the prior knowledge matrix. As a second
contribution, we propose a deterministic learning algorithm to compute the
learnable weights while preserving the prior knowledge resulting from previous
learning processes. As a third contribution, we introduce a feature influence
score as a proxy to explain the forecasting process in multivariate time
series. The simulations using three case studies show that our neural system
reports small forecasting errors while being up to thousands of times faster
than state-of-the-art recurrent models.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) starts to be widely used to enhance the performance of
multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receivers. However, it is
still unclear if such methods are truly competitive with respect to
conventional methods in realistic scenarios and under practical constraints. In
addition to enabling accurate signal reconstruction on realistic channel
models, MU-MIMO receive algorithms must allow for easy adaptation to a varying
number of users without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing work,
we propose an ML-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver that builds on top of a conventional
linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) architecture. It preserves the
interpretability and scalability of the LMMSE receiver, while improving its
accuracy in two ways. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to
compute an approximation of the second-order statistics of the channel
estimation error which are required for accurate equalization. Second, a
CNN-based demapper jointly processes a large number of orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols and subcarriers, which allows it
to compute better log likelihood ratios (LLRs) by compensating for channel
aging. The resulting architecture can be used in the up- and downlink and is
trained in an end-to-end manner, removing the need for hard-to-get perfect
channel state information (CSI) during the training phase. Simulation results
demonstrate consistent performance improvements over the baseline which are
especially pronounced in high mobility scenarios.</span>

that waste energy and lack predictability. In this work, we present a novel
paradigm of controlling nonlinear systems via the minimization of the Koopman

This induces a broader class of dynamical behaviors that evolve over stable
manifolds such as nonlinear oscillators, closed loops, and smooth movements. We
demonstrate that some dynamics realizations that are not possible with a
cumulative cost are feasible in this paradigm. Moreover, we present a provably

several different approaches like $\epsilon$-differential privacy, federated
machine learning and methods based on cryptographic approaches if the datasets
cannot be shared or evaluated jointly at one place. In this setting, it can
also be a problem to compute the global performance measure like an AUC, since
the labels might also contain privacy-sensitive information. There have been
approaches based on $\epsilon$-differential privacy to deal with this problem,
but to the best of our knowledge, no exact privacy preserving solution has been
introduced. In this paper, we propose an MPC-based framework, called \fw{},
with private merging of sorted lists and novel methods for comparing two
secret-shared values, selecting between two secret-shared values, converting
the modulus, and performing division to compute the exact AUC as one could
obtain on the pooled original test samples. With \fw{} computation of the exact
area under precision-recall curve and receiver operating characteristic curve
is even possible when ties between prediction confidence values exist. To show
the applicability of \fw{}, we use it to evaluate a model trained to predict
acute myeloid leukemia therapy response and we also assess its scalability via
experiments on synthetic data. The experiments show that we efficiently compute
exactly the same AUC with both evaluation metrics in a privacy preserving
manner as one can obtain on the pooled test samples in the plaintext domain.
Our solution provides security against semi-honest corruption of at most one of
the servers performing the secure computation.</span>

                                        <span>Particle Filtering (PF) methods are an established class of procedures for
performing inference in non-linear state-space models. Resampling is a key
ingredient of PF, necessary to obtain low variance likelihood and states
estimates. However, traditional resampling methods result in PF-based loss
functions being non-differentiable with respect to model and PF parameters. In
a variational inference context, resampling also yields high variance gradient
estimates of the PF-based evidence lower bound. By leveraging optimal transport

                                        <span>The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is a combinatorial
optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total score collected
from different visited locations. The application of neural network models to
combinatorial optimization has recently shown promising results in dealing with
similar problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A neural network allows
learning solutions using reinforcement learning or supervised learning,
depending on the available data. After the learning stage, it can be
generalized and quickly fine-tuned to further improve performance and
personalization. The advantages are evident since, for real-world applications,
solution quality, personalization, and execution times are all important
factors that should be taken into account.

This study explores the use of Pointer Network models trained using
reinforcement learning to solve the OPTW problem. We propose a modified
architecture that leverages Pointer Networks to better address problems related
with dynamic time-dependent constraints. Among its various applications, the
OPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We train the
Pointer Network with the TTDP problem in mind, by sampling variables that can
change across tourists visiting a particular instance-region: starting
position, starting time, available time, and the scores given to each point of
interest. Once a model-region is trained, it can infer a solution for a
particular tourist using beam search. We based the assessment of our approach
on several existing benchmark OPTW instances. We show that it generalizes
across different tourists that visit each region and that it generally
outperforms the most commonly used heuristic, while computing the solution in
realistic times.</span>

important research objective to understand their behavior in modern
applications involving autoencoders and loop unrolling techniques, among
others. In particular, we focus on networks with nonnegative inputs and
nonnegative network parameters, as often considered in the literature. We show
that such networks can be recognized as monotonic and (weakly) scalable
functions within the framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact
enables us to derive conditions for the existence of a nonempty fixed point set
of the neural networks, and these conditions are weaker than those obtained
recently using arguments in convex analysis, which are typically based on the
assumption of nonexpansivity of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove
that the shape of the fixed point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural
networks is often an interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of
scalable networks. The chief results of this paper are verified in numerical
simulations, where we consider an autoencoder-type network that first
compresses angular power spectra in massive MIMO systems, and, second,
reconstruct the input spectra from the compressed signal.</span>

                                        <span>Variational Inference (VI) is a popular alternative to asymptotically exact
sampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a
reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the
tail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy.
Importance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and
de-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality
of IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally,
the proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely
achievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of
optimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by
constructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward
KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast
convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational
approximation. We empirically demonstrate on real data that our method is
competitive with variational boosting and MCMC.</span>

                                        <span>Current radio frequency (RF) sensors at the Edge lack the computational
resources to support practical, in-situ training for intelligent spectrum
monitoring, and sensor data classification in general. We propose a solution
via Deep Delay Loop Reservoir Computing (DLR), a processing architecture that
supports general machine learning algorithms on compact mobile devices by
leveraging delay-loop reservoir computing in combination with innovative
electrooptical hardware. With both digital and photonic realizations of our
design of the loops, DLR delivers reductions in form factor, hardware
complexity and latency, compared to the State-of-the-Art (SoA). The main impact
of the reservoir is to project the input data into a higher dimensional space
of reservoir state vectors in order to linearly separate the input classes.
Once the classes are well separated, traditionally complex, power-hungry
classification models are no longer needed for the learning process. Yet, even
with simple classifiers based on Ridge regression (RR), the complexity grows at
least quadratically with the input size. Hence, the hardware reduction required
for training on compact devices is in contradiction with the large dimension of
state vectors. DLR employs a RR-based classifier to exceed the SoA accuracy,
while further reducing power consumption by leveraging the architecture of
parallel (split) loops. We present DLR architectures composed of multiple
smaller loops whose state vectors are linearly combined to create a lower
dimensional input into Ridge regression. We demonstrate the advantages of using
DLR for two distinct applications: RF Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) for
IoT authentication, and wireless protocol recognition for IoT situational
awareness.</span>

customer concerns and enhance customer order experience. Because customer
feedback often contains redundant information, a concise summary of the
feedback can be generated to help sellers better understand the issues causing
customer dissatisfaction. Previous state-of-the-art abstractive text
summarization models make two major types of factual errors when producing
summaries from customer feedback, which are wrong entity detection (WED) and
incorrect product-defect description (IPD). In this work, we introduce a set of
methods to enhance the factual consistency of abstractive summarization on
customer feedback. We augment the training data with artificially corrupted
summaries, and use them as counterparts of the target summaries. We add a
contrastive loss term into the training objective so that the model learns to
avoid certain factual errors. Evaluation results show that a large portion of
WED and IPD errors are alleviated for BART and T5. Furthermore, our approaches
do not depend on the structure of the summarization model and thus are
generalizable to any abstractive summarization systems.</span>

multiple interconnected agents aim to learn an optimal decision function
defined over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by jointly minimizing a global
objective function, with access to their own locally observed dataset. As a
non-parametric approach, kernel learning faces a major challenge in distributed
implementation: the decision variables of local objective functions are
data-dependent and thus cannot be optimized under the decentralized consensus
framework without any raw data exchange among agents. To circumvent this major
challenge, we leverage the random feature (RF) approximation approach to enable
consensus on the function modeled in the RF space by data-independent
parameters across different agents. We then design an iterative algorithm,
termed DKLA, for fast-convergent implementation via ADMM. Based on DKLA, we
further develop a communication-censored kernel learning (COKE) algorithm that
reduces the communication load of DKLA by preventing an agent from transmitting
at every iteration unless its local updates are deemed informative. Theoretical
results in terms of linear convergence guarantee and generalization performance
analysis of DKLA and COKE are provided. Comprehensive tests on both synthetic
and real datasets are conducted to verify the communication efficiency and
learning effectiveness of COKE.</span>

receiver solution for demodulating OFDM signals that are subject to a high
level of nonlinear distortion. Specifically, a novel deep learning based
convolutional neural network receiver is devised, containing layers in both
time- and frequency domains, allowing to demodulate and decode the transmitted
bits reliably despite the high error vector magnitude (EVM) in the transmit
signal. Extensive set of numerical results is provided, in the context of 5G NR
uplink incorporating also measured terminal power amplifier characteristics.
The obtained results show that the proposed receiver system is able to clearly
outperform classical linear receivers as well as existing ML receiver
approaches, especially when the EVM is high in comparison with modulation
order. The proposed ML receiver can thus facilitate pushing the terminal power
amplifier (PA) systems deeper into saturation, and thereon improve the terminal
power-efficiency, radiated power and network coverage.</span>

                                        <span>The Hessian of a neural network captures parameter interactions through
second-order derivatives of the loss. It is a fundamental object of study,
closely tied to various problems in deep learning, including model design,
optimization, and generalization. Most prior work has been empirical, typically
focusing on low-rank approximations and heuristics that are blind to the
network structure. In contrast, we develop theoretical tools to analyze the
range of the Hessian map, providing us with a precise understanding of its rank
deficiency as well as the structural reasons behind it. This yields exact
formulas and tight upper bounds for the Hessian rank of deep linear networks,
allowing for an elegant interpretation in terms of rank deficiency. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our bounds remain faithful as an estimate of the numerical
Hessian rank, for a larger class of models such as rectified and hyperbolic
tangent networks. Further, we also investigate the implications of model
architecture (e.g.~width, depth, bias) on the rank deficiency. Overall, our
work provides novel insights into the source and extent of redundancy in
overparameterized networks.</span>

differential equations (SDEs) for Bayesian posterior sampling, and we study the
two types of errors that arise from numerical SDE simulation: the
discretization error and the error due to noisy gradient estimates in the
context of data subsampling. We consider overlooked results describing the
ergodic convergence rates of numerical integration schemes, and we produce a
novel analysis for the effect of mini-batches through the lens of differential
operator splitting. In our analysis, the stochastic component of the proposed
Hamiltonian SDE is decoupled from the gradient noise, for which we make no
normality assumptions. This allows us to derive interesting connections among
different sampling schemes, including the original Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) algorithm, and explain their performance. We show that for a careful
selection of numerical integrators, both errors vanish at a rate
$\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$, where $\eta$ is the integrator step size. Our

algorithms remain sensitive to hyperparameters. As such, there has recently
been interest in the field of AutoRL, which seeks to automate design decisions
to create more general algorithms. Recent work suggests that population based
approaches may be effective AutoRL algorithms, by learning hyperparameter
schedules on the fly. In particular, the PB2 algorithm is able to achieve
strong performance in RL tasks by formulating online hyperparameter
optimization as time varying GP-bandit problem, while also providing
theoretical guarantees. However, PB2 is only designed to work for continuous
hyperparameters, which severely limits its utility in practice. In this paper
we introduce a new (provably) efficient hierarchical approach for optimizing
both continuous and categorical variables, using a new time-varying bandit
algorithm specifically designed for the population based training regime. We
evaluate our approach on the challenging Procgen benchmark, where we show that
explicitly modelling dependence between data augmentation and other

However, due to their massive number of model parameters, memory and
computation requirements, they are not suitable for resource-constrained
low-power devices. Even with high-performance and specialized devices, the
memory bandwidth can become a performance-limiting bottleneck. In this paper,
we present a performance analysis of state-of-the-art vision transformers on

transfers by clustering the model parameters. We show that by using only 64
clusters to represent model parameters, it is possible to reduce the data
transfer from the main memory by more than 4x, achieve up to 22% speedup and
39% energy savings on mobile devices with less than 0.1% accuracy loss.</span>

to study complex higher-order network interactions among multiple entities. Our
framework covers several popular models in recent network analysis literature,
including mixture multi-layer latent space model and hypergraph latent space
model. We formulate the relationship between the latent positions and the
observed data via a generalized multilinear kernel as the link function. While
our model enjoys decent generality, its maximum likelihood parameter estimation
is also convenient via a generalized tensor decomposition procedure.We propose
a novel algorithm using projected gradient descent on Grassmannians. We also
develop original theoretical guarantees for our algorithm. First, we show its
linear convergence under mild conditions. Second, we establish finite-sample
statistical error rates of latent position estimation, determined by the signal
strength, degrees of freedom and the smoothness of link function, for both
general and specific latent space models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method on synthetic data. We also showcase the merit of our method on two
real-world datasets that are conventionally described by different specific
models in producing meaningful and interpretable parameter estimations and
accurate link prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on

updates sent over an error-prone channel from an energy-harvesting transmitter
with a finite-capacity battery. Energy cost of sensing new status updates is
taken into account as well as the transmission energy cost better capturing
practical systems. The optimal scheduling policy is first studied under the
hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol when the channel and energy

(UAV) swarm network (USNET) that is required to quickly rebuild the
communication connectivity under unpredictable external disruptions (UEDs).
Firstly, to cope with the one-off UEDs, we propose a graph convolutional neural
network (GCN) and find the recovery topology of the USNET in an on-line manner.
Secondly, to cope with general UEDs, we develop a GCN based trajectory planning
algorithm that can make UAVs rebuild the communication connectivity during the
self-healing process. We also design a meta learning scheme to facilitate the
on-line executions of the GCN. Numerical results show that the proposed
algorithms can rebuild the communication connectivity of the USNET more quickly
than the existing algorithms under both one-off UEDs and general UEDs. The
simulation results also show that the meta learning scheme can not only enhance
the performance of the GCN but also reduce the time complexity of the on-line
executions.</span>

for learning about the parameters and structure of a Bayesian network. In
particular, we introduce several assumptions that permit the construction of
likelihoods and parameter priors for a large number of Bayesian-network

of likelihood equivalence, which says that data can not help to discriminate
network structures that encode the same assertions of conditional independence.
We describe the constructions that follow from these assumptions, and also
present a method for directly computing the marginal likelihood of a random
sample with no missing observations. Also, we show how these assumptions lead

fundamental research problem in natural language processing. Explaining human
conversations poses a great challenge as it requires contextual understanding,
planning, inference, and several aspects of reasoning including causal,
temporal, and commonsense reasoning. In this work, we introduce CIDER -- a
manually curated dataset that contains dyadic dialogue explanations in the form
of implicit and explicit knowledge triplets inferred using contextual
commonsense inference. Extracting such rich explanations from conversations can
be conducive to improving several downstream applications. The annotated
triplets are categorized by the type of commonsense knowledge present (e.g.,
causal, conditional, temporal). We set up three different tasks conditioned on
the annotated dataset: Dialogue-level Natural Language Inference, Span
Extraction, and Multi-choice Span Selection. Baseline results obtained with
transformer-based models reveal that the tasks are difficult, paving the way
for promising future research. The dataset and the baseline implementations are

are trained by maximizing an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). To obtain tighter
ELBO and hence better variational approximations, it has been proposed to use
importance sampling to get a lower variance estimate of the evidence. However,
importance sampling is known to perform poorly in high dimensions. While it has
been suggested many times in the literature to use more sophisticated
algorithms such as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and its Sequential
Importance Sampling (SIS) extensions, the potential benefits brought by these
advanced techniques have never been realized for VAE: the AIS estimate cannot
be easily differentiated, while SIS requires the specification of carefully
chosen backward Markov kernels. In this paper, we address both issues and
demonstrate the performance of the resulting Monte Carlo VAEs on a variety of
applications.</span>

                                        <span>The quantification of wave loading on offshore structures and components is a
crucial element in the assessment of their useful remaining life. In many
applications the well-known Morison&#x27;s equation is employed to estimate the
forcing from waves with assumed particle velocities and accelerations. This
paper develops a grey-box modelling approach to improve the predictions of the
force on structural members. A grey-box model intends to exploit the enhanced
predictive capabilities of data-based modelling whilst retaining physical
insight into the behaviour of the system; in the context of the work carried
out here, this can be considered as physics-informed machine learning. There
are a number of possible approaches to establish a grey-box model. This paper
demonstrates two means of combining physics (white box) and data-based (black
box) components; one where the model is a simple summation of the two
components, the second where the white-box prediction is fed into the black box
as an additional input. Here Morison&#x27;s equation is used as the physics-based
component in combination with a data-based Gaussian process NARX - a dynamic
variant of the more well-known Gaussian process regression. Two key challenges
with employing the GP-NARX formulation that are addressed here are the
selection of appropriate lag terms and the proper treatment of uncertainty
propagation within the dynamic GP. The best performing grey-box model, the
residual modelling GP-NARX, was able to achieve a 29.13\% and 5.48\% relative
reduction in NMSE over Morison&#x27;s Equation and a black-box GP-NARX respectively,
alongside significant benefits in extrapolative capabilities of the model, in
circumstances of low dataset coverage.</span>

observed that feature-learning discriminators outperform fixed-kernel
discriminators in terms of the sample quality of the models. We provide
separation results between probability metrics with fixed-kernel and
feature-learning discriminators using the function classes $\mathcal{F}_2$ and
$\mathcal{F}_1$ respectively, which were developed to study overparametrized
two-layer neural networks. In particular, we construct pairs of distributions
over hyper-spheres that can not be discriminated by fixed kernel
$(\mathcal{F}_2)$ integral probability metric (IPM) and Stein discrepancy (SD)
in high dimensions, but that can be discriminated by their feature learning
($\mathcal{F}_1$) counterparts. To further study the separation we provide
links between the $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ IPMs with sliced
Wasserstein distances. Our work suggests that fixed-kernel discriminators
perform worse than their feature learning counterparts because their
corresponding metrics are weaker.</span>

in device wake-up and user interaction on smart devices. However, it is
challenging to minimize errors while operating efficiently in devices with
limited resources such as mobile phones. We present a broadcasted residual
learning method to achieve high accuracy with small model size and
computational load. Our method configures most of the residual functions as 1D
temporal convolution while still allows 2D convolution together using a
broadcasted-residual connection that expands temporal output to
frequency-temporal dimension. This residual mapping enables the network to
effectively represent useful audio features with much less computation than
conventional convolutional neural networks. We also propose a novel network
architecture, Broadcasting-residual network (BC-ResNet), based on broadcasted
residual learning and describe how to scale up the model according to the
target device&#x27;s resources. BC-ResNets achieve state-of-the-art 98.0% and 98.7%
top-1 accuracy on Google speech command datasets v1 and v2, respectively, and
consistently outperform previous approaches, using fewer computations and
parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Robot manipulation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a
challenging problem due to the variety of shapes, materials, arrangements and
lighting conditions. Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust
perception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across
various lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we
propose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.
The underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural
network using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation
masks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as
output. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo
sub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection,
unknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and
significantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor.
By inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can
be used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and
hard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments.
In unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D
network and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects.
However, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent)
objects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust
manipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown
environments.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a benchmark to study surrogate model accuracy for protein-ligand
docking. We share a dataset consisting of 200 million 3D complex structures and
2D structure scores across a consistent set of 13 million &quot;in-stock&quot; molecules
over 15 receptors, or binding sites, across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Our work
shows surrogate docking models have six orders of magnitude more throughput
than standard docking protocols on the same supercomputer node types. We
demonstrate the power of high-speed surrogate models by running each target
against 1 billion molecules in under a day (50k predictions per GPU seconds).
We showcase a workflow for docking utilizing surrogate ML models as a
pre-filter. Our workflow is ten times faster at screening a library of
compounds than the standard technique, with an error rate less than 0.01\% of
detecting the underlying best scoring 0.1\% of compounds. Our analysis of the
speedup explains that to screen more molecules under a docking paradigm,
another order of magnitude speedup must come from model accuracy rather than
computing speed (which, if increased, will not anymore alter our throughput to
screen molecules). We believe this is strong evidence for the community to
begin focusing on improving the accuracy of surrogate models to improve the
ability to screen massive compound libraries 100x or even 1000x faster than
current techniques.</span>

leveraging prior experience, which can be either self-generated or acquired
from other entities. Action advising is a framework that provides a flexible
way to transfer such knowledge in the form of actions between teacher-student
peers. However, due to the realistic concerns, the number of these interactions
is limited with a budget; therefore, it is crucial to perform these in the most
appropriate moments. There have been several promising studies recently that
address this problem setting especially from the student&#x27;s perspective. Despite
their success, they have some shortcomings when it comes to the practical
applicability and integrity as an overall solution to the learning from advice
challenge. In this paper, we extend the idea of advice reusing via teacher
imitation to construct a unified approach that addresses both advice collection
and advice utilisation problems. We also propose a method to automatically tune
the relevant hyperparameters of these components on-the-fly to make it able to
adapt to any task with minimal human intervention. The experiments we performed
in 5 different Atari games verify that our algorithm either surpasses or
performs on-par with its top competitors while being far simpler to be
employed. Furthermore, its individual components are also found to be providing
significant advantages alone.</span>

                                        <span>Machine Learning (ML) has recently been demonstrated to rival expert-level
human accuracy in prediction and detection tasks in a variety of domains,
including medicine. Despite these impressive findings, however, a key barrier
to the full realization of ML&#x27;s potential in medical prognoses is technology
acceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress
in improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer
from limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a
system fails, but do poorly at explaining when and why a model&#x27;s prediction is
correct. We posit that the acceptability of ML predictions in expert domains is
limited by two key factors: the machine&#x27;s horizon of prediction that extends
beyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to
incorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML
architecture, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to enhance human
understanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human
cognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a
distribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this
approach may significantly improve human-machine collaboration in prediction
tasks in expert domains such as medical prognoses. We propose a model and
demonstrate, by expanding a concrete example from the literature, how our model
advances the vision of future hybrid Human-AI systems.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and
their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are &quot;data hungry&quot; and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our model eliminates the requirement
for class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling
strategy and the use of convolutions. We show that compared to CNNs, our
compact transformers have fewer parameters and MACs, while obtaining similar
accuracies. Our method is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as
little as 0.28M parameters and achieve reasonable results. It can reach an
accuracy of 95.29 % when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is comparable
with modern CNN based approaches, and a significant improvement over previous
Transformer based models. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those equipped with basic computing
resources and/or dealing with important small datasets. Our method works on
larger datasets, such as ImageNet (80.28% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT),
and NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available

                                        <span>Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to
predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source
task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been
widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major
challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the
cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this
problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of
transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.
In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score
that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in
OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the
joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal
transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and
label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative
conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the
intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE
score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,
respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability
metrics on average.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a general framework for approximating regular conditional
distributions (RCDs). Our approximations of these RCDs are implemented by a new
class of geometric deep learning models with inputs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and
outputs in the Wasserstein-$1$ space $\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D)$. We find
that the models built using our framework can approximate any continuous
functions from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D)$ uniformly on
compacts, and quantitative rates are obtained. We identify two methods for
avoiding the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;; i.e.: the number of parameters
determining the approximating neural network depends only polynomially on the
involved dimension and the approximation error. The first solution describes
functions in $C(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D))$ which can be
efficiently approximated on any compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Conversely,
the second approach describes sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, on which any function in
$C(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^D))$ can be efficiently approximated.
Our framework is used to obtain an affirmative answer to the open conjecture of
Bishop (1994); namely: mixture density networks are universal regular
conditional distributions. The predictive performance of the proposed models is
evaluated against comparable learning models on various probabilistic
predictions tasks in the context of ELMs, model uncertainty, and
heteroscedastic regression. All the results are obtained for more general input
and output spaces and thus apply to geometric deep learning contexts.</span>

                                        <span>This paper considers data-driven chance-constrained stochastic optimization
problems in a Bayesian framework. Bayesian posteriors afford a principled
mechanism to incorporate data and prior knowledge into stochastic optimization
problems. However, the computation of Bayesian posteriors is typically an
intractable problem, and has spawned a large literature on approximate Bayesian
computation. Here, in the context of chance-constrained optimization, we focus
on the question of statistical consistency (in an appropriate sense) of the
optimal value, computed using an approximate posterior distribution. To this
end, we rigorously prove a frequentist consistency result demonstrating the
convergence of the optimal value to the optimal value of a fixed, parameterized
constrained optimization problem. We augment this by also establishing a
probabilistic rate of convergence of the optimal value. We also prove the
convex feasibility of the approximate Bayesian stochastic optimization problem.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach on an optimal staffing
problem for an M/M/c queueing model.</span>

                                        <span>Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine
learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve
the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning
rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective
adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer
problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic
momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. At the
same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by
using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in
estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated
BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still
achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ without large
batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm
(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our
methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of
adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum
and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence
analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel
optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel
optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.</span>

                                        <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a relatively large number of labeled
nodes and a reliable/uncorrupted graph connectivity structure in order to
obtain good performance on the semi-supervised node classification task. The
performance of GNNs can degrade significantly as the number of labeled nodes
decreases or the graph connectivity structure is corrupted by adversarial
attacks or due to noises in data measurement /collection. Therefore, it is
important to develop GNN models that are able to achieve good performance when
there is limited supervision knowledge -- a few labeled nodes and noisy graph
structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual GNN learning framework to
address this challenge task. The proposed framework has two GNN based node
prediction modules. The primary module uses the input graph structure to induce
regular node embeddings and predictions with a regular GNN baseline, while the
auxiliary module constructs a new graph structure through fine-grained spectral
clusterings and learns new node embeddings and predictions. By integrating the
two modules in a dual GNN learning framework, we perform joint learning in an
end-to-end fashion. This general framework can be applied on many GNN baseline
models. The experimental results validate that the proposed dual GNN framework
can greatly outperform the GNN baseline methods when the labeled nodes are
scarce and the graph connectivity structure is noisy.</span>

without the need for centralizing training data, thereby maintaining data
privacy. Addressing the ability to handle data heterogeneity (non-identical and
independent distribution or non-IID) is a key enabler for the wider deployment

fine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class
variances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by
locating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the
complete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its
strong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image
classification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without
requiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention
mechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the
model&#x27;s capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting

segmenting continuous lung sound recordings into discrete events and performing
recognition on each event. Exploiting the lightweight nature of Temporal
Convolution Networks (TCNs) and their superior results compared to their
recurrent counterparts, we propose a lightweight, yet robust, and completely
interpretable framework for lung sound event detection. We propose the use of a
multi-branch TCN architecture and exploit a novel fusion strategy to combine
the resultant features from these branches. This not only allows the network to
retain the most salient information across different temporal granularities and
disregards irrelevant information, but also allows our network to process
recordings of arbitrary length. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on
multiple public and in-house benchmarks of irregular and noisy recordings of
the respiratory auscultation process for the identification of numerous
auscultation events including inhalation, exhalation, crackles, wheeze,
stridor, and rhonchi. We exceed the state-of-the-art results in all
evaluations. Furthermore, we empirically analyse the effect of the proposed
multi-branch TCN architecture and the feature fusion strategy and provide
quantitative and qualitative evaluations to illustrate their efficiency.
Moreover, we provide an end-to-end model interpretation pipeline that
interprets the operations of all the components of the proposed framework. Our
analysis of different feature fusion strategies shows that the proposed feature
concatenation method leads to better suppression of non-informative features,
which drastically reduces the classifier overhead resulting in a robust
lightweight network.The lightweight nature of our model allows it to be
deployed in end-user devices such as smartphones, and it has the ability to
generate predictions in real-time.</span>

producing realistic-looking images in the computer vision area. Recently,
GAN-based techniques are shown to be promising for spatio-temporal-based
applications such as trajectory prediction, events generation and time-series
data imputation. While several reviews for GANs in computer vision have been
presented, no one has considered addressing the practical applications and
challenges relevant to spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we have conducted a
comprehensive review of the recent developments of GANs for spatio-temporal
data. We summarise the application of popular GAN architectures for
spatio-temporal data and the common practices for evaluating the performance of
spatio-temporal applications with GANs. Finally, we point out future research
directions to benefit researchers in this area.</span>

This study uses a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing flows, to
produce accurate probabilistic forecasts that are crucial for decision-makers
to face the new challenges in power systems applications. Through comprehensive
empirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting

based on the notion of privacy loss random variables to quantify the privacy

approximate the privacy curve of a DP algorithm composed with itself $k$ times

In this work, we demonstrate how calculating the trace, a crucial step in this

processes (GPs) have yet to fully capitalize on developments in computing
hardware. We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on
Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified
batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for
training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity
of exact GP inference from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$. Adapting this algorithm to
scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for
efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In
addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up
convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to
dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations.
Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP
inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.</span>

Hessian for a Riemannian manifold that is a quotient of a manifold embedded in
an inner product space with a non-constant metric function. Together with a
classical formula for projection, this allows us to evaluate Riemannian
gradient and Hessian for several families of metrics on classical manifolds,
including a family of metrics on Stiefel manifolds connecting both the constant
and canonical ambient metrics with closed-form geodesics. Using these formulas,
we derive Riemannian optimization frameworks on quotients of Stiefel manifolds,
including flag manifolds, and a new family of complete quotient metrics on the
manifold of positive-semidefinite matrices of fixed rank, considered as a
quotient of a product of Stiefel and positive-definite matrix manifold with
affine-invariant metrics. The method is procedural, and in many instances, the
Riemannian gradient and Hessian formulas could be derived by symbolic calculus.
The method extends the list of potential metrics that could be used in manifold

multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receive processing. Typical approaches
either augment a single processing step, such as symbol detection, or replace
multiple steps jointly by a single neural network (NN). These techniques
demonstrate promising results but often assume perfect channel state
information (CSI) or fail to satisfy the interpretability and scalability
constraints imposed by practical systems. In this paper, we propose a new
strategy which preserves the benefits of a conventional receiver, but enhances
specific parts with ML components. The key idea is to exploit the orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal structure to improve both the
demapping and the computation of the channel estimation error statistics.
Evaluation results show that the proposed ML-enhanced receiver beats practical
baselines on all considered scenarios, with significant gains at high speeds.</span>

annotations to learn feature representations. For vision tasks, pretext tasks
such as predicting rotation, solving jigsaw are solely created from the input
data. Yet, predicting this known information helps in learning representations
useful for downstream tasks. However, recent works have shown that wider and
deeper models benefit more from self-supervised learning than smaller models.
To address the issue of self-supervised pre-training of smaller models, we
propose Distill-on-the-Go (DoGo), a self-supervised learning paradigm using
single-stage online knowledge distillation to improve the representation
quality of the smaller models. We employ deep mutual learning strategy in which
two models collaboratively learn from each other to improve one another.
Specifically, each model is trained using self-supervised learning along with
distillation that aligns each model&#x27;s softmax probabilities of similarity
scores with that of the peer model. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets, learning objectives, and architectures to

                                        <span>We introduce a new second-order inertial optimization method for machine
learning called INNA. It exploits the geometry of the loss function while only
requiring stochastic approximations of the function values and the generalized
gradients. This makes INNA fully implementable and adapted to large-scale
optimization problems such as the training of deep neural networks. The
algorithm combines both gradient-descent and Newton-like behaviors as well as
inertia. We prove the convergence of INNA for most deep learning problems. To
do so, we provide a well-suited framework to analyze deep learning loss
functions involving tame optimization in which we study a continuous dynamical
system together with its discrete stochastic approximations. We prove sublinear
convergence for the continuous-time differential inclusion which underlies our
algorithm. Additionally, we also show how standard optimization mini-batch
methods applied to non-smooth non-convex problems can yield a certain type of
spurious stationary points never discussed before. We address this issue by
providing a theoretical framework around the new idea of $D$-criticality; we
then give a simple asymptotic analysis of INNA. Our algorithm allows for using
an aggressive learning rate of $o(1/\log k)$. From an empirical viewpoint, we
show that INNA returns competitive results with respect to state of the art
(stochastic gradient descent, ADAGRAD, ADAM) on popular deep learning benchmark
problems.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-goal reinforcement learning is widely applied in planning and robot
manipulation. Two main challenges in multi-goal reinforcement learning are
sparse rewards and sample inefficiency. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) aims
to tackle the two challenges via goal relabeling. However, HER-related works
still need millions of samples and a huge computation. In this paper, we
propose Multi-step Hindsight Experience Replay (MHER), incorporating multi-step
relabeled returns based on $n$-step relabeling to improve sample efficiency.
Despite the advantages of $n$-step relabeling, we theoretically and
experimentally prove the off-policy $n$-step bias introduced by $n$-step
relabeling may lead to poor performance in many environments. To address the
above issue, two bias-reduced MHER algorithms, MHER($\lambda$) and Model-based
MHER (MMHER) are presented. MHER($\lambda$) exploits the $\lambda$ return while
MMHER benefits from model-based value expansions. Experimental results on
numerous multi-goal robotic tasks show that our solutions can successfully
alleviate off-policy $n$-step bias and achieve significantly higher sample
efficiency than HER and Curriculum-guided HER with little additional
computation beyond HER.</span>

machine learning problems. Although multiple adaptive methods were recently
studied, they mainly focus on either empirical or theoretical aspects and also
only work for specific problems by using specific adaptive learning rates. It
is desired to design a universal framework for practical algorithms of adaptive
gradients with theoretical guarantee to solve general problems. To fill this
gap, we propose a faster and universal framework of adaptive gradients (i.e.,
SUPER-ADAM) by introducing a universal adaptive matrix that includes most
existing adaptive gradient forms. Moreover, our framework can flexibly
integrates the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, our
novel framework provides the convergence analysis support for adaptive gradient
methods under the nonconvex setting. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our
new algorithm can achieve the best known complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of
nonconvex optimization, which matches the lower bound for stochastic smooth
nonconvex optimization. In numerical experiments, we employ various deep
learning tasks to validate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
existing adaptive algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Episodic reinforcement learning and contextual bandits are two widely studied
sequential decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement learning
generalizes contextual bandits and is often perceived to be more difficult due
to long planning horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions. The current
paper shows that the long planning horizon and the unknown state-dependent
transitions (at most) pose little additional difficulty on sample complexity.

We consider the episodic reinforcement learning with $S$ states, $A$ actions,
planning horizon $H$, total reward bounded by $1$, and the agent plays for $K$
episodes. We propose a new algorithm, \textbf{M}onotonic \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{P}ropagation (MVP), which relies on a new Bernstein-type bonus.
Compared to existing bonus constructions, the new bonus is tighter since it is
based on a well-designed monotonic value function. In particular, the
\emph{constants} in the bonus should be subtly setting to ensure optimism and
monotonicity.

We show MVP enjoys an $O\left(\left(\sqrt{SAK} + S^2A\right) \poly\log
\left(SAHK\right)\right)$ regret, approaching the
$\Omega\left(\sqrt{SAK}\right)$ lower bound of \emph{contextual bandits} up to
logarithmic terms. Notably, this result 1) \emph{exponentially} improves the
state-of-the-art polynomial-time algorithms by Dann et al. [2019] and Zanette
et al. [2019] in terms of the dependency on $H$, and 2) \emph{exponentially}
improves the running time in [Wang et al. 2020] and significantly improves the
dependency on $S$, $A$ and $K$ in sample complexity.</span>

exploring. Predicting the loan risk can benefit entrepreneurship by developing
more jobs for the society. CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is a powerful
machine learning algorithm suitable for dataset with many categorical variables
like the dataset for forecasting loan risk. In this paper, we identify the
important risk factors that contribute to loan status classification problem.
Then we compare the performance between boosting-type algorithms(especially
CatBoost) with other traditional yet popular ones. The dataset we adopt in the
research comes from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and holds a
very large sample size (899,164 observations and 27 features). In order to make
the best use of the important features in the dataset, we propose a technique
named &quot;synthetic generation&quot; to develop more combined features based on
arithmetic operation, which ends up improving the accuracy and AUC of the
original CatBoost model. We obtain a high accuracy of 95.84% and well-performed
AUC of 98.80% compared with the existent literature of related research.</span>

high-dimensional data with the preservation of essential information. In the
context of manifold learning, we define that the representation after
information-lossless DR preserves the topological and geometric properties of
data manifolds formally, and propose a novel two-stage DR method, called
invertible manifold learning (inv-ML) to bridge the gap between theoretical
information-lossless and practical DR. The first stage includes a homeomorphic
sparse coordinate transformation to learn low-dimensional representations
without destroying topology and a local isometry constraint to preserve local
geometry. In the second stage, a linear compression is implemented for the
trade-off between the target dimension and the incurred information loss in
excessive DR scenarios. Experiments are conducted on seven datasets with a
neural network implementation of inv-ML, called i-ML-Enc. Empirically, i-ML-Enc
achieves invertible DR in comparison with typical existing methods as well as
reveals the characteristics of the learned manifolds. Through latent space
interpolation on real-world datasets, we find that the reliability of tangent
space approximated by the local neighborhood is the key to the success of
manifold-based DR algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning algorithms with empirical risk minimization are vulnerable
under distributional shifts due to the greedy adoption of all the correlations
found in training data. There is an emerging literature on tackling this
problem by minimizing the worst-case risk over an uncertainty set. However,
existing methods mostly construct ambiguity sets by treating all variables
equally regardless of the stability of their correlations with the target,
resulting in the overwhelmingly-large uncertainty set and low confidence of the
learner. In this paper, we propose a novel Stable Adversarial Learning (SAL)
algorithm that leverages heterogeneous data sources to construct a more
practical uncertainty set and conduct differentiated robustness optimization,
where covariates are differentiated according to the stability of their
correlations with the target. We theoretically show that our method is
tractable for stochastic gradient-based optimization and provide the
performance guarantees for our method. Empirical studies on both simulation and
real datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in terms of uniformly
good performance across unknown distributional shifts.</span>

                                        <span>In the online continual learning paradigm, agents must learn from a changing
distribution while respecting memory and compute constraints. Previous work in
this setting often tries to reduce catastrophic forgetting by limiting changes
in the space of model parameters. In this work we instead focus on the change
in representations of observed data that arises when previously unobserved
classes appear in the incoming data stream, and new classes must be
distinguished from previous ones. Starting from a popular approach, experience
replay, we consider metric learning based loss functions which, when adjusted
to appropriately select negative samples, can effectively nudge the learned
representations to be more robust to new future classes. We show that this
selection of negatives is in fact critical for reducing representation drift of
previously observed data. Motivated by this we further introduce a simple
adjustment to the standard cross entropy loss used in prior experience replay
that achieves similar effect. Our approach directly improves the performance of
experience replay for this setting, obtaining state-of-the-art results on
several existing benchmarks in online continual learning, while remaining
efficient in both memory and compute. We release an implementation of our
experiments at https://github.com/naderAsadi/AML</span>

                                        <span>For deep linear networks (DLN), various hyperparameters alter the dynamics of
training dramatically. We investigate how the rank of the linear map found by
gradient descent is affected by (1) the initialization norm and (2) the
addition of $L_{2}$ regularization on the parameters. For (1), we study two
regimes: (1a) the linear/lazy regime, for large norm initialization; (1b) a
\textquotedbl saddle-to-saddle\textquotedbl{} regime for small initialization
norm. In the (1a) setting, the dynamics of a DLN of any depth is similar to
that of a standard linear model, without any low-rank bias. In the (1b)
setting, we conjecture that throughout training, gradient descent approaches a
sequence of saddles, each corresponding to linear maps of increasing rank,
until reaching a minimal rank global minimum. We support this conjecture with a
partial proof and some numerical experiments. For (2), we show that adding a
$L_{2}$ regularization on the parameters corresponds to the addition to the
cost of a $L_{p}$-Schatten (quasi)norm on the linear map with $p&#x3D;\frac{2}{L}$
(for a depth-$L$ network), leading to a stronger low-rank bias as $L$ grows.
The effect of $L_{2}$ regularization on the loss surface depends on the depth:
for shallow networks, all critical points are either strict saddles or global
minima, whereas for deep networks, some local minima appear. We numerically
observe that these local minima can generalize better than global ones in some
settings.</span>

                                        <span>Factorization machine (FM) is a prevalent approach to modeling pairwise
(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into
the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model
arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has
demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

video-data from a wide-angle stereo camera system mounted at an urban
intersection into the forecast of cyclist trajectories. We extract features
from image and optical flow (OF) sequences using 3D convolutional neural
networks (3D-ConvNet) and combine them with features extracted from the
cyclist&#x27;s past trajectory to forecast future cyclist positions. By the use of
additional information, we are able to improve positional accuracy by about 7.5
% for our test dataset and by up to 22 % for specific motion types compared to
a method solely based on past trajectories. Furthermore, we compare the use of
image sequences to the use of OF sequences as additional information, showing
that OF alone leads to significant improvements in positional accuracy. By
training and testing our methods using a real-world dataset recorded at a
heavily frequented public intersection and evaluating the methods&#x27; runtimes, we
demonstrate the applicability in real traffic scenarios. Our code and parts of

a key role in tumor evolution, and yet remains an understudied topic in
computational pathology. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is among the
first to hybrid local and global graph methods to profile orchestration and
interaction of cellular components. To address the challenge in hematolymphoid
cancers where the cell classes in TME are unclear, we first implemented cell
level unsupervised learning and identified two new cell subtypes. Local cell
graphs or supercells were built for each image by considering the individual
cell&#x27;s geospatial location and classes. Then, we applied supercell level
clustering and identified two new cell communities. In the end, we built global
graphs to abstract spatial interaction patterns and extract features for
disease diagnosis. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on H\&amp;E slides of 60
hematolymphoid neoplasm patients and further compared it with three cell level
graph-based algorithms, including the global cell graph, cluster cell graph,
and FLocK. The proposed algorithm achieves a mean diagnosis accuracy of 0.703
with the repeated 5-fold cross-validation scheme. In conclusion, our algorithm
shows superior performance over the existing methods and can be potentially
applied to other cancer types.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer models have achieved great progress on computer vision tasks
recently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by
their high representation ability for extracting informative features from
input images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep
architectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the
depth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between
shortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present
an augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable
parameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational
costs, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant
projection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
brings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers
without obviously increasing their parameters and FLOPs.</span>

a generic multi-scale spectrogram prediction mechanism where the system first
predicts coarser scale mel-spectrograms that capture the suprasegmental

predict finer scale mel-spectrograms capturing fine-grained prosody.

We present details for two specific versions of MSS called Word-level MSS and
Sentence-level MSS where the scales in our system are motivated by the
linguistic units. The Word-level MSS models word, phoneme, and frame-level
spectrograms while Sentence-level MSS models sentence-level spectrogram in

                                        <span>Federated learning enables machine learning algorithms to be trained over a
network of multiple decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange
of local datasets. Successfully deploying federated learning requires ensuring
that agents (e.g., mobile devices) faithfully execute the intended algorithm,
which has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this study, we first
use risk bounds to analyze how the key feature of federated learning,
unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data, affects agents&#x27; incentives to voluntarily
participate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms.

To be more specific, our analysis reveals that agents with less typical data
distributions and relatively more samples are more likely to opt out of or
tamper with federated learning algorithms. To this end, we formulate the first
faithful implementation problem of federated learning and design two faithful
federated learning mechanisms which satisfy economic properties, scalability,
and privacy. Further, the time complexity of computing all agents&#x27; payments in
the number of agents is $\mathcal{O}(1)$. First, we design a Faithful Federated
Learning (FFL) mechanism which approximates the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
payments via an incremental computation. We show that it achieves (probably
approximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and
some other economic properties (such as budget balance). Second, by
partitioning agents into several subsets, we present a scalable VCG mechanism
approximation. We further design a scalable and Differentially Private FFL
(DP-FFL) mechanism, the first differentially private faithful mechanism, that
maintains the economic properties. Our mechanism enables one to make three-way
performance tradeoffs among privacy, the iterations needed, and payment
accuracy loss.</span>

                                        <span>We study whether and how can we model a joint distribution $p(x,z)$ using two
conditional models $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$ that form a cycle. This is motivated
by the observation that deep generative models, in addition to a likelihood
model $p(x|z)$, often also use an inference model $q(z|x)$ for data
representation, but they rely on a usually uninformative prior distribution
$p(z)$ to define a joint distribution, which may render problems like posterior
collapse and manifold mismatch. To explore the possibility to model a joint
distribution using only $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$, we study their compatibility and
determinacy, corresponding to the existence and uniqueness of a joint
distribution whose conditional distributions coincide with them. We develop a
general theory for novel and operable equivalence criteria for compatibility,
and sufficient conditions for determinacy. Based on the theory, we propose the
CyGen framework for cyclic-conditional generative modeling, including methods
to enforce compatibility and use the determined distribution to fit and
generate data. With the prior constraint removed, CyGen better fits data and
captures more representative features, supported by experiments showing better
generation and downstream classification performance.</span>

taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identify
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple
and plug-and-play open set recognition modules that can be attached to
pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for
failure recognition in object recognition tasks. We conduct a thorough
evaluation of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art open set
algorithms, finding that GeMOS either outperforms or is statistically
indistinguishable from more complex and costly models.</span>

Refinement. SR3 adapts denoising diffusion probabilistic models to conditional
image generation and performs super-resolution through a stochastic denoising
process. Inference starts with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively refines the
noisy output using a U-Net model trained on denoising at various noise levels.
SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different
magnification factors, on faces and natural images. We conduct human evaluation
on a standard 8X face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ, comparing with SOTA
GAN methods. SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic
outputs, while GANs do not exceed a fool rate of 34%. We further show the
effectiveness of SR3 in cascaded image generation, where generative models are
chained with super-resolution models, yielding a competitive FID score of 11.3

several assumptions that permit the construction of parameter priors for a
large number of DAG models from a small set of assessments. We then present a
method for directly computing the marginal likelihood of every DAG model given
a random sample with no missing observations. We apply this methodology to
Gaussian DAG models which consist of a recursive set of linear regression
models. We show that the only parameter prior for complete Gaussian DAG models
that satisfies our assumptions is the normal-Wishart distribution. Our analysis
is based on the following new characterization of the Wishart distribution: let
$W$ be an $n \times n$, $n \ge 3$, positive-definite symmetric matrix of random
variables and $f(W)$ be a pdf of $W$. Then, f$(W)$ is a Wishart distribution if
and only if $W_{11} - W_{12} W_{22}^{-1} W&#x27;_{12}$ is independent of
$\{W_{12},W_{22}\}$ for every block partitioning $W_{11},W_{12}, W&#x27;_{12},

missing data imputation has become an active research area, in which recent

DAEMA (Denoising Autoencoder with Mask Attention), an algorithm based on a

imputation algorithms use incomplete inputs as they would use complete data -
up to basic preprocessing (e.g. mean imputation) - DAEMA leverages a mask-based
attention mechanism to focus on the observed values of its inputs. We evaluate
DAEMA both in terms of reconstruction capabilities and downstream prediction
and show that it achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art algorithms
on several publicly available real-world datasets under various missingness

                                        <span>Graph signal processing is a ubiquitous task in many applications such as
sensor, social, transportation and brain networks, point cloud processing, and
graph neural networks. Graph signals are often corrupted through sensing
processes, and need to be restored for the above applications. In this paper,
we propose two graph signal restoration methods based on deep algorithm
unrolling (DAU). First, we present a graph signal denoiser by unrolling
iterations of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We then
propose a general restoration method for linear degradation by unrolling
iterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In the second method, the unrolled
ADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a submodule. Therefore, our restoration
method has a nested DAU structure. Thanks to DAU, parameters in the proposed
denoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Since the
proposed restoration methods are based on iterations of a (convex) optimization
algorithm, the method is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small
because we only need to tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We
solve two main problems in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1)
limited performance of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters
which are often determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph
neural networks that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for
graph signal denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and
real-world data. The proposed methods show performance improvements to several
existing methods in terms of root mean squared error in both tasks.</span>

being one of the models for human and machine learning introduced by
E.~M.~Gold, is investigated. Particularly, naturally arising questions about
this learning setting, originating in results on learning from solely positive
information, are answered. By a carefully arranged argument learners can be
assumed to only change their hypothesis in case it is inconsistent with the
data (such a learning behavior is called \emph{conservative}). The deduced main
theorem states the relations between the most important delayable learning
success criteria, being the ones not ruined by a delayed in time hypothesis
output. Additionally, our investigations concerning the non-delayable
requirement of consistent learning underpin the claim for \emph{delayability}
being the right structural property to gain a deeper understanding concerning
the nature of learning success criteria. Moreover, we obtain an anomalous
\emph{hierarchy} when allowing for an increasing finite number of
\emph{anomalies} of the hypothesized language by the learner compared with the
language to be learned. In contrast to the vacillatory hierarchy for learning
from solely positive information, we observe a \emph{duality} depending on
whether infinitely many \emph{vacillations} between different (almost) correct
hypotheses are still considered a successful learning behavior.</span>

                                        <span>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying
deep learning models in an open-world setting. However, existing OOD detection
solutions can be brittle in the open world, facing various types of adversarial
OOD inputs. While methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data have emerged, our
analysis on illuminative examples reveals a key insight that the majority of
auxiliary OOD examples may not meaningfully improve or even hurt the decision
boundary of the OOD detector, which is also observed in empirical results on
real data. In this paper, we provide a theoretically motivated method,
Adversarial Training with informative Outlier Mining (ATOM), which improves the
robustness of OOD detection. We show that, by mining informative auxiliary OOD
data, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance, and somewhat
surprisingly, generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance under a broad family of classic and adversarial
OOD evaluation tasks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 in-distribution dataset,
ATOM reduces the FPR (at TPR 95%) by up to 57.99% under adversarial OOD inputs,
surpassing the previous best baseline by a large margin.</span>

                                        <span>Recent works demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can decrease the victim&#x27;s total reward
by manipulating the observations. Compared with adversarial attacks in
supervised learning, it is much more challenging to deceive a DRL model since
the adversary has to infer the environmental dynamics. To address this issue,
we reformulate the problem of adversarial attacks in function space and
separate the previous gradient based attacks into several subspace. Following
the analysis of the function space, we design a generic two-stage framework in
the subspace where the adversary lures the agent to a target trajectory or a
deceptive policy. In the first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking
the environment, and discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest
reward. The adversary then misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive policy
by perturbing the observations. Our method provides a tighter theoretical upper
bound for the attacked agent&#x27;s performance than the existing approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and we achieve
the state-of-the-art performance on both Atari and MuJoCo environments.</span>

                                        <span>Hash coding has been widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for
large-scale image retrieval. Given semantic annotations such as class labels
and pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and
generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images
may contain undefined semantic labels, which we call unseen images, zeor-shot
hashing techniques have been studied. However, existing zeor-shot hashing
methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle
multi-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive
zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In
order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge
is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then,
pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for
training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data.
Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that,
the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the
competing methods.</span>

However, existing group testing methods are oblivious to the circumstances of
contagion provided by contact tracing. Here, we build upon a well-known
semi-adaptive pool testing method, Dorfman&#x27;s method with imperfect tests, and
derive a simple group testing method based on dynamic programming that is
specifically designed to use the information provided by contact tracing.
Experiments using a variety of reproduction numbers and dispersion levels,
including those estimated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, show that
the pools found using our method result in a significantly lower number of
tests than those found using standard Dorfman&#x27;s method, especially when the
number of contacts of an infected individual is small. Moreover, our results
show that our method can be more beneficial when the secondary infections are
highly overdispersed.</span>

                                        <span>The standard problem setting in Dec-POMDPs is self-play, where the goal is to
find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through
self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step
reasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents&#x27; actions and thus
fail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To
address this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents
follow a policy $\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a
given, fixed policy ($\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken
by $\pi_1$. When $\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy
that does not rely on inferences based on other agents&#x27; behavior (an optimal
grounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy
from one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level
cognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which
may converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,
making it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC). OBL can be scaled to
high-dimensional settings with a fictitious transition mechanism and shows
strong performance in both a toy-setting and the benchmark human-AI &amp; ZSC
problem Hanabi.</span>

statistical language models are impressive not only for their performance, but
also - and quite crucially - because they are built entirely from correlations
in unstructured text data. The latter observation prompts a fundamental
question that lies at the heart of this paper: What mathematical structure
exists in unstructured text data? We put forth enriched category theory as a
natural answer. We show that sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet, such
as those found in a corpus of text, form a category enriched over
probabilities. We then address a second fundamental question: How can this
information be stored and modeled in a way that preserves the categorical
structure? We answer this by constructing a functor from our enriched category
of text to a particular enriched category of reduced density operators. The
latter leverages the Loewner order on positive semidefinite operators, which
can further be interpreted as a toy example of entailment.</span>

                                        <span>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably the most popular
meta-learning algorithm nowadays, given its flexibility to incorporate various
model architectures and to be applied to different problems. Nevertheless, its
performance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms
dedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how
to train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that a large
number of gradient steps are needed for the inner loop update, which
contradicts the common usage of MAML for few-shot classification. Second, we
find that MAML is sensitive to the permutation of class assignments in
meta-testing: for a few-shot task of $N$ classes, there are exponentially many
ways to assign the learned initialization of the $N$-way classifier to the $N$
classes, leading to an unavoidably huge variance. Third, we investigate several
ways for permutation invariance and find that learning a shared classifier
initialization for all the classes performs the best. On benchmark datasets
such as MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name
UNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms, while keeping the simplicity of MAML without adding any extra
sub-networks.</span>

                                        <span>Studying neural network loss landscapes provides insights into the nature of
the underlying optimization problems. Unfortunately, loss landscapes are
notoriously difficult to visualize in a human-comprehensible fashion. One
common way to address this problem is to plot linear slices of the landscape,
for example from the initial state of the network to the final state after
optimization. On the basis of this analysis, prior work has drawn broader
conclusions about the difficulty of the optimization problem. In this paper, we
put inferences of this kind to the test, systematically evaluating how linear
interpolation and final performance vary when altering the data, choice of
initialization, and other optimizer and architecture design choices. Further,
we use linear interpolation to study the role played by individual layers and
substructures of the network. We find that certain layers are more sensitive to
the choice of initialization and optimizer hyperparameter settings, and we
exploit these observations to design custom optimization schemes. However, our
results cast doubt on the broader intuition that the presence or absence of
barriers when interpolating necessarily relates to the success of optimization.</span>

rotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. This is
often attributed to biases in the training dataset, and the lack of 2D
shift-invariance due to not respecting the sampling theorem. In this paper, we
challenge this hypothesis by training and testing on unbiased datasets, and
showing that networks are brittle to both small 3D perspective changes and
lighting variations which cannot be explained by dataset bias or lack of
shift-invariance. To find these in-distribution errors, we introduce an
evolution strategies (ES) based approach, which we call CMA-Search. Despite
training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera
and light variations, in over 71% cases CMA-Search can find camera parameters
in the vicinity of a correctly classified image which lead to in-distribution
misclassifications with &lt; 3.6% change in parameters. With lighting changes,
CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 33% cases with &lt; 11.6% change in
parameters. Finally, we extend this method to find misclassifications in the
vicinity of ImageNet images for both ResNet and OpenAI&#x27;s CLIP model.</span>

extremely efficient method for one-class classification. Our method is based on
a simple idea of transforming the training data by projecting it onto a set of
random unit vectors that are chosen uniformly and independently from the unit
sphere, and bounding the regions based on separation of the data. FROCC can be
naturally extended with kernels. We theoretically prove that FROCC generalizes
well in the sense that it is stable and has low bias. FROCC achieves up to 3.1
percent points better ROC, with 1.2--67.8x speedup in training and test times

                                        <span>Online metric learning has been widely exploited for large-scale data
classification due to the low computational cost. However, amongst online
practical scenarios where the features are evolving (e.g., some features are
vanished and some new features are augmented), most metric learning models
cannot be successfully applied to these scenarios, although they can tackle the
evolving instances efficiently. To address the challenge, we develop a new
online Evolving Metric Learning (EML) model for incremental and decremental
features, which can handle the instance and feature evolutions simultaneously
by incorporating with a smoothed Wasserstein metric distance. Specifically, our
model contains two essential stages: a Transforming stage (T-stage) and a
Inheriting stage (I-stage). For the T-stage, we propose to extract important
information from vanished features while neglecting non-informative knowledge,
and forward it into survived features by transforming them into a low-rank
discriminative metric space. It further explores the intrinsic low-rank
structure of heterogeneous samples to reduce the computation and memory burden
especially for highly-dimensional large-scale data. For the I-stage, we inherit
the metric performance of survived features from the T-stage and then expand to
include the new augmented features. Moreover, a smoothed Wasserstein distance
is utilized to characterize the similarity relationships among the
heterogeneous and complex samples, since the evolving features are not strictly
aligned in the different stages. In addition to tackling the challenges in
one-shot case, we also extend our model into multishot scenario. After deriving
an efficient optimization strategy for both T-stage and I-stage, extensive
experiments on several datasets verify the superior performance of our EML
model.</span>

                                        <span>Dimension is an inherent bottleneck to some modern learning tasks, where
optimization methods suffer from the size of the data. In this paper, we study
non-isotropic distributions of data and develop tools that aim at reducing
these dimensional costs by a dependency on an effective dimension rather than
the ambient one. Based on non-asymptotic estimates of the metric entropy of
ellipsoids -- that prove to generalize to infinite dimensions -- and on a
chaining argument, our uniform concentration bounds involve an effective
dimension instead of the global dimension, improving over existing results. We
show the importance of taking advantage of non-isotropic properties in learning
problems with the following applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art
results in statistical preconditioning for communication-efficient distributed
optimization, ii) we introduce a non-isotropic randomized smoothing for
non-smooth optimization. Both applications cover a class of functions that
encompasses empirical risk minization (ERM) for linear models.</span>

                                        <span>Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to evasion attacks. Evasion
accuracy is typically assessed using aggregate evasion rate, and it is an open
question whether aggregate evasion rate enables feature-level diagnosis on the
effect of adversarial perturbations on evasive predictions. In this paper, we
introduce a novel framework that harnesses explainable ML methods to guide
high-fidelity assessment of ML evasion attacks. Our framework enables
explanation-guided correlation analysis between pre-evasion perturbations and
post-evasion explanations. Towards systematic assessment of ML evasion attacks,
we propose and evaluate a novel suite of model-agnostic metrics for
sample-level and dataset-level correlation analysis. Using malware and image
classifiers, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse model
architectures and complementary feature representations. Our explanation-guided
correlation analysis reveals correlation gaps between adversarial samples and
the corresponding perturbations performed on them. Using a case study on
explanation-guided evasion, we show the broader usage of our methodology for
assessing robustness of ML models.</span>

                                        <span>Graphs are a common model for complex relational data such as social networks
and protein interactions, and such data can evolve over time (e.g., new
friendships) and be noisy (e.g., unmeasured interactions). Link prediction aims
to predict future edges or infer missing edges in the graph, and has diverse
applications in recommender systems, experimental design, and complex systems.
Even though link prediction algorithms strongly depend on the set of edges in
the graph, existing approaches typically do not modify the graph topology to
improve performance. Here, we demonstrate how simply adding a set of edges,
which we call a \emph{proposal set}, to the graph as a pre-processing step can
improve the performance of several link prediction algorithms. The underlying
idea is that if the edges in the proposal set generally align with the
structure of the graph, link prediction algorithms are further guided towards
predicting the right edges; in other words, adding a proposal set of edges is a
signal-boosting pre-processing step. We show how to use existing link
prediction algorithms to generate effective proposal sets and evaluate this
approach on various synthetic and empirical datasets. We find that proposal
sets meaningfully improve the accuracy of link prediction algorithms based on
both neighborhood heuristics and graph neural networks. Code is available at

from vast amounts of data, and synthesize media that is nearly
indistinguishable from the real thing. However, positive tools can also be used
for negative purposes. In particular, cyber adversaries can use AI (such as
machine learning) to enhance their attacks and expand their campaigns.

Although offensive AI has been discussed in the past, there is a need to
analyze and understand the threat in the context of organizations. For example,
how does an AI-capable adversary impact the cyber kill chain? Does AI benefit
the attacker more than the defender? What are the most significant AI threats
facing organizations today and what will be their impact on the future?

In this survey, we explore the threat of offensive AI on organizations.
First, we present the background and discuss how AI changes the adversary&#x27;s
methods, strategies, goals, and overall attack model. Then, through a
literature review, we identify 33 offensive AI capabilities which adversaries
can use to enhance their attacks. Finally, through a user study spanning
industry and academia, we rank the AI threats and provide insights on the
adversaries.</span>

                                        <span>Remaining useful life prediction (RUL) is one of the key technologies of
condition-based maintenance, which is important to maintain the reliability and
safety of industrial equipments. While deep learning has achieved great success
in RUL prediction, existing methods have difficulties in processing long
sequences and extracting information from the sensor and time step aspects. In
this paper, we propose Dual Aspect Self-attention based on Transformer (DAST),
a novel deep RUL prediction method. DAST consists of two encoders, which work
in parallel to simultaneously extract features of different sensors and time
steps. Solely based on self-attention, the DAST encoders are more effective in
processing long data sequences, and are capable of adaptively learning to focus
on more important parts of input. Moreover, the parallel feature extraction
design avoids mutual influence of information from two aspects. Experimental
results on two real turbofan engine datasets show that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</span>

inference. An ideal model should be able to concisely approximate any
probability, while being also compatible with two main operations:
multiplications of two models (product rule) and marginalization with respect

they enjoy strong theoretical guarantees. Moreover, we show that we can perform

scientific machine learning. One key problem is the reconciliation between
modern data-driven approaches and first principles. Despite rapid advances in
machine learning techniques, embedding domain knowledge into data-driven models
remains a challenge. In this work, we present a universal learning framework
for extracting predictive models from nonlinear systems based on observations.
Our framework can readily incorporate first principle knowledge because it
naturally models nonlinear systems as continuous-time systems. This both
improves the extracted models&#x27; extrapolation power and reduces the amount of
data needed for training. In addition, our framework has the advantages of
robustness to observational noise and applicability to irregularly sampled
data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by learning predictive
models for a wide variety of systems including a stiff Van der Pol oscillator,
the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. For the Lorenz
system, different types of domain knowledge are incorporated to demonstrate the
strength of knowledge embedding in data-driven system identification.</span>

underlying dynamics of a system, yet it is generally infeasible to find them
from large-scale data without any prior knowledge or human insight. We propose
ConservNet to achieve this goal, a neural network that spontaneously discovers
a conserved quantity from grouped data where the members of each group share
invariants, similar to a general experimental setting where trajectories from
different trials are observed. As a neural network trained with a novel and
intuitive loss function called noise-variance loss, ConservNet learns the
hidden invariants in each group of multi-dimensional observables in a
data-driven, end-to-end manner. Our model successfully discovers underlying
invariants from the simulated systems having invariants as well as a real-world
double pendulum trajectory. Since the model is robust to various noises and
data conditions compared to baseline, our approach is directly applicable to
experimental data for discovering hidden conservation laws and further, general
relationships between variables.</span>

autoencoders (VAEs) offer scalable amortized posterior inference and fast
sampling. However, VAEs are also more and more outperformed by competing models
such as normalizing flows (NFs), deep-energy models, or the new denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). In this preliminary work, we improve
VAEs by demonstrating how DDPMs can be used for modelling the prior
distribution of the latent variables. The diffusion prior model improves upon
Gaussian priors of classical VAEs and is competitive with NF-based priors.
Finally, we hypothesize that hierarchical VAEs could similarly benefit from the
enhanced capacity of diffusion priors.</span>

provide relationships between some, but not all, factors relevant to AD. We

using RL to optimize an objective (reward) function that captures the above

level using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for
generating waveforms, similar to wavenet \cite{oord2016wavenet}. This is fully
probabilistic, auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends
only on the previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used
wavenet architecture by up to 9\% on a similar dataset for predicting the next
step. Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which
audio samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show
how causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform
synthesis. We also show that this performance can be improved by another 2\% by
conditioning samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model
to synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of
potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer
architectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from
generating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid
the generation process.</span>

wireless networks thanks to its efficient handling of multipath environment.
However, it suffers from a poor peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which
requires a large power backoff, degrading the power amplifier (PA) efficiency.
In this work, we propose to use a neural network (NN) at the transmitter to
learn a high-dimensional modulation scheme allowing to control the PAPR and
adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). On the receiver side, a NN-based
receiver is implemented to carry out demapping of the transmitted bits. The two
NNs operate on top of OFDM, and are jointly optimized in and end-to-end manner
using a training algorithm that enforces constraints on the PAPR and ACLR.
Simulation results show that the learned waveforms enable higher information

                                        <span>Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems represent a promising approach to
increase the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems. However,
near-optimal solutions require a large amount of signaling exchange between
access points (APs) and the network controller (NC). In addition, the use of
hybrid beamforming in each AP reduces the number of power hungry RF chains, but
imposes a large computational complexity to find near-optimal precoders. In
this letter, we propose two unsupervised deep neural networks (DNN)
architectures, fully and partially distributed, that can perform coordinated
hybrid beamforming with zero or limited communication overhead between APs and
NC, while achieving near-optimal sum-rate with a reduced computational
complexity compared to conventional near-optimal solutions.</span>

forecasting power of government yield spread models during distressed periods
even after controlling for the number of negative words present in the text. In
addition, stronger negative emotions, such as panic, reveal useful information
for predicting changes in spread at the short-term horizon, while milder
emotions, such as distress, are useful at longer time horizons. Emotions
generated by the Italian political turmoil propagate to the Spanish news

one-hidden-layer sparse networks. We first consider sparse networks with linear

                                        <span>Anomaly detection is a widely explored domain in machine learning. Many
models are proposed in the literature, and compared through different metrics
measured on various datasets. The most popular metrics used to compare
performances are F1-score, AUC and AVPR. In this paper, we show that F1-score
and AVPR are highly sensitive to the contamination rate. One consequence is
that it is possible to artificially increase their values by modifying the
train-test split procedure. This leads to misleading comparisons between
algorithms in the literature, especially when the evaluation protocol is not
well detailed. Moreover, we show that the F1-score and the AVPR cannot be used
to compare performances on different datasets as they do not reflect the
intrinsic difficulty of modeling such data. Based on these observations, we
claim that F1-score and AVPR should not be used as metrics for anomaly
detection. We recommend a generic evaluation procedure for unsupervised anomaly
detection, including the use of other metrics such as the AUC, which are more
robust to arbitrary choices in the evaluation protocol.</span>

strong ability to recognize outliers and defend adversaries. The basic idea is
to change the autoencoder from an unsupervised learning method into a
classifier. The CAE is a modified autoencoder, where the encoder is used to
compress samples with different labels into disjoint compression spaces and the
decoder is used to recover a sample with a given label from the corresponding
compression space. The encoder is used as a classifier and the decoder is used
to decide whether the classification given by the encoder is correct by
comparing the input sample with the output. Since adversary samples are seeming
inevitable for the current DNN framework, we introduce the list classification
based on CAE to defend adversaries, which outputs several labels and the
corresponding samples recovered by the CAE. The CAE is evaluated using the
MNIST dataset in great detail. It is shown that the CAE network can recognize
almost all outliers and the list classification contains the correct label for
almost all adversaries.</span>

semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To
counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is
known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the
Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks.
Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such
single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training.
Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of
single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we
address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic
segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the
robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not
increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training
considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of
meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with
multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic
segmentation.</span>

world, where training and test samples share the same label space. In this
paper, we target a more challenging and realistic setting: open-set learning
(OSL), where there exist test samples from the classes that are unseen during
training. Although researchers have designed many methods from the algorithmic
perspectives, there are few methods that provide generalization guarantees on
their ability to achieve consistent performance on different training samples
drawn from the same distribution. Motivated by the transfer learning and
probably approximate correct (PAC) theory, we make a bold attempt to study OSL
by proving its generalization error-given training samples with size n, the
estimation error will get close to order O_p(1/\sqrt{n}). This is the first
study to provide a generalization bound for OSL, which we do by theoretically
investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. According
to our theory, a novel algorithm, called auxiliary open-set risk (AOSR) is
proposed to address the OSL problem. Experiments verify the efficacy of AOSR.

                                        <span>Motivated by graph theory, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
traditionally structured as layers of neurons (nodes), which learn useful
information by the passage of data through interconnections (edges). In the
machine learning realm, graph structures (i.e., neurons and connections) of
ANNs have recently been explored using various graph-theoretic measures linked
to their predictive performance. On the other hand, in network science
(NetSci), certain graph measures including entropy and curvature are known to
provide insight into the robustness and fragility of real-world networks. In
this work, we use these graph measures to explore the robustness of various
ANNs to adversarial attacks. To this end, we (1) explore the design space of
inter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes of ANNs in the graph domain
and record their predictive performance after training under different types of
adversarial attacks, (2) use graph representations for both inter-layer and
intra-layers connectivity regimes to calculate various graph-theoretic
measures, including curvature and entropy, and (3) analyze the relationship
between these graph measures and the adversarial performance of ANNs. We show
that curvature and entropy, while operating in the graph domain, can quantify
the robustness of ANNs without having to train these ANNs. Our results suggest
that the real-world networks, including brain networks, financial networks, and
social networks may provide important clues to the neural architecture search
for robust ANNs. We propose a search strategy that efficiently finds robust
ANNs amongst a set of well-performing ANNs without having a need to train all
of these ANNs.</span>

on out-of-distribution data, accuracies on in- versus out-of-distribution data
are widely observed to follow a single linear trend when evaluated across a
testbed of models. Models that are more accurate on the out-of-distribution
data relative to this baseline exhibit &quot;effective robustness&quot; and are
exceedingly rare. Identifying such models, and understanding their properties,
is key to improving out-of-distribution performance. We conduct a thorough
empirical investigation of effective robustness during fine-tuning and
surprisingly find that models pre-trained on larger datasets exhibit effective
robustness during training that vanishes at convergence. We study how
properties of the data influence effective robustness, and we show that it
increases with the larger size, more diversity, and higher example difficulty
of the dataset. We also find that models that display effective robustness are
able to correctly classify 10% of the examples that no other current testbed
model gets correct. Finally, we discuss several strategies for scaling
effective robustness to the high-accuracy regime to improve the
out-of-distribution accuracy of state-of-the-art models.</span>

methods for solving the nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems by using
unified adaptive matrices used in the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}.
Specifically, we propose a fast adaptive gradient decent ascent (AdaGDA) method
based on the basic momentum technique, which reaches a low sample complexity of
$O(\kappa^4\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without
large batches, which improves the existing result of adaptive minimax
optimization method by a factor of $O(\sqrt{\kappa})$. Moreover, we present an
accelerated version of AdaGDA (VR-AdaGDA) method based on the momentum-based
variance reduced technique, which achieves the best known sample complexity of
$O(\kappa^3\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without
large batches. Further assume the bounded Lipschitz parameter of objective
function, we prove that our VR-AdaGDA method reaches a lower sample complexity
of $O(\kappa^{2.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ with the mini-batch size $O(\kappa)$. In
particular, we provide an effective convergence analysis framework for our

                                        <span>Stochastic Approximation (SA) is a popular approach for solving fixed-point
equations where the information is corrupted by noise. In this paper, we
consider an SA involving a contraction mapping with respect to an arbitrary
norm, and show its finite-sample error bounds while using different stepsizes.
The idea is to construct a smooth Lyapunov function using the generalized
Moreau envelope, and show that the iterates of SA have negative drift with
respect to that Lyapunov function. Our result is applicable in Reinforcement
Learning (RL). In particular, we use it to establish the first-known
convergence rate of the V-trace algorithm for off-policy TD-learning. Moreover,
we also use it to study TD-learning in the on-policy setting, and recover the
existing state-of-the-art results for $Q$-learning. Importantly, our
construction results in only a logarithmic dependence of the convergence bound
on the size of the state-space.</span>

robustness of trained models, where data being less/more vulnerable to the
given attack are assigned smaller/larger weights during training. However, when
tested on attacks different from the given attack simulated in training, the
robustness may drop significantly (e.g., even worse than no reweighting). In
this paper, we study this problem and propose our solution--locally reweighted
adversarial training (LRAT). The rationale behind IRAT is that we do not need
to pay much attention to an instance that is already safe under the attack. We
argue that the safeness should be attack-dependent, so that for the same
instance, its weight can change given different attacks based on the same
model. Thus, if the attack simulated in training is mis-specified, the weights
of IRAT are misleading. To this end, LRAT pairs each instance with its
adversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while
performing no global reweighting--the rationale is to fit the instance itself
if it is immune to the attack, but not to skip the pair, in order to passively
defend different attacks in future. Experiments show that LRAT works better
than both IRAT (i.e., global reweighting) and the standard AT (i.e., no
reweighting) when trained with an attack and tested on different attacks.</span>

decay may improve neural network training, some recent works show their joint
usage may cause instabilities at the late stages of training. Other works, in
contrast, show convergence to the equilibrium, i.e., the stabilization of
training metrics. In this paper, we study this contradiction and show that
instead of converging to a stable equilibrium, the training dynamics converge
to consistent periodic behavior. That is, the training process regularly
exhibits instabilities which, however, do not lead to complete training
failure, but cause a new period of training. We rigorously investigate the
mechanism underlying this discovered periodic behavior both from an empirical
and theoretical point of view and show that this periodic behavior is indeed
caused by the interaction between batch normalization and weight decay.</span>

                                        <span>The memorization effect of deep neural network (DNN) plays a pivotal role in
many state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property,
the early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of
training, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early
stopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be
considered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter
layers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former
counterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the
whole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each
other, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to
separate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address
this problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at
once, we initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a
relatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the
latter DNN layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers
fixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as
progressive early stopping (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the
early stopping, PES can help to obtain more promising and stable results.
Furthermore, by combining PES with existing approaches on noisy label training,
we achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks.</span>

number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled
source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods
assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which
ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple
source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster
R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which
can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power.
Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo
target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to
conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features,
respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second,
we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal
parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in
different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region
proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract
invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in
representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node
embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing
information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work
has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a
graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well
as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for
discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to
the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a
novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph
Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a
hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message
passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge
representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain
holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation
learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph
representation and generation performance, on which our method largely
outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge
representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms
state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only
because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its
lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective
message passing.</span>

Network-aware HN-PFL, where we optimize a tradeoff between energy consumption

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many graph-based
tasks. Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with the adaptive locality
ability, which enables measuring the importance of neighboring nodes to the
target node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific
mechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the
topology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring
nodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we
introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the
strength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature
Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality
ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To
improve the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly
transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary
Negative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then,
we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN
effectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is
improved significantly. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node
classification benchmark datasets. This study deepens the understanding of how
to utilize advanced topology information and assign the importance of
neighboring nodes from the perspective of graph curvature and encourages us to
bridge the gap between graph theory and neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>We investigate a correspondence between two formalisms for discrete
probabilistic modeling: probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and tensor
networks (TNs), a powerful modeling framework for simulating complex quantum
systems. The graphical calculus of PGMs and TNs exhibits many similarities,
with discrete undirected graphical models (UGMs) being a special case of TNs.
However, more general probabilistic TN models such as Born machines (BMs)
employ complex-valued hidden states to produce novel forms of correlation among
the probabilities. While representing a new modeling resource for capturing
structure in discrete probability distributions, this behavior also renders the
direct application of standard PGM tools impossible. We aim to bridge this gap
by introducing a hybrid PGM-TN formalism that integrates quantum-like
correlations into PGM models in a principled manner, using the
physically-motivated concept of decoherence. We first prove that applying
decoherence to the entirety of a BM model converts it into a discrete UGM, and
conversely, that any subgraph of a discrete UGM can be represented as a
decohered BM. This method allows a broad family of probabilistic TN models to
be encoded as partially decohered BMs, a fact we leverage to combine the
representational strengths of both model families. We experimentally verify the
performance of such hybrid models in a sequential modeling task, and identify
promising uses of our method within the context of existing applications of
graphical models.</span>

graphs. We generalize a previously known distance measure on graphs (Graph
Diffusion Distance), thereby allowing it to be tuned to minimize an arbitrary
loss function. Because all steps involved in calculating this modified GDD are
differentiable, we demonstrate that it is possible for a small neural network
model to learn edge weights which minimize loss. GDD alone does not effectively
discriminate between graphs constructed from shoot apical meristem images of
wild-type vs. mutant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} specimens. However, training
edge weights and kernel parameters with contrastive loss produces a learned
distance metric with large margins between these graph categories. We
demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple
k-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also
demonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis:
once trained, we use our model to compute the distance between the biological
graphs and a set of graphs output by a cell division simulator. This allows us
to identify simulation parameter regimes which are similar to each class of
graph in our original dataset.</span>

                                        <span>We study the selective learning problem introduced by Qiao and Valiant
(2019), in which the learner observes $n$ labeled data points one at a time. At
a time of its choosing, the learner selects a window length $w$ and a model
$\hat\ell$ from the model class $\mathcal{L}$, and then labels the next $w$
data points using $\hat\ell$. The excess risk incurred by the learner is
defined as the difference between the average loss of $\hat\ell$ over those $w$
data points and the smallest possible average loss among all models in
$\mathcal{L}$ over those $w$ data points.

We give an improved algorithm, termed the hybrid exponential weights
algorithm, that achieves an expected excess risk of $O((\log\log|\mathcal{L}| +
\log\log n)/\log n)$. This result gives a doubly exponential improvement in the
dependence on $|\mathcal{L}|$ over the best known bound of
$O(\sqrt{|\mathcal{L}|/\log n})$. We complement the positive result with an
almost matching lower bound, which suggests the worst-case optimality of the
algorithm.

We also study a more restrictive family of learning algorithms that are
bounded-recall in the sense that when a prediction window of length $w$ is
chosen, the learner&#x27;s decision only depends on the most recent $w$ data points.
We analyze an exponential weights variant of the ERM algorithm in Qiao and
Valiant (2019). This new algorithm achieves an expected excess risk of
$O(\sqrt{\log |\mathcal{L}|/\log n})$, which is shown to be nearly optimal
among all bounded-recall learners. Our analysis builds on a generalized version
of the selective mean prediction problem in Drucker (2013); Qiao and Valiant
(2019), which may be of independent interest.</span>

                                        <span>When a deep learning model is deployed in the wild, it can encounter test
data drawn from distributions different from the training data distribution and
suffer drop in performance. For safe deployment, it is essential to estimate
the accuracy of the pre-trained model on the test data. However, the labels for
the test inputs are usually not immediately available in practice, and
obtaining them can be expensive. This observation leads to two challenging
tasks: (1) unsupervised accuracy estimation, which aims to estimate the
accuracy of a pre-trained classifier on a set of unlabeled test inputs; (2)
error detection, which aims to identify mis-classified test inputs. In this
paper, we propose a principled and practically effective framework that
simultaneously addresses the two tasks. The proposed framework iteratively
learns an ensemble of models to identify mis-classified data points and
performs self-training to improve the ensemble with the identified points.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our framework enjoys provable guarantees
for both accuracy estimation and error detection under mild conditions readily
satisfied by practical deep learning models. Along with the framework, we
proposed and experimented with two instantiations and achieved state-of-the-art
results on 59 tasks. For example, on iWildCam, one instantiation reduces the
estimation error for unsupervised accuracy estimation by at least 70% and
improves the F1 score for error detection by at least 4.7% compared to existing
methods.</span>

                                        <span>This paper surveys the field of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. The
combination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has gained
increased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from
single-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is
inherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on the joint actions
of multiple players and (b) the computational complexity of functions
increases. We present the most common multiagent problem representations and
their main challenges, and identify five research areas that address one or
more of these challenges: centralised training and decentralised execution,
opponent modelling, communication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping.
We find that many computational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are
not generalisable to other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of
dimensionality or nonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology
capture promising relevant behaviours such as communication and coordination.
We suggest that, for multiagent reinforcement learning to be successful, future
research addresses these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach to open
up new possibilities for more human-oriented solutions in multiagent
reinforcement learning.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years there has been a special interest in word embeddings as a new
approach to convert words to vectors. It has been a focal point to understand
how much of the semantics of the the words has been transferred into embedding
vectors. This is important as the embedding is going to be used as the basis
for downstream NLP applications and it will be costly to evaluate the
application end-to-end in order to identify quality of the used embedding
model. Generally the word embeddings are evaluated through a number of tests,
including analogy test. In this paper we propose a test framework for Persian
embedding models. Persian is a low resource language and there is no rich
semantic benchmark to evaluate word embedding models for this language. In this
paper we introduce an evaluation framework including a hand crafted Persian SAT
based analogy dataset, a colliquial test set (specific to Persian) and a
benchmark to study the impact of various parameters on the semantic evaluation
task.</span>

associated with increased chances of non-communicable diseases such as
diabetes, cardiovascular problems, different types of cancers, etc. Evidence
suggests that diet-related mobile applications play a vital role in assisting
an individual in making healthier choices and keeping track of food intake.
However, due to an abundance of similar applications, it becomes pertinent to
evaluate each of them in terms of functionality, usability, and possible design
issues to truly determine state-of-the-art solutions for the future. Since
these applications involve implementing multiple user requirements and
recommendations from different dietitians, the evaluation becomes quite
complex. Therefore, this study aims to review existing dietary applications at
length to highlight key features and problems that enhance or undermine an
application&#x27;s usability. For this purpose, we have examined the published
literature from various scientific databases of the CINAHL, Science Direct, and
PUBMED. Out of our findings, fifty-six primary studies met our inclusion
criteria after filtering out titles, abstracts, and full text. A total of 35
apps are analyzed from the selected studies. Our detailed analysis concluded
the comprehensiveness of freely available mHealth applications from users and
dietitians&#x27; frames of reference. Furthermore, we have also specified potential
future challenges and stated recommendations to help develop clinically
accurate diet-related applications.</span>

                                        <span>Hashing plays an important role in information retrieval, due to its low
storage and high speed of processing. Among the techniques available in the
literature, multi-modal hashing, which can encode heterogeneous multi-modal
features into compact hash codes, has received particular attention. Most of
the existing multi-modal hashing methods adopt the fixed weighting factors to
fuse multiple modalities for any query data, which cannot capture the variation
of different queries. Besides, many methods introduce hyper-parameters to
balance many regularization terms that make the optimization harder. Meanwhile,
it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to set proper parameter values. The
limitations may significantly hinder their promotion in real applications. In
this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method that is inspired by the
Hadamard matrix. The proposed method captures the multi-modal feature
information in an adaptive manner and preserves the discriminative semantic
information in the hash codes. Our framework is flexible and involves a very
few hyper-parameters. Extensive experimental results show the method is
effective and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms.</span>

rely on text annotation, such as human generated captions or machine generated
automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the
Audio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a
shared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To
circumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations
from randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train
AVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,
and evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet&#x27;s learned
representations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn
audio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly
processes raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a
multi-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval. Our code,
data, and trained models will be released at avlnet.csail.mit.edu</span>

platforms. While multimodal emotion recognition techniques are gaining research
attention, there is a lack of deeper understanding on how visual and non-visual
features can be used to better recognize emotions in certain contexts, but not
others. This study analyzes the interplay between the effects of multimodal
emotion features derived from facial expressions, tone and text in conjunction
with two key contextual factors: i) gender of the speaker, and ii) duration of
the emotional episode. Using a large public dataset of 2,176 manually annotated
YouTube videos, we found that while multimodal features consistently
outperformed bimodal and unimodal features, their performance varied
significantly across different emotions, gender and duration contexts.
Multimodal features performed particularly better for male speakers in
recognizing most emotions. Furthermore, multimodal features performed
particularly better for shorter than for longer videos in recognizing neutral
and happiness, but not sadness and anger. These findings offer new insights
towards the development of more context-aware emotion recognition and
empathetic systems.</span>

level using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for
generating waveforms, similar to wavenet \cite{oord2016wavenet}. This is fully
probabilistic, auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends
only on the previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used
wavenet architecture by up to 9\% on a similar dataset for predicting the next
step. Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which
audio samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show
how causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform
synthesis. We also show that this performance can be improved by another 2\% by
conditioning samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model
to synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of
potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer
architectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from
generating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid
the generation process.</span>

gained popularity in the computer vision community, and thus various approaches
have been proposed. Among these approaches, the method using I3D network
achieves the highest recognition accuracy on large public datasets for WSLR.
However, the method with I3D only utilizes appearance information of the upper
body of the signers to recognize sign language words. On the other hand, in
WSLR, the information of local regions, such as the hand shape and facial
expression, and the positional relationship among the body and both hands are
important. Thus in this work, we utilized local region images of both hands and
face, along with skeletal information to capture local information and the
positions of both hands relative to the body, respectively. In other words, we
propose a novel multi-stream WSLR framework, in which a stream with local
region images and a stream with skeletal information are introduced by
extending I3D network to improve the recognition accuracy of WSLR. From the
experimental results on WLASL dataset, it is evident that the proposed method
has achieved about 15% improvement in the Top-1 accuracy than the existing
conventional methods.</span>

                                        <span>Images can convey rich semantics and induce various emotions in viewers.
Recently, with the rapid advancement of emotional intelligence and the
explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated
to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this survey, we will
comprehensively review the development of AICA in the recent two decades,
especially focusing on the state-of-the-art methods with respect to three main
challenges -- the affective gap, perception subjectivity, and label noise and
absence. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models
that have been widely employed in AICA and description of available datasets
for performing evaluation with quantitative comparison of label noise and
dataset bias. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on
(1) emotion feature extraction, including both handcrafted and deep features,
(2) learning methods on dominant emotion recognition, personalized emotion
prediction, emotion distribution learning, and learning from noisy data or few
labels, and (3) AICA based applications. Finally, we discuss some challenges
and promising research directions in the future, such as image content and
context understanding, group emotion clustering, and viewer-image interaction.</span>

standardized codes, which is an essential part of medical information systems
and health insurance reimbursement. Manual coding by trained human coders is
time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, automated coding algorithms have been
developed, building especially on the recent advances in machine learning and
deep neural networks. To solve the challenges of encoding lengthy and noisy
clinical documents and capturing code associations, we propose a multitask
recalibrated aggregation network. In particular, multitask learning shares
information across different coding schemes and captures the dependencies
between different medical codes. Feature recalibration and aggregation in
shared modules enhance representation learning for lengthy notes. Experiments
with a real-world MIMIC-III dataset show significantly improved predictive
performance.</span>

relation classification with a localized, marker-free context representation.
The model is trained using strong within-sentence negative samples, which are
efficiently extracted in a single BERT pass. These aspects facilitate a search
over all spans in the sentence.

In ablation studies, we demonstrate the benefits of pre-training, strong
negative sampling and localized context. Our model outperforms prior work by up

                                        <span>Natural language is compositional; the meaning of a sentence is a function of
the meaning of its parts. This property allows humans to create and interpret
novel sentences, generalizing robustly outside their prior experience. Neural
networks have been shown to struggle with this kind of generalization, in
particular performing poorly on tasks designed to assess compositional
generalization (i.e. where training and testing distributions differ in ways
that would be trivial for a compositional strategy to resolve). Their poor
performance on these tasks may in part be due to the nature of supervised
learning which assumes training and testing data to be drawn from the same
distribution. We implement a meta-learning augmented version of supervised
learning whose objective directly optimizes for out-of-distribution
generalization. We construct pairs of tasks for meta-learning by sub-sampling
existing training data. Each pair of tasks is constructed to contain relevant
examples, as determined by a similarity metric, in an effort to inhibit models
from memorizing their input. Experimental results on the COGS and SCAN datasets
show that our similarity-driven meta-learning can improve generalization
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Recently generating natural language explanations has shown very promising
results in not only offering interpretable explanations but also providing
additional information and supervision for prediction. However, existing
approaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for
training while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time
consuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for
interpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of
human annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural
language explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning
process of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for
optimization where an explanation generation module and an
explanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and
mutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based
self-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It
alternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new
explanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural
language understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make
effective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also
generate good natural language explanation.</span>

levels comparable to human transcribers, which led researchers to debate if the
machine has reached human performance. Previous work focused on the English
language and modular hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN) systems.
In this paper, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking for end-to-end
transformer ASR, modular HMM-DNN ASR, and human speech recognition (HSR) on the
Arabic language and its dialects. For the HSR, we evaluate linguist performance
and lay-native speaker performance on a new dataset collected as a part of this
study. For ASR the end-to-end work led to 12.5%, 27.5%, 33.8% WER; a new
performance milestone for the MGB2, MGB3, and MGB5 challenges respectively. Our
results suggest that human performance in the Arabic language is still
considerably better than the machine with an absolute WER gap of 3.5% on
average.</span>

as a major concern, where it expresses abusive speech that targets specific
group characteristics, such as gender, religion or ethnicity to spread
violence. Earlier people use to verbally deliver hate speeches but now with the
expansion of technology, some people are deliberately using social media
platforms to spread hate by posting, sharing, commenting, etc. Whether it is
Christchurch mosque shootings or hate crimes against Asians in west, it has
been observed that the convicts are very much influenced from hate text present
online. Even though AI systems are in place to flag such text but one of the
key challenges is to reduce the false positive rate (marking non hate as hate),
so that these systems can detect hate speech without undermining the freedom of
expression. In this paper, we use ETHOS hate speech detection dataset and
analyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or
integrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with
static BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is
observed that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to
using FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings. In comparison to fine-tuned BERT,
one metric that significantly improved is specificity.</span>

                                        <span>Electronic health record (EHR) coding is the task of assigning ICD codes to
each EHR. Most previous studies either only focus on the frequent ICD codes or
treat rare and frequent ICD codes in the same way. These methods perform well
on frequent ICD codes but due to the extremely unbalanced distribution of ICD
codes, the performance on rare ones is far from satisfactory. We seek to
improve the performance for both frequent and rare ICD codes by using a
contrastive graph-based EHR coding framework, CoGraph, which re-casts EHR
coding as a few-shot learning task. First, we construct a heterogeneous EHR
word-entity (HEWE) graph for each EHR, where the words and entities extracted
from an EHR serve as nodes and the relations between them serve as edges. Then,
CoGraph learns similarities and dissimilarities between HEWE graphs from
different ICD codes so that information can be transferred among them. In a
few-shot learning scenario, the model only has access to frequent ICD codes
during training, which might force it to encode features that are useful for
frequent ICD codes only. To mitigate this risk, CoGraph devises two graph
contrastive learning schemes, GSCL and GECL, that exploit the HEWE graph
structures so as to encode transferable features. GSCL utilizes the
intra-correlation of different sub-graphs sampled from HEWE graphs while GECL
exploits the inter-correlation among HEWE graphs at different clinical stages.
Experiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that CoGraph significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on EHR coding, not only on frequent ICD
codes, but also on rare codes, in terms of several evaluation indicators. On
frequent ICD codes, GSCL and GECL improve the classification accuracy and F1 by
1.31% and 0.61%, respectively, and on rare ICD codes CoGraph has more obvious
improvements by 2.12% and 2.95%.</span>

intelligible and natural speech given text, is a hot research topic in speech,
language, and machine learning communities and has broad applications in the
industry. As the development of deep learning and artificial intelligence,
neural network-based TTS has significantly improved the quality of synthesized
speech in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on
neural TTS, aiming to provide a good understanding of current research and
future trends. We focus on the key components in neural TTS, including text
analysis, acoustic models and vocoders, and several advanced topics, including
fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc.
We further summarize resources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource
implementations) and discuss future research directions. This survey can serve
both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on TTS.</span>

business decisions has become increasingly commonplace, specifically providing
intelligent recommendations to automated decision making. This has led to an
increase in the use of customers personal data to analyze customer behavior and
predict their interests in a companys products. Increased use of this customer
personal data can lead to better models but also to the potential of customer
data being leaked, reverse engineered, and mishandled. In this paper, we assess
differential privacy as a solution to address these privacy problems by
building privacy protections into the data engineering and model training
stages of predictive model development. Our interest is a pragmatic
implementation in an operational environment, which necessitates a general
purpose differentially private modeling framework, and we evaluate one such
tool from LeapYear as applied to the Credit Risk modeling domain. Credit Risk
Model is a major modeling methodology in banking and finance where user data is
analyzed to determine the total Expected Loss to the bank. We examine the
application of differential privacy on the credit risk model and evaluate the
performance of a Differentially Private Model with a Non Differentially Private
Model. Credit Risk Model is a major modeling methodology in banking and finance

translation (MT). We annotated MT evaluations conducted in 769 research papers
published from 2010 to 2020. Our study shows that practices for automatic MT
evaluation have dramatically changed during the past decade and follow
concerning trends. An increasing number of MT evaluations exclusively rely on
differences between BLEU scores to draw conclusions, without performing any
kind of statistical significance testing nor human evaluation, while at least
108 metrics claiming to be better than BLEU have been proposed. MT evaluations
in recent papers tend to copy and compare automatic metric scores from previous
work to claim the superiority of a method or an algorithm without confirming
neither exactly the same training, validating, and testing data have been used
nor the metric scores are comparable. Furthermore, tools for reporting
standardized metric scores are still far from being widely adopted by the MT
community. After showing how the accumulation of these pitfalls leads to
dubious evaluation, we propose a guideline to encourage better automatic MT
evaluation along with a simple meta-evaluation scoring method to assess its
credibility.</span>

presents significant opportunities for improving the resulting embeddings, and
consequently for increased performance in downstream applications. Yet, little
research effort has focussed on this area and much of the carried out research
reports only marginally improved results compared to models trained without
temporal scopes (static models). Furthermore, rather than leveraging existing
work on static models, they introduce new models specific to temporal knowledge
graphs. We propose a novel perspective that takes advantage of the power of
existing static embedding models by focussing effort on manipulating the data
instead. Our method, SpliMe, draws inspiration from the field of signal
processing and early work in graph embedding. We show that SpliMe competes with
or outperforms the current state of the art in temporal KGE. Additionally, we
uncover issues with the procedure currently used to assess the performance of
static models on temporal graphs and introduce two ways to counteract them.</span>

to meet the requirements of customers. One way how this research is conducted
is that a domain expert gathers and categorizes user-generated content into a
complex and fine-grained class structure. In many of such cases, little data
meets complex annotations. It is not yet fully understood how this can be
leveraged successfully for classification. We examine the classification
accuracy of expert labels when used with a) many fine-grained classes and b)
few abstract classes. For scenario b) we compare abstract class labels given by
the domain expert as baseline and by automatic hierarchical clustering. We
compare this to another baseline where the entire class structure is given by a
completely unsupervised clustering approach. By doing so, this work can serve
as an example of how complex expert annotations are potentially beneficial and
can be utilized in the most optimal way for opinion mining in highly specific
domains. By exploring across a range of techniques and experiments, we find
that automated class abstraction approaches in particular the unsupervised
approach performs remarkably well against domain expert baseline on text
classification tasks. This has the potential to inspire opinion mining
applications in order to support market researchers in practice and to inspire
fine-grained automated content analysis on a large scale.</span>

                                        <span>Text summarization is an approach for identifying important information
present within text documents. This computational technique aims to generate
shorter versions of the source text, by including only the relevant and salient
information present within the source text. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to summarize a text document by clustering its contents based on latent
topics produced using topic modeling techniques and by generating extractive
summaries for each of the identified text clusters. All extractive
sub-summaries are later combined to generate a summary for any given source
document. We utilize the lesser used and challenging WikiHow dataset in our
approach to text summarization. This dataset is unlike the commonly used news
datasets which are available for text summarization. The well-known news
datasets present their most important information in the first few lines of
their source texts, which make their summarization a lesser challenging task
when compared to summarizing the WikiHow dataset. Contrary to these news
datasets, the documents in the WikiHow dataset are written using a generalized
approach and have lesser abstractedness and higher compression ratio, thus
proposing a greater challenge to generate summaries. A lot of the current
state-of-the-art text summarization techniques tend to eliminate important
information present in source documents in the favor of brevity. Our proposed
technique aims to capture all the varied information present in source
documents. Although the dataset proved challenging, after performing extensive
tests within our experimental setup, we have discovered that our model produces
encouraging ROUGE results and summaries when compared to the other published
extractive and abstractive text summarization models.</span>

performance of a wide range of tasks in recent years, important questions are
being raised about their robustness and their underlying sensitivity to
systematic biases that may exist in their training and test data. Such issues
come to be manifest in performance problems when faced with out-of-distribution
data in the field. One recent solution has been to use counterfactually
augmented datasets in order to reduce any reliance on spurious patterns that
may exist in the original data. Producing high-quality augmented data can be
costly and time-consuming as it usually needs to involve human feedback and
crowdsourcing efforts. In this work, we propose an alternative by describing
and evaluating an approach to automatically generating counterfactual data for
data augmentation and explanation. A comprehensive evaluation on several
different datasets and using a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks
demonstrate how our approach can achieve significant improvements in model
performance when compared to models training on the original data and even when
compared to models trained with the benefit of human-generated augmented data.</span>

allow for quick benchmarking, it isn&#x27;t clear how such metrics reflect human

previous protocols fail to account for belief biases affecting human
performance, which may lead to misleading conclusions. We provide an overview
of belief bias, its role in human evaluation, and ideas for NLP practitioners
on how to account for it. For two experimental paradigms, we present a case
study of gradient-based explainability introducing simple ways to account for
humans&#x27; prior beliefs: models of varying quality and adversarial examples. We
show that conclusions about the highest performing methods change when

                                        <span>Recent advances in neural multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models have
enabled the generation of reasonably good speech quality with a single model
and made it possible to synthesize the speech of a speaker with limited
training data. Fine-tuning to the target speaker data with the multi-speaker
model can achieve better quality, however, there still exists a gap compared to
the real speech sample and the model depends on the speaker. In this work, we
propose GANSpeech, which is a high-fidelity multi-speaker TTS model that adopts
the adversarial training method to a non-autoregressive multi-speaker TTS
model. In addition, we propose simple but efficient automatic scaling methods
for feature matching loss used in adversarial training. In the subjective
listening tests, GANSpeech significantly outperformed the baseline
multi-speaker FastSpeech and FastSpeech2 models, and showed a better MOS score
than the speaker-specific fine-tuned FastSpeech2.</span>

technique which require labeled dataset for their training. The supervised
technique necessitates that for every new rule text, a manually labeled dataset
must be created. This is tedious and error prone. This paper introduces and
demonstrates how unsupervised learning technique can be applied in the
development of CMR. Specifically, we demonstrate how unsupervised learning can
be used in rule extraction and entailment modules of CMR. Compared to the
current best CMR tool, our developed framework reports 3.3% improvement in

                                        <span>Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) exploits only a handful of
annotations to identify and classify named entity mentions. Prototypical
network shows superior performance on few-shot NER. However, existing
prototypical methods fail to differentiate rich semantics in other-class words,
which will aggravate overfitting under few shot scenario. To address the issue,
we propose a novel model, Mining Undefined Classes from Other-class (MUCO),
that can automatically induce different undefined classes from the other class
to improve few-shot NER. With these extra-labeled undefined classes, our method
will improve the discriminative ability of NER classifier and enhance the
understanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms five
state-of-the-art models in both 1-shot and 5-shots settings on four NER
benchmarks. We will release the code upon acceptance. The source code is

                                        <span>The evaluation of neural machine translation systems is usually built upon
generated translation of a certain decoding method (e.g., beam search) with
evaluation metrics over the generated translation (e.g., BLEU). However, this
evaluation framework suffers from high search errors brought by heuristic
search algorithms and is limited by its nature of evaluation over one best
candidate. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation protocol, which not
only avoids the effect of search errors but provides a system-level evaluation
in the perspective of model ranking. In particular, our method is based on our
newly proposed exact top-$k$ decoding instead of beam search. Our approach
evaluates model errors by the distance between the candidate spaces scored by
the references and the model respectively. Extensive experiments on WMT&#x27;14
English-German demonstrate that bad ranking ability is connected to the
well-known beam search curse, and state-of-the-art Transformer models are
facing serious ranking errors. By evaluating various model architectures and
techniques, we provide several interesting findings. Finally, to effectively
approximate the exact search algorithm with same time cost as original beam
search, we present a minimum heap augmented beam search algorithm.</span>

various smart devices with ease. However, such systems are limited to the
preset list of intents-terms or commands, which restricts the quick
customization of personal devices to new intents. This paper presents a
few-shot spoken intent classification approach with task-agnostic
representations via meta-learning paradigm. Specifically, we leverage the
popular representation-based meta-learning learning to build a task-agnostic
representation of utterances, that then use a linear classifier for prediction.
We evaluate three such approaches on our novel experimental protocol developed
on two popular spoken intent classification datasets: Google Commands and the
Fluent Speech Commands dataset. For a 5-shot (1-shot) classification of novel
classes, the proposed framework provides an average classification accuracy of
88.6% (76.3%) on the Google Commands dataset, and 78.5% (64.2%) on the Fluent
Speech Commands dataset. The performance is comparable to traditionally
supervised classification models with abundant training samples.</span>

less than ten years, and has already entered a mature phase. While considered
as the most widely used solution for Machine Translation, its performance on
low-resource language pairs still remains sub-optimal compared to the
high-resource counterparts, due to the unavailability of large parallel
corpora. Therefore, the implementation of NMT techniques for low-resource
language pairs has been receiving the spotlight in the recent NMT research
arena, thus leading to a substantial amount of research reported on this topic.
This paper presents a detailed survey of research advancements in low-resource
language NMT (LRL-NMT), along with a quantitative analysis aimed at identifying
the most popular solutions. Based on our findings from reviewing previous work,
this survey paper provides a set of guidelines to select the possible NMT
technique for a given LRL data setting. It also presents a holistic view of the
LRL-NMT research landscape and provides a list of recommendations to further
enhance the research efforts on LRL-NMT.</span>

                                        <span>Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing
log-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact
token-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such
training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,
when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence
supervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a
target n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws
inspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant
to images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the
target sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a
convolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to
implement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we
conduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target
sequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine
translation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms
cross entropy loss on these three tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Decomposable tasks are complex and comprise of a hierarchy of sub-tasks.
Spoken intent prediction, for example, combines automatic speech recognition
and natural language understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, typically
hold out examples for only the surface-level sub-task. As a result, models with
similar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance
differences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between
competitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct
robust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility
functions. Given a dataset for a decomposable task, our method optimally
creates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of
the end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we
generate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights
datasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing
natural language understanding abilities, and one with held-out speakers to
test speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10%
between end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original
test sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable
comparisons between different architectures, driving future model development.
We release our splits and tools for the community.</span>

detecting the language contained in a document based on its content. The
present Language Identification techniques presume that a document contains
text in one of the fixed set of languages, however, this presumption is
incorrect when dealing with multilingual document which includes content in
more than one possible language. Due to the unavailability of large standard
corpora for Hindi-English mixed lingual language processing tasks we propose
the language lexicons, a novel kind of lexical database that supports several
multilingual language processing tasks. These lexicons are built by learning
classifiers over transliterated Hindi and English vocabulary. The designed
lexicons possess richer quantitative characteristic than its primary source of

organizes respective tasks where different teams develop systems that are

needs of experts in the biomedical domain. This paper presents an overview of
the ninth edition of the BioASQ challenge in the context of the Conference and
Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2021. In this year, a new question
answering task, named Synergy, is introduced to support researchers studying
the COVID-19 disease and measure the ability of the participating teams to
discern information while the problem is still developing. In total, 42 teams
with more than 170 systems were registered to participate in the four tasks of
the challenge. The evaluation results, similarly to previous years, show a
performance gain against the baselines which indicates the continuous
improvement of the state-of-the-art in this field.</span>

sources and has met significant success by adopting multi-document
summarization techniques. However, previous works generally view the abstract
as plain text, ignoring the fact that it is a description of a certain entity
and can be decomposed into different topics. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage model TWAG that guides the abstract generation with topical
information. First, we detect the topic of each input paragraph with a
classifier trained on existing Wikipedia articles to divide input documents
into different topics. Then, we predict the topic distribution of each abstract
sentence, and decode the sentence from topic-aware representations with a
Pointer-Generator network. We evaluate our model on the WikiCatSum dataset, and
the results show that \modelnames outperforms various existing baselines and is
capable of generating comprehensive abstracts. Our code and dataset can be

NLP are insufficient to determine gender bias in our case law database and
propose an alternative approach. We show that existing algorithms&#x27; inconsistent
results are consequences of prior research&#x27;s definition of biases themselves.
Bias detection algorithms rely on groups of words to represent bias (e.g.,
&#x27;salary,&#x27; &#x27;job,&#x27; and &#x27;boss&#x27; to represent employment as a potentially biased
theme against women in text). However, the methods to build these groups of
words have several weaknesses, primarily that the word lists are based on the
researchers&#x27; own intuitions. We suggest two new methods of automating the
creation of word lists to represent biases. We find that our methods outperform
current NLP bias detection methods. Our research improves the capabilities of
NLP technology to detect bias and highlights gender biases present in
influential case law. In order test our NLP bias detection method&#x27;s
performance, we regress our results of bias in case law against U.S census data

the basketball team Lebron James plays for. But language models (LMs) are
trained on snapshots of data collected at a specific moment in time, and this
can limit their utility, especially in the closed-book setting where the
pretraining corpus must contain the facts the model should memorize. We
introduce a diagnostic dataset aimed at probing LMs for factual knowledge that
changes over time and highlight problems with LMs at either end of the spectrum
-- those trained on specific slices of temporal data, as well as those trained
on a wide range of temporal data. To mitigate these problems, we propose a
simple technique for jointly modeling text with its timestamp. This improves
memorization of seen facts from the training time period, as well as
calibration on predictions about unseen facts from future time periods. We also
show that models trained with temporal context can be efficiently &#x60;&#x60;refreshed&#x27;&#x27;

challenging task in natural language generation. Since several given topics
only provide limited source information, utilizing various topic-related
knowledge is essential for improving essay generation performance. However,
previous works cannot sufficiently use that knowledge to facilitate the
generation procedure. This paper aims to improve essay generation by extracting
information from both internal and external knowledge. Thus, a topic-to-essay
generation model with comprehensive knowledge enhancement, named TEGKE, is
proposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays
are fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features
would be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network
which only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared
with the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge
graph encoder is proposed. Unlike the previous works only using the nearest
neighbors of topics in the commonsense base, our topic knowledge graph encoder
could exploit more structural and semantic information of the commonsense
knowledge graph to facilitate essay generation. Moreover, the adversarial
training based on the Wasserstein distance is proposed to improve generation
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TEGKE could achieve
state-of-the-art performance on both automatic and human evaluation.</span>

from large scale enterprise documents with minimal efforts of human
intervention. In the design and deployment of such a knowledge mining system
for enterprise, we faced several challenges including data distributional
shift, performance evaluation, compliance requirements and other practical
issues. We leveraged state-of-the-art deep learning models to extract
information (named entities and definitions) at per document level, then
further applied classical machine learning techniques to process global
statistical information to improve the knowledge base. Experimental results are
reported on actual enterprise documents. This system is currently serving as

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in image
restoration tasks by directly learning a powerful non-linear mapping from
corrupted images to their latent clean ones. However, there still exist two
major limitations for these deep learning (DL)-based methods. Firstly, the
noises contained in real corrupted images are very complex, usually neglected
and largely under-estimated in most current methods. Secondly, existing DL
methods are mostly trained on one pre-assumed degradation process for all of
the training image pairs, such as the widely used bicubic downsampling
assumption in the image super-resolution task, inevitably leading to poor
generalization performance when the true degradation does not match with such
assumed one. To address these issues, we propose a unified generative model for
the image restoration, which elaborately configures the degradation process
from the latent clean image to the observed corrupted one. Specifically,
different from most of current methods, the pixel-wisely non-i.i.d. Gaussian
distribution, being with more flexibility, is adopted in our method to fit the
complex real noises. Furthermore, the method is built on the general image
degradation process, making it capable of adapting diverse degradations under
one single model. Besides, we design a variational inference algorithm to learn
all parameters involved in the proposed model with explicit form of objective
loss. Specifically, beyond traditional variational methodology, two DNNs are
employed to parameterize the posteriori distributions, one to infer the
distribution of the latent clean image, and another to infer the distribution
of the image noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method on three classical image restoration tasks, including image
denoising, image super-resolution and JPEG image deblocking.</span>

with the main design goal of enabling both machine learning researchers and
non-technical geospatial domain experts to experiment with domain-specific
signals and datasets for solving a variety of complex problems on their own.
This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex
Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning
models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the
ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic
segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts
derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a
scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for
domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving
business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation
and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and
deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its
design along with showcasing sample applications to motivate the idea of
lowering the bar to using AI.</span>

                                        <span>Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much
higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural
networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input
feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between
float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade
these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.
In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input
feature as the output response. We first develop a theoretical foundation for
AdderNets, by showing that both the single hidden layer AdderNet and the
width-bounded deep AdderNet with ReLU activation functions are universal
function approximators. An approximation bound for AdderNets with a single
hidden layer is also presented. We further analyze the influence of this new
similarity measure on the optimization of neural network and develop a special
training scheme for AdderNets. Based on the gradient magnitude, an adaptive
learning rate strategy is proposed to enhance the training procedure of
AdderNets. AdderNets can achieve a 75.7% Top-1 accuracy and a 92.3% Top-5
accuracy using ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in
the convolutional layer.</span>

                                        <span>Features play a crucial role in computer vision. Initially designed to detect
salient elements by means of handcrafted algorithms, features are now often
learned by different layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper
develops a generic computer vision system based on features extracted from
trained CNNs. Multiple learned features are combined into a single structure to
work on different image classification tasks. The proposed system was
experimentally derived by testing several approaches for extracting features
from the inner layers of CNNs and using them as inputs to SVMs that are then
combined by sum rule. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce
the high dimensionality of inner layers. The resulting vision system is shown
to significantly boost the performance of standard CNNs across a large and
diverse collection of image data sets. An ensemble of different topologies
using the same approach obtains state-of-the-art results on a virus data set.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is clinically relevant in diagnoses, prognoses and surgery treatment, which
requires multiple modalities to provide complementary morphological and
physiopathologic information. However, missing modality commonly occurs due to
image corruption, artifacts, different acquisition protocols or allergies to
certain contrast agents in clinical practice. Though existing efforts
demonstrate the possibility of a unified model for all missing situations, most
of them perform poorly when more than one modality is missing. In this paper,
we propose a novel Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) to solve this issue,
in which a series of independent yet related models are trained dedicated to
each missing situation with significantly better results. Specifically, ACN
adopts a novel co-training network, which enables a coupled learning process
for both full modality and missing modality to supplement each other&#x27;s domain
and feature representations, and more importantly, to recover the &#x60;missing&#x27;
information of absent modalities. Then, two unsupervised modules, i.e., entropy
and knowledge adversarial learning modules are proposed to minimize the domain
gap while enhancing prediction reliability and encouraging the alignment of
latent representations, respectively. We also adapt modality-mutual information
knowledge transfer learning to ACN to retain the rich mutual information among
modalities. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018 dataset show that our proposed
method significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods under any missing
situation.</span>

detection with deep edge detectors, based on an observation that the
localization ambiguity of deep edge detectors is mainly caused by the mixing
phenomenon of convolutional neural networks: feature mixing in edge
classification and side mixing during fusing side predictions. The CATS
consists of two modules: a novel tracing loss that performs feature unmixing by
tracing boundaries for better side edge learning, and a context-aware fusion
block that tackles the side mixing by aggregating the complementary merits of
learned side edges. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed CATS can be
integrated into modern deep edge detectors to improve localization accuracy.
With the vanilla VGG16 backbone, in terms of BSDS500 dataset, our CATS improves
the F-measure (ODS) of the RCF and BDCN deep edge detectors by 12% and 6%
respectively when evaluating without using the morphological non-maximal
suppression scheme for edge detection.</span>

                                        <span>Deepfake defense not only requires the research of detection but also
requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods
suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this
problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for
face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to
conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose
coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other
features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles
that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline,
through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users
to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could
achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage
of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For

                                        <span>Contrastive learning (CL) is effective in learning data representations
without label supervision, where the encoder needs to contrast each positive
sample over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy
loss. However, conventional CL is sensitive to how many negative samples are
included and how they are selected. Proposed in this paper is a doubly CL
strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves
separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and
contrastive repulsion (CACR) makes the query not only exert a greater force to
attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative
samples. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection between CACR and CL from
the perspectives of both positive attraction and negative repulsion and shows
the benefits in both efficiency and robustness brought by separately
contrasting within the sampled positive and negative pairs. Extensive
large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only
consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets in
representation learning, but also provides interpretable contrastive weights,
demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed doubly contrastive strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model
robustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus
on the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role
of each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,
we propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,
we provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark
datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.
Surprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among
classes, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust
models. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and
find that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among
different attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger
attack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly
from a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with
less robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple
but effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named
Temperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity
among classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each
image. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than
the PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some
modifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of
the most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise
robustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise
properties in robust models.</span>

points as Gaussians with analytic transmittance. Further, we develop an

photo-realistic 3D digital human heads with a consumer RGB-D selfie camera. The
system only needs the user to take a short selfie RGB-D video while rotating
his/her head, and can produce a high quality head reconstruction in less than
30 seconds. Our main contribution is a new facial geometry modeling and
reflectance synthesis procedure that significantly improves the
state-of-the-art. Specifically, given the input video a two-stage frame
selection procedure is first employed to select a few high-quality frames for
reconstruction. Then a differentiable renderer based 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)
fitting algorithm is applied to recover facial geometries from multiview RGB-D
data, which takes advantages of a powerful 3DMM basis constructed with
extensive data generation and perturbation. Our 3DMM has much larger expressive
capacities than conventional 3DMM, allowing us to recover more accurate facial
geometry using merely linear basis. For reflectance synthesis, we present a
hybrid approach that combines parametric fitting and CNNs to synthesize
high-resolution albedo/normal maps with realistic hair/pore/wrinkle details.
Results show that our system can produce faithful 3D digital human faces with
extremely realistic details. The main code and the newly constructed 3DMM basis
is publicly available.</span>

system developed with the goal of pursuing the long-awaited vision of a
personalized visual Memex. MemX captures human visual attention on the fly,
analyzes the salient visual content, and records moments of personal interest
in the form of compact video snippets. Accurate attentive scene detection and
analysis on resource-constrained platforms is challenging because these tasks
are computation and energy intensive. We propose a new temporal visual
attention network that unifies human visual attention tracking and salient
visual content analysis. Attention tracking focuses computation-intensive video
analysis on salient regions, while video analysis makes human attention
detection and tracking more accurate. Using the YouTube-VIS dataset and 30

                                        <span>Unsupervised disentanglement has been shown to be theoretically impossible
without inductive biases on the models and the data. As an alternative
approach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors
of variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true
generative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we
argue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that
describe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for
disentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as
separating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly
specified. Our success in this challenging setting, demonstrated on synthetic
benchmarks, gives rise to leveraging off-the-shelf image descriptors to
partially annotate a subset of attributes in real image domains (e.g. of human
faces) with minimal manual effort. Specifically, we use a recent language-image
embedding model (CLIP) to annotate a set of attributes of interest in a
zero-shot manner and demonstrate state-of-the-art disentangled image
manipulation results.</span>

can improve human and computer use of medical images. A CNN-based classifier
was developed to identify body regions in CT and MRI. 17 CT (18 MRI) body
regions covering the entire human body were defined for the classification
task. Three retrospective databases were built for the AI model training,
validation, and testing, with a balanced distribution of studies per body
region. The test databases originated from a different healthcare network.
Accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier was evaluated for patient age,
patient gender, institution, scanner manufacturer, contrast, slice thickness,
MRI sequence, and CT kernel. The data included a retrospective cohort of 2,934
anonymized CT cases (training: 1,804 studies, validation: 602 studies, test:
528 studies) and 3,185 anonymized MRI cases (training: 1,911 studies,
validation: 636 studies, test: 638 studies). 27 institutions from primary care
hospitals, community hospitals and imaging centers contributed to the test
datasets. The data included cases of all genders in equal proportions and
subjects aged from a few months old to +90 years old. An image-level prediction
accuracy of 91.9% (90.2 - 92.1) for CT, and 94.2% (92.0 - 95.6) for MRI was
achieved. The classification results were robust across all body regions and
confounding factors. Due to limited data, performance results for subjects
under 10 years-old could not be reliably evaluated. We show that deep learning
models can classify CT and MRI images by body region including lower and upper
extremities with high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two
adjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two
adjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain
semantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use
optical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing
are indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex
problems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without
using problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep
neural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based
Generative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a
learning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain
semantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated
image is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an
invertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by
generative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.
Through experiments, we \sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed
algorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new
possibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful
in that it is the world&#x27;s first attempt to use invertible networks instead of
optical flows for video interpolation.</span>

                                        <span>Most deep learning models are data-driven and the excellent performance is
highly dependent on the abundant and diverse datasets. However, it is very hard
to obtain and label the datasets of some specific scenes or applications. If we
train the detector using the data from one domain, it cannot perform well on
the data from another domain due to domain shift, which is one of the big
challenges of most object detection models. To address this issue, some
image-to-image translation techniques have been employed to generate some fake
data of some specific scenes to train the models. With the advent of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), we could realize unsupervised image-to-image
translation in both directions from a source to a target domain and from the
target to the source domain. In this study, we report a new approach to making
use of the generated images. We propose to concatenate the original 3-channel
images and their corresponding GAN-generated fake images to form 6-channel
representations of the dataset, hoping to address the domain shift problem
while exploiting the success of available detection models. The idea of
augmented data representation may inspire further study on object detection and
other applications.</span>

Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Our end-to-end approach learns progressively refined
generative embedding spaces constrained within and across the involved
modalities (visual, language). The inter-modal constraints are defined between
action sequence embedding and embeddings of Parts of Speech (PoS) tagged words

generalize compositionally, i.e., recognize sequences whose action descriptions
contain words not encountered during training. We also extend our approach to
the more challenging Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem via a

                                        <span>Low-light imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to
insufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,
resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on
low-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as
illumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint
illumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long
exposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these
approaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where
camera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this
problem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that
performs joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.
Considering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high
definition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient
estimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The
coefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the
coefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint
enhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and performs
joint enhancement and denoising in a progressive manner. In contrast to
existing methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when
being adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts
required to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world low-light imaging
applications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</span>

method does not involve training deep networks, is computationally cheap,

                                        <span>Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamentally important to enable
intelligent cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. With recent advancement in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical
videos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary
knowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either
solely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal
representations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative
correlations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture
recognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of
multi-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate
visual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in
the latent feature space. In specific, we first extract embeddings from video
and kinematics sequences with temporal convolutional networks and LSTM units.
Next, we identify multi-relations in these multi-modal embeddings and leverage
them through a hierarchical relational graph learning module. The effectiveness
of our method is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on the public
JIGSAWS dataset, outperforming current uni-modal and multi-modal methods on
both suturing and knot typing tasks. Furthermore, we validated our method on
in-house visual-kinematics datasets collected with da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
platforms in two centers, with consistent promising performance achieved.</span>

                                        <span>Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much
higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural
networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input
feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between
float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade
these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.
In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input
feature as the output response. The influence of this new similarity measure on
the optimization of neural network have been thoroughly analyzed. To achieve a
better performance, we develop a special back-propagation approach for
AdderNets by investigating the full-precision gradient. We then propose an
adaptive learning rate strategy to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets
according to the magnitude of each neuron&#x27;s gradient. As a result, the proposed
AdderNets can achieve 74.9% Top-1 accuracy 91.7% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50
on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in convolution layer. The
codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/huaweinoah/AdderNet.</span>

                                        <span>With increasing popularity of social media platforms hate speech is emerging
as a major concern, where it expresses abusive speech that targets specific
group characteristics, such as gender, religion or ethnicity to spread
violence. Earlier people use to verbally deliver hate speeches but now with the
expansion of technology, some people are deliberately using social media
platforms to spread hate by posting, sharing, commenting, etc. Whether it is
Christchurch mosque shootings or hate crimes against Asians in west, it has
been observed that the convicts are very much influenced from hate text present
online. Even though AI systems are in place to flag such text but one of the
key challenges is to reduce the false positive rate (marking non hate as hate),
so that these systems can detect hate speech without undermining the freedom of
expression. In this paper, we use ETHOS hate speech detection dataset and
analyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or
integrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with
static BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is
observed that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to
using FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings. In comparison to fine-tuned BERT,
one metric that significantly improved is specificity.</span>

                                        <span>Perceiving the world in terms of objects and tracking them through time is a
crucial prerequisite for reasoning and scene understanding. Recently, several
methods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric
representations. However, since these models were evaluated on different
downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic
perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking
of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of
varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging
tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we
compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a
video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which
exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR,
which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest
that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more
powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and
tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that
none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking
scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may
provide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video
representations.</span>

last few decades and their population is expected to further increase in the
upcoming future. Their increasing population is associated with their
increasing needs due to problems like physical disabilities, cognitive issues,
weakened memory and disorganized behavior, that elderly people face with
increasing age. To reduce their financial burden on the world economy and to
enhance their quality of life, it is essential to develop technology-based
solutions that are adaptive, assistive and intelligent in nature. Intelligent
Affect Aware Systems that can not only analyze but also predict the behavior of

forecasting of user experience would provide scope for enhancing the same,

on the scale, quality and diversity of the data used for their training.
Collecting and manually annotating large amount of data can be both
time-consuming and costly tasks to perform. In the case of tasks related to
visual human-centric perception, the collection and distribution of such data
may also face restrictions due to legislation regarding privacy. In addition,
the design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ
deep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even
state-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always
perform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between
the virtual and the real world data. As an attempt to tackle and mitigate the
effect of these issues, we present a method that automatically generates
realistic synthetic data with annotations for a) person detection, b) face
recognition, and c) human pose estimation. The proposed method takes as input
real background images and populates them with human figures in various poses.
Instead of using hand-made 3D human models, we propose the use of models
generated through deep learning methods, further reducing the dataset creation
costs, while maintaining a high level of realism. In addition, we provide
open-source and easy to use tools that implement the proposed pipeline,
allowing for generating highly-realistic synthetic datasets for a variety of
tasks. A benchmarking and evaluation in the corresponding tasks shows that
synthetic data can be effectively used as a supplement to real data.</span>

automated image descriptions. We interviewed experts to establish evaluation
criteria, which we then used to create an evaluation questionnaire for sighted
non-expert raters, and description templates. We used this questionnaire to
evaluate the quality of descriptions which could be generated with a
template-based automatic image describer. We present evidence that these
templates have the potential to generate useful descriptions, and that the
questionnaire identifies problems with description templates.</span>

                                        <span>Logic reasoning is a significant ability of human intelligence and also an
important task in artificial intelligence. The existing logic reasoning
methods, quite often, need to design some reasoning patterns beforehand. This
has led to an interesting question: can logic reasoning patterns be directly
learned from given data? The problem is termed as a data concept logic. In this
study, a learning logic task from images, called a LiLi task, first is
proposed. This task is to learn and reason the logic relation from images,
without presetting any reasoning patterns. As a preliminary exploration, we
design six LiLi data sets (Bitwise And, Bitwise Or, Bitwise Xor, Addition,
Subtraction and Multiplication), in which each image is embedded with a n-digit
number. It is worth noting that a learning model beforehand does not know the
meaning of the n-digit numbers embedded in images and the relation between the
input images and the output image. In order to tackle the task, in this work we
use many typical neural network models and produce fruitful results. However,
these models have the poor performances on the difficult logic task. For
furthermore addressing this task, a novel network framework called a divide and
conquer model by adding some label information is designed, achieving a high
testing accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Longitudinal studies are vital to understanding dynamic changes of the
planet, but labels (e.g., buildings, facilities, roads) are often available
only for a single point in time. We propose a general model, Temporal Cluster
Matching (TCM), for detecting building changes in time series of remotely
sensed imagery when footprint labels are observed only once. The intuition
behind the model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and
outside of building&#x27;s footprint will change when a building is constructed (or
demolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may
look similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.
Similarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different
from the surrounding environment until construction. We further propose a
heuristic method for selecting the parameters of our model which allows it to
be applied in novel settings without requiring data labeling efforts (to fit
the parameters). We apply our model over a dataset of poultry barns from
2016/2017 high-resolution aerial imagery in the Delmarva Peninsula and a
dataset of solar farms from a 2020 mosaic of Sentinel 2 imagery in India. Our
results show that our model performs as well when fit using the proposed
heuristic as it does when fit with labeled data, and further, that supervised
versions of our model perform the best among all the baselines we test against.
Finally, we show that our proposed approach can act as an effective data
augmentation strategy -- it enables researchers to augment existing structure
footprint labels along the time dimension and thus use imagery from multiple
points in time to train deep learning models. We show that this improves the
spatial generalization of such models when evaluated on the same change
detection task.</span>

                                        <span>Facial Expression Recognition is a commercially important application, but
one common limitation is that applications often require making predictions on
out-of-sample distributions, where target images may have very different
properties from the images that the model was trained on. How well, or badly,
do these models do on unseen target domains? In this paper, we provide a
systematic evaluation of domain adaptation in facial expression recognition.
Using state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques and six commonly-used
facial expression datasets (three collected in the lab and three
&quot;in-the-wild&quot;), we conduct extensive round-robin experiments to examine the
classification accuracies for a state-of-the-art CNN model. We also perform
multi-source experiments where we examine a model&#x27;s ability to transfer from
multiple source datasets, including (i) within-setting (e.g., lab to lab), (ii)
cross-setting (e.g., in-the-wild to lab), (iii) mixed-setting (e.g., lab and
wild to lab) transfer learning experiments. We find sobering results that the
accuracy of transfer learning is not high, and varies idiosyncratically with
the target dataset, and to a lesser extent the source dataset. Generally, the
best settings for transfer include fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained
model, and we find that training with more datasets, regardless of setting,
improves transfer performance. We end with a discussion of the need for more --
and regular -- systematic investigations into the generalizability of FER
models, especially for deployed applications.</span>

susceptibility mapping (QSM) data processing: background field removal,
field-to-source inversion, and single-step QSM reconstruction. However, the
conventional padding mechanism used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can
introduce spatial artifacts, especially in QSM background field removal and
single-step QSM which requires inference from total fields with extreme large
values at the edge boundaries of volume of interest. To address this issue, we
propose an improved padding technique which utilizes the neighboring valid
voxels to estimate the invalid voxels of feature maps at volume boundaries in
the neural networks. Studies using simulated and in-vivo data show that the
proposed padding greatly improves estimation accuracy and reduces artifacts in
the results in the tasks of background field removal, field-to-source

that a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.
This is true for many applications, but not all. Myocardial segmentation of
Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic
myocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and
serious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can
vary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,
how can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we
train the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by
proposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation
performance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our
proposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new
metric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn
general features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set
demonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function
outperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from
multiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, our
grading study shows that using extended Dice as an evaluation metric can better
identify segmentation results that need manual correction compared with using
Dice.</span>

video recommendation. Despite lots of existing recommendation methods, user
behaviors on videos, which imply the complex relations between users and
videos, are still far from being fully explored. In the paper, we present a
model named Sagittarius. Sagittarius adopts a graph convolutional neural
network to capture the influence between users and videos. In particular,
Sagittarius differentiates between different user behaviors by weighting and
fuses the semantics of user behaviors into the embeddings of users and videos.
Moreover, Sagittarius combines multiple optimization objectives to learn user
and video embeddings and then achieves the video recommendation by the learned
user and video embeddings. The experimental results on multiple datasets show
that Sagittarius outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of
recall, unique recall and NDCG.</span>

                                        <span>Localizing and counting large ungulates -- hoofed mammals like cows and elk
-- in very high-resolution satellite imagery is an important task for
supporting ecological studies. Prior work has shown that this is feasible with
deep learning based methods and sub-meter multi-spectral satellite imagery. We
extend this line of work by proposing a baseline method, CowNet, that
simultaneously estimates the number of animals in an image (counts), as well as
predicts their location at a pixel level (localizes). We also propose an
methodology for evaluating such models on counting and localization tasks
across large scenes that takes the uncertainty of noisy labels and the
information needed by stakeholders in ecological monitoring tasks into account.
Finally, we benchmark our baseline method with state of the art vision methods
for counting objects in scenes. We specifically test the temporal
generalization of the resulting models over a large landscape in Point Reyes
Seashore, CA. We find that the LC-FCN model performs the best and achieves an
average precision between 0.56 and 0.61 and an average recall between 0.78 and
0.92 over three held out test scenes.</span>

                                        <span>3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation are two tightly
correlated tasks that are both essential for indoor scene understanding,
because they predict the same semantic classes, using positively correlated
high-level features. Current methods use 2D features extracted from early-fused
RGB-D images for 2D segmentation to improve 3D scene completion. We argue that
this sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each
other, and present an Iterative Mutual Enhancement Network (IMENet) to solve
them jointly, which interactively refines the two tasks at the late prediction
stage. Specifically, two refinement modules are developed under a unified
framework for the two tasks. The first is a 2D Deformable Context Pyramid (DCP)
module, which receives the projection from the current 3D predictions to refine
the 2D predictions. In turn, a 3D Deformable Depth Attention (DDA) module is
proposed to leverage the reprojected results from 2D predictions to update the
coarse 3D predictions. This iterative fusion happens to the stable high-level
features of both tasks at a late stage. Extensive experiments on NYU and NYUCAD
datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed iterative late fusion scheme,
and our approach outperforms the state of the art on both 3D semantic scene
completion and 2D semantic segmentation.</span>

the real world is one of the biggest challenges for vision and language
problems. In particular, goal-oriented visual dialogue, where the aim of the
agent is to seek information by asking questions during a turn-taking dialogue,
has been gaining scholarly attention recently. While several existing models
based on the GuessWhat?! dataset have been proposed, the Questioner typically
asks simple category-based questions or absolute spatial questions. This might
be problematic for complex scenes where the objects share attributes or in
cases where descriptive questions are required to distinguish objects. In this
paper, we propose a novel Questioner architecture, called Unified Questioner
Transformer (UniQer), for descriptive question generation with referring
expressions. In addition, we build a goal-oriented visual dialogue task called
CLEVR Ask. It synthesizes complex scenes that require the Questioner to
generate descriptive questions. We train our model with two variants of CLEVR
Ask datasets. The results of the quantitative and qualitative evaluations show
that UniQer outperforms the baseline.</span>

detection, suffer from exceedingly foreground-background imbalance.
Fortunately, modification of loss function appears to solve this puzzle once
and for all. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based adaptive weighted
cross-entropy loss in conjunction with Jaccard distance to facilitate
high-quality pixel-level road crack detection. Our work profoundly demonstrates
the influence of loss functions on detection outcomes, and sheds light on the
sophisticated consecutive improvements in the realm of crack detection.
Specifically, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss, we conduct
extensive experiments on four public databases, i.e., CrackForest, AigleRN,
Crack360, and BJN260. Compared with the vanilla weighted cross-entropy, the
proposed loss significantly speeds up the training process while retaining the
test accuracy.</span>

computer vision datasets. While the impact of label noise on learning in deep
neural networks has been studied in prior work, these studies have exclusively
focused on homogeneous label noise, i.e., the degree of label noise is the same
across all categories. However, in the real-world, label noise is often
heterogeneous, with some categories being affected to a greater extent than
others. Here, we address this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that
heterogeneous label noise would only affect the classes that had label noise
unless there was transfer from those classes to the classes without label
noise. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of computer vision studies
using MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MS-COCO where we imposed heterogeneous
label noise during the training of multi-class, multi-task, and multi-label
systems. Our results provide evidence in support of our hypothesis: label noise
only affects the class affected by it unless there is transfer.</span>

technology for medical image analysis in the last decades. However, it still
remains challenging due to its distinctive complexity of acquiring and
annotating image data, extracting medical domain knowledge, and explaining the
diagnostic decision for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
data-knowledge-driven framework termed as Parallel Medical Imaging (PMI) for
intelligent medical image analysis based on the methodology of interactive
ACP-based parallel intelligence. In the PMI framework, computational
experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to
extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging
systems are introduced to select and prescriptively generate medical image data
in a knowledge-driven way to utilize medical domain knowledge. Through the
closed-loop optimization based on parallel execution, our proposed PMI
framework can boost the generalization ability and alleviate the limitation of
medical interpretation for diagnostic decisions. Furthermore, we illustrate the
preliminary implementation of PMI method through the case studies of mammogram
analysis and skin lesion image analysis. Experimental results on several public

our mixed-supervision GAN to (i) super-resolve histopathology images and (ii)

reduction methods, kernel learning by Semidefinite Programming (SDP), Maximum
Variance Unfolding (MVU) or Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), and its variants. We
first explain how the spectral dimensionality reduction methods can be unified
as kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with different kernels. This
unification can be interpreted as eigenfunction learning or representation of
kernel in terms of distance matrix. Then, since the spectral methods are
unified as kernel PCA, we say let us learn the best kernel for unfolding the
manifold of data to its maximum variance. We first briefly introduce kernel
learning by SDP for the transduction task. Then, we explain MVU in detail.
Various versions of supervised MVU using nearest neighbors graph, by class-wise
unfolding, by Fisher criterion, and by colored MVU are explained. We also
explain out-of-sample extension of MVU using eigenfunctions and kernel mapping.
Finally, we introduce other variants of MVU including action respecting

imaging tasks such as attenuation correction, motion correction, undersampled

to achieve the state-of-the-art in generating high fidelity images for these

as attention maps for GANs trained in a progressive manner, we generate images
of increasing fidelity progressively. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model
on three challenging medical image translation tasks, including PET to CT
translation, undersampled MRI reconstruction, and MRI motion artefact
correction. Our model generalizes well in three different tasks and improves
performance over state of the art under full-supervision and weak-supervision
with limited data. Code is released here:

obtained from crowdsourcing or Web scraping. We propose a new regularization
method, which enables learning robust classifiers in presence of noisy data. To
achieve this goal, we propose a new adversarial regularization scheme based on
the Wasserstein distance. Using this distance allows taking into account
specific relations between classes by leveraging the geometric properties of
the labels space. Our Wasserstein Adversarial Regularization (WAR) encodes a
selective regularization, which promotes smoothness of the classifier between
some classes, while preserving sufficient complexity of the decision boundary
between others. We first discuss how and why adversarial regularization can be
used in the context of label noise and then show the effectiveness of our
method on five datasets corrupted with noisy labels: in both benchmarks and
real datasets, WAR outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

questions about them. Specifically, models need to incorporate a new modality
of text present in the images and reason over it to answer TextVQA questions.
In this challenge, we use generative model T5 for TextVQA task. Based on
pre-trained checkpoint T5-3B from HuggingFace repository, two other
pre-training tasks including masked language modeling(MLM) and relative
position prediction(RPP) are designed to better align object feature and scene
text. In the stage of pre-training, encoder is dedicate to handle the fusion
among multiple modalities: question text, object text labels, scene text
labels, object visual features, scene visual features. After that decoder
generates the text sequence step-by-step, cross entropy loss is required by
default. We use a large-scale scene text dataset in pre-training and then
fine-tune the T5-3B with the TextVQA dataset only.</span>

in coronal and sagittal views, which causes harm to diagnosis and image
post-processing. Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to re-construct
the high-resolution (HR) thin-slice MR images from those low-resolution (LR)
cases, which we refer to as the slice interpolation task in this work. However,
since it is generally difficult to sample abundant paired LR-HR MR images, the
classical fully supervised DL-based models cannot be effectively trained to get
robust performance. To this end, we propose a novel Two-stage Self-supervised
Cycle-consistency Network (TSCNet) for MR slice interpolation, in which a
two-stage self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy is developed for unsupervised
DL network training. The paired LR-HR images are synthesized along the sagittal
and coronal directions of input LR images for network pretraining in the
first-stage SSL, and then a cyclic in-terpolation procedure based on triplet
axial slices is designed in the second-stage SSL for further refinement. More
training samples with rich contexts along all directions are exploited as
guidance to guarantee the improved in-terpolation performance. Moreover, a new
cycle-consistency constraint is proposed to supervise this cyclic procedure,
which encourages the network to reconstruct more realistic HR images. The
experimental results on a real MRI dataset indicate that TSCNet achieves
superior performance over the conventional and other SSL-based algorithms, and
obtains competitive quali-tative and quantitative results compared with the
fully supervised algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Graph-based multi-view clustering has become an active topic due to the
efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship
between multimedia data. However, existing methods have the following
shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large
scale due to the graph construction and eigen-decomposition. (2) They cannot
well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor
points and tensor Schatten p-norm minimization. Specifically, we construct a
hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.
Extensive experimental results on several datasets indicate that our proposed
method outperforms some state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.</span>

Regression module to improve the robustness and accuracy of 3D Detection.
However, since the original input data (point clouds) contains a lot of noise
during collecting the data, which will further affect the training of the

to obtain enough pointcloud. If the objects only contains few point clouds, and
the samples are fed into model with the normal samples together during

perspectives, from lesion detection, data augmentation to clinical surgery
suggestion. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality pseudo-normal
images in the absence of the lesion information. Thus, expensive lesion
segmentation data have been introduced to provide lesion information for the

data when generating pseudo-normal images. We propose a Semi-supervised Medical

images without segmentation masks to generate realistic pseudo-normal images.
Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the best state-of-the-art

limited to simple classification tasks. In this paper, we propose Spiking-GAN,
the first spike-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It employs a kind
of temporal coding scheme called time-to-first-spike coding. We train it using
approximate backpropagation in the temporal domain. We use simple
integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with very high refractory period for our
network which ensures a maximum of one spike per neuron. This makes the model
much sparser than a spike rate-based system. Our modified temporal loss
function called &#x27;Aggressive TTFS&#x27; improves the inference time of the network by
over 33% and reduces the number of spikes in the network by more than 11%
compared to previous works. Our experiments show that on training the network
on the MNIST dataset using this approach, we can generate high quality samples.
Thereby demonstrating the potential of this framework for solving such problems

adopts the single-step adversarial training for quickly developing
adversarially robust models. However, the single-step adversarial training is
most likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs
it will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost
the adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic
overfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the
single-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead
of generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage
Optimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains
the model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and
multi-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall
training overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid
catastrophic overfitting. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets demonstrate that under similar amount of training overhead, the
proposed MOAT exhibits better robustness than either single-step or multi-step
adversarial training methods.</span>

                                        <span>Light binary convolutional neural networks (LB-CNN) are particularly useful
when implemented in low-energy computing platforms as required in many
industrial applications. Herein, a framework for optimizing compact LB-CNN is
introduced and its effectiveness is evaluated. The framework is freely
available and may run on free-access cloud platforms, thus requiring no major
investments. The optimized model is saved in the standardized .h5 format and
can be used as input to specialized tools for further deployment into specific
technologies, thus enabling the rapid development of various intelligent image
sensors. The main ingredient in accelerating the optimization of our model,
particularly the selection of binary convolution kernels, is the Chainer/Cupy
machine learning library offering significant speed-ups for training the output
layer as an extreme-learning machine. Additional training of the output layer
using Keras/Tensorflow is included, as it allows an increase in accuracy.
Results for widely used datasets including MNIST, GTSRB, ORL, VGG show very
good compromise between accuracy and complexity. Particularly, for face
recognition problems a carefully optimized LB-CNN model provides up to 100%
accuracies. Such TinyML solutions are well suited for industrial applications
requiring image recognition with low energy consumption.</span>

                                        <span>We provide a probabilistic interpretation of attention and show that the
standard dot-product attention in transformers is a special case of Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) inference. The proposed approach suggests the use of
Expectation Maximization algorithms for online adaptation of key and value
model parameters. This approach is useful for cases in which external agents,
e.g., annotators, provide inference-time information about the correct values
of some tokens, e.g, the semantic category of some pixels, and we need for this
new information to propagate to other tokens in a principled manner. We
illustrate the approach on an interactive semantic segmentation task in which
annotators and models collaborate online to improve annotation efficiency.
Using standard benchmarks, we observe that key adaptation boosts model
performance ($\sim10\%$ mIoU) in the low feedback regime and value propagation
improves model responsiveness in the high feedback regime. A PyTorch layer
implementation of our probabilistic attention model will be made publicly
available.</span>

                                        <span>Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) aims to improve the resolution and
visual quality of low-resolution (LR) scene text images, and consequently boost
the performance of text recognition. However, most of existing STISR methods
regard text images as natural scene images, ignoring the categorical
information of text. In this paper, we make an inspiring attempt to embed
categorical text prior into STISR model training. Specifically, we adopt the
character probability sequence as the text prior, which can be obtained
conveniently from a text recognition model. The text prior provides categorical
guidance to recover high-resolution (HR) text images. On the other hand, the
reconstructed HR image can refine the text prior in return. Finally, we present
a multi-stage text prior guided super-resolution (TPGSR) framework for STISR.
Our experiments on the benchmark TextZoom dataset show that TPGSR can not only
effectively improve the visual quality of scene text images, but also
significantly improve the text recognition accuracy over existing STISR
methods. Our model trained on TextZoom also demonstrates certain generalization
capability to the LR images in other datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Image inpainting is one of the important tasks in computer vision which
focuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this
paper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses
building blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together
with skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output.
This combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle
various scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this
experimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three
scenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square
regions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out
that our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios.
Performance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris
StreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and
to some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.</span>

                                        <span>We study a practical domain adaptation task, called source-free unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) problem, in which we cannot access source domain data
due to data privacy issues but only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled
target data are available. This task, however, is very difficult due to one key
challenge: the lack of source data and target domain labels makes model
adaptation very challenging. To address this, we propose to mine the hidden
knowledge in the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar
prototypes (i.e., representative features for each source class) as well as
target pseudo labels for domain alignment. To this end, we propose a
Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. Specifically,
CPGA consists of two stages: (1) prototype generation: by exploring the
classification boundary information of the source model, we train a prototype
generator to generate avatar prototypes via contrastive learning. (2) prototype
adaptation: based on the generated source prototypes and target pseudo labels,
we develop a new robust contrastive prototype adaptation strategy to align each
pseudo-labeled target data to the corresponding source prototypes. Extensive
experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>With the goal of making deep learning more label-efficient, a growing number
of papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,
there are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly
stemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the
current literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the
performance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important
generalization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a
lack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and
little or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling
(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art
AL algorithms in the context of image classification, and we carefully study
these issues as facets of effective evaluation. On the positive side, we show
that AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the
use of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,
there is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art
approach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of
how existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number
of examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL
practitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch
size, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at
every round, and other insights.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a new Expectation Propagation (EP) framework for image
restoration using patch-based prior distributions. While Monte Carlo techniques
are classically used to sample from intractable posterior distributions, they
can suffer from scalability issues in high-dimensional inference problems such
as image restoration. To address this issue, EP is used here to approximate the
posterior distributions using products of multivariate Gaussian densities.
Moreover, imposing structural constraints on the covariance matrices of these
densities allows for greater scalability and distributed computation. While the
method is naturally suited to handle additive Gaussian observation noise, it
can also be extended to non-Gaussian noise. Experiments conducted for
denoising, inpainting and deconvolution problems with Gaussian and Poisson
noise illustrate the potential benefits of such flexible approximate Bayesian
method for uncertainty quantification in imaging problems, at a reduced
computational cost compared to sampling techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Object recognition from live video streams comes with numerous challenges
such as the variation in illumination conditions and poses. Convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to perform intelligent visual
object recognition. Yet, CNNs still suffer from severe accuracy degradation,
particularly on illumination-variant datasets. To address this problem, we
propose a new CNN method based on orientation fusion for visual object
recognition. The proposed cloud-based video analytics system pioneers the use
of bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition to split a video frame into
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We further propose these IMFs to endure Reisz
transform to produce monogenic object components, which are in turn used for
the training of CNNs. Past works have demonstrated how the object orientation
component may be used to pursue accuracy levels as high as 93\%. Herein we
demonstrate how a feature-fusion strategy of the orientation components leads
to further improving visual recognition accuracy to 97\%. We also assess the
scalability of our method, looking at both the number and the size of the video
streams under scrutiny. We carry out extensive experimentation on the publicly
available Yale dataset, including also a self generated video datasets, finding
significant improvements (both in accuracy and scale), in comparison to
AlexNet, LeNet and SE-ResNeXt, which are the three most commonly used deep
learning models for visual object recognition and classification.</span>

                                        <span>3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively
researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network
architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research
work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D
representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to
generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of
dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,
a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which
improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple
model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not
only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also
uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the
prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep
network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.
This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.
Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is
compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains
in performance are demonstrated. Code is available at

                                        <span>Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has developed into a prominent tool for
adaptive, scale-based signal analysis in various fields like robotics, security
and biomedical engineering. Since the dramatic increase in amount of data puts
forward higher requirements for the capability of real-time signal analysis, it
is difficult for existing EMD and its variants to trade off the growth of data
dimension and the speed of signal analysis. In order to decompose
multi-dimensional signals at a faster speed, we present a novel
signal-serialization method (serial-EMD), which concatenates multi-variate or
multi-dimensional signals into a one-dimensional signal and uses various
one-dimensional EMD algorithms to decompose it. To verify the effects of the
proposed method, synthetic multi-variate time series, artificial 2D images with
various textures and real-world facial images are tested. Compared with
existing multi-EMD algorithms, the decomposition time becomes significantly
reduced. In addition, the results of facial recognition with Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) extracted using our method can achieve a higher accuracy than
those obtained by existing multi-EMD algorithms, which demonstrates the
superior performance of our method in terms of the quality of IMFs.
Furthermore, this method can provide a new perspective to optimize the existing
EMD algorithms, that is, transforming the structure of the input signal rather
than being constrained by developing envelope computation techniques or signal
decomposition methods. In summary, the study suggests that the serial-EMD
technique is a highly competitive and fast alternative for multi-dimensional
signal analysis.</span>

and consistent performance by professional forensic face examiners and others
who perform face identification tasks in applied scenarios. Current proficiency
tests rely on static sets of stimulus items, and so, cannot be administered
validly to the same individual multiple times. To create a proficiency test, a
large number of items of &quot;known&quot; difficulty must be assembled. Multiple tests
of equal difficulty can be constructed then using subsets of items. Here, we
introduce a proficiency test, the Triad Identity Matching (TIM) test, based on
stimulus difficulty measures based on Item Response Theory (IRT). Participants
view face-image &quot;triads&quot; (N&#x3D;225) (two images of one identity and one image of a
different identity) and select the different identity. In Experiment 1,
university students (N&#x3D;197) showed wide-ranging accuracy on the TIM test.
Furthermore, IRT modeling demonstrated that the TIM test produces items of
various difficulty levels. In Experiment 2, IRT-based item difficulty measures
were used to partition the TIM test into three equally &quot;easy&quot; and three equally
&quot;difficult&quot; subsets. Simulation results indicated that the full set, as well as
curated subsets, of the TIM items yielded reliable estimates of subject
ability. In summary, the TIM test can provide a starting point for developing a
framework that is flexible, calibrated, and adaptive to measure proficiency
across various ability levels (e.g., professionals or populations with face
processing deficits)</span>

difficult due to the large number of frames to consider and the high costs of
running convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on each one. A natural solution is
to perform a subset of the necessary computations ahead of time, as video is
ingested. However, existing ingest-time systems require knowledge of the
specific CNN that will be used in future queries -- a challenging requisite
given the evergrowing space of CNN architectures and training
datasets/methodologies.

This paper presents Boggart, a retrospective video analytics system that
delivers ingest-time speedups in a model-agnostic manner. Our underlying
insight is that traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms are capable of
performing computations that can be used to accelerate diverse queries with
wide-ranging CNNs. Building on this, at ingest-time, Boggart carefully employs
a variety of motion tracking algorithms to identify potential objects and their
trajectories across frames. Then, at query-time, Boggart uses several novel
techniques to collect the smallest sample of CNN results required to meet the
target accuracy: (1) a clustering strategy to efficiently unearth the
inevitable discrepancies between CV- and CNN-generated outputs, and (2) a set
of accuracy-preserving propagation techniques to safely extend sampled results
along each trajectory. Across many videos, CNNs, and queries Boggart
consistently meets accuracy targets while using CNNs sparingly (on 3-54% of
frames).</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning models for human activity recognition (HAR) based on sensor
data have been heavily studied recently. However, the generalization ability of
deep models on complex real-world HAR data is limited by the availability of
high-quality labeled activity data, which are hard to obtain. In this paper, we
design a similarity embedding neural network that maps input sensor signals
onto real vectors through carefully designed convolutional and LSTM layers. The
embedding network is trained with a pairwise similarity loss, encouraging the
clustering of samples from the same class in the embedded real space, and can
be effectively trained on a small dataset and even on a noisy dataset with
mislabeled samples. Based on the learned embeddings, we further propose both
nonparametric and parametric approaches for activity recognition. Extensive
evaluation based on two public datasets has shown that the proposed similarity
embedding network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep models on HAR
classification tasks, is robust to mislabeled samples in the training set, and
can also be used to effectively denoise a noisy dataset.</span>

(MFR) held within the 2021 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB
2021). The competition attracted a total of 10 participating teams with valid
submissions. The affiliations of these teams are diverse and associated with
academia and industry in nine different countries. These teams successfully
submitted 18 valid solutions. The competition is designed to motivate solutions
aiming at enhancing the face recognition accuracy of masked faces. Moreover,
the competition considered the deployability of the proposed solutions by
taking the compactness of the face recognition models into account. A private
dataset representing a collaborative, multi-session, real masked, capture
scenario is used to evaluate the submitted solutions. In comparison to one of
the top-performing academic face recognition solutions, 10 out of the 18
submitted solutions did score higher masked face verification accuracy.</span>

access and expand their utility, since more than 6 million are publicly
available, and they constitute an important corpus to aid research and
education across disciplines. The corpus is growing as new born-digital
documents are included, and since millions of older theses and dissertations
have been converted to digital form to be disseminated electronically in
institutional repositories. In ETDs, as with other scholarly works, figures and
tables can communicate a large amount of information in a concise way. Although
methods have been proposed for extracting figures and tables from born-digital
PDFs, they do not work well with scanned ETDs. Considering this problem, our
assessment of state-of-the-art figure extraction systems is that the reason
they do not function well on scanned PDFs is that they have only been trained
on born-digital documents. To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a
new dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by
humans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.
We use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to
accurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs. We pose and answer
important research questions aimed at finding better methods for figure
extraction from scanned documents. One of those concerns the value for
training, of data augmentation techniques applied to born-digital documents
which are used to train models better suited for figure extraction from scanned
documents. To the best of our knowledge, ScanBank is the first manually
annotated dataset for figure and table extraction for scanned ETDs. A
YOLOv5-based model, trained on ScanBank, outperforms existing comparable
open-source and freely available baseline methods by a considerable margin.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer
vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and
substantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation
(CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by
sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are
usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in
CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed
into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling
distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships
at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of
the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with
background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Finally,
we introduce a novel rehearsal method that is particularly suited for
segmentation. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly
proposed challenging benchmarks.</span>

its motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,
called social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,
deep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social
interactions on a pedestrian&#x27;s motion. The demonstration that these models can
learn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The
models are compared with and without their social interactions module on two
standard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.
Yet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple
constant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model
social interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we
focus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social
interaction modeling and study whether they use social information at
prediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art
approaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.
First, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random
noise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we
use a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down
their inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their
soft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the
convergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that
the soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored
by the models.</span>

                                        <span>Automatically evaluating the quality of image captions can be very
challenging since human language is quite flexible that there can be various
expressions for the same meaning. Most of the current captioning metrics rely
on token level matching between candidate caption and the ground truth label
sentences. It usually neglects the sentence-level information. Motivated by the
auto-encoder mechanism and contrastive representation learning advances, we
propose a learning-based metric for image captioning, which we call Intrinsic
Image Captioning Evaluation($I^2CE$). We develop three progressive model
structures to learn the sentence level representations--single branch model,
dual branches model, and triple branches model. Our empirical tests show that
$I^2CE$ trained with dual branches structure achieves better consistency with
human judgments to contemporary image captioning evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, We select several state-of-the-art image captioning models and
test their performances on the MS COCO dataset concerning both contemporary
metrics and the proposed $I^2CE$. Experiment results show that our proposed
method can align well with the scores generated from other contemporary
metrics. On this concern, the proposed metric could serve as a novel indicator
of the intrinsic information between captions, which may be complementary to
the existing ones.</span>

conceptual one incorporating both behavior and data. It should therefore model
actors, devices, tools, their complex interactions and data flow. To capture
and model these, we take advantage of the latest computer vision methodologies
for generating 3D scene graphs from camera views. We then introduce the
Multimodal Semantic Scene Graph (MSSG) which aims at providing a unified
symbolic, spatiotemporal and semantic representation of surgical procedures.
This methodology aims at modeling the relationship between different components
in surgical domain including medical staff, imaging systems, and surgical
devices, opening the path towards holistic understanding and modeling of
surgical procedures. We then use MSSG to introduce a dynamically generated
graphical user interface tool for surgical procedure analysis which could be
used for many applications including process optimization, OR design and
automatic report generation. We finally demonstrate that the proposed MSSGs
could also be used for synchronizing different complex surgical procedures.
While the system still needs to be integrated into real operating rooms before
getting validated, this conference paper aims mainly at providing the community
with the basic principles of this novel concept through a first prototypal
partial realization based on MVOR dataset.</span>

behavior recognition makes an increasing demand for multi-person pose
estimation-based applications, especially on mobile platforms. However, to
achieve high accuracy, state-of-the-art methods tend to have a large model size
and complex post-processing algorithm, which costs intense computation and long

second -- following the first very successful ABAW Competition held in
conjunction with IEEE FG 2020- Competition that aims at automatically analyzing
affect. ABAW2 is split into three Challenges, each one addressing one of the
three main behavior tasks of valence-arousal estimation, basic expression
classification and action unit detection. All three Challenges are based on a
common benchmark database, Aff-Wild2, which is a large scale in-the-wild
database and the first one to be annotated for all these three tasks. In this
paper, we describe this Competition, to be held in conjunction with ICCV 2021.
We present the three Challenges, with the utilized Competition corpora. We
outline the evaluation metrics and present the baseline system with its

                                        <span>Domain generalization in person re-identification is a highly important
meaningful and practical task in which a model trained with data from several
source domains is expected to generalize well to unseen target domains. Domain
adversarial learning is a promising domain generalization method that aims to
remove domain information in the latent representation through adversarial
training. However, in person re-identification, the domain and class are
correlated, and we theoretically show that domain adversarial learning will
lose certain information about class due to this domain-class correlation.
Inspired by casual inference, we propose to perform interventions to the domain
factor $d$, aiming to decompose the domain-class correlation. To achieve this
goal, we proposed estimating the resulting representation $z^{*}$ caused by the
intervention through first- and second-order statistical characteristic
matching. Specifically, we build a memory bank to restore the statistical
characteristics of each domain. Then, we use the newly generated samples
$\{z^{*},y,d^{*}\}$ to compute the loss function. These samples are
domain-class correlation decomposed; thus, we can learn a domain-invariant
representation that can capture more class-related features. Extensive
experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the
large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark.</span>

that draw upon the content of 3D models of urban scenes. Such 3D models can be
used to visualize city images at multiple scales from individual buildings to
entire cities prior to and after a change has occurred. This ability is of
great importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by
planners, geo-designers, and architects. In this research, we implemented a
novel approach to 3D building models for such matter, which included the
integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer Graphics
(3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints
(polygons), and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries
for rapid roof area damage reporting. These polygons (footprints) are usually
orthogonal. A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of
rectangles. The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal
building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and
box-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing
these polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all
building polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of boxes as
building bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps
between these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our
proposal, after approximately orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and
rectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles, each rectangle knows
which rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,
which will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building
bodies combined.</span>

or overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of
robust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A
prominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by
curriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the &#x60;small loss trick&#x27;
wherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are
selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and
it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also
require information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable
in practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample
selection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch
to provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any
additional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information
on noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.</span>

vasculature allows to navigate endovascular devices in minimally invasive
neuro-vascular treatment, while reducing the usage of harmful iodine contrast
medium. The alignment of the fluoroscopy images and the 3D reconstruction is
initialized using the sensor information of the X-ray C-arm geometry. Patient
motion is then corrected by an image-based registration algorithm, based on a
gradient difference similarity measure using digital reconstructed radiographs
of the 3D reconstruction. This algorithm does not require the vessels in the
fluoroscopy image to be filled with iodine contrast agent, but rather relies on
gradients in the image (bone structures, sinuses) as landmark features. This
paper investigates the accuracy, robustness and computation time aspects of the
image-based registration algorithm. Using phantom experiments 97% of the
registration attempts passed the success criterion of a residual registration
error of less than 1 mm translation and 3{\deg} rotation. The paper establishes
a new method for validation of 2D-3D registration without requiring changes to
the clinical workflow, such as attaching fiducial markers. As a consequence,
this method can be retrospectively applied to pre-existing clinical data. For

                                        <span>Inverse rendering is the problem of decomposing an image into its intrinsic
components, i.e. albedo, normal and lighting. To solve this ill-posed problem
from single image, state-of-the-art methods in shape from shading mostly resort
to supervised training on all the components on either synthetic or real
datasets. Here, we propose a new self-supervised training paradigm that 1)
reduces the need for full supervision on the decomposition task and 2) takes
into account the relighting task. We introduce new self-supervised loss terms
that leverage the consistencies between multi-lit images (images of the same
scene under different illuminations). Our approach is applicable to multi-lit
datasets. We apply our training approach in two settings: 1) train on a mixture
of synthetic and real data, 2) train on real datasets with limited supervision.
We show-case the effectiveness of our training paradigm on both intrinsic
decomposition and relighting and demonstrate how the model struggles in both
tasks without the self-supervised loss terms in limited supervision settings.
We provide results of comprehensive experiments on SfSNet, CelebA and Photoface
datasets and verify the performance of our approach on images in the wild.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks have been highly successful in image-based
learning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has
generalized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural
network to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized
convolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra
convolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of
functions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for
traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions
are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian
homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant
function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,
generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra
expansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional
convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads
to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated
VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative
to baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet
performance, we present several real data experiments involving classification

                                        <span>In sparse coding, we attempt to extract features of input vectors, assuming
that the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic
building blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning
features of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven
feature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved
remarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow
to be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.
We propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding
algorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code
within 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the
observation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global
thresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local
receptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural
inclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can
rely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during
training. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined
dictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as
a neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance
of the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in
both synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees
for a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions
the true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.</span>

photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site
measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we
present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their
location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar
radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve
semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a
machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof
pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of
solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches.
Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar
irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a
rooftop.</span>

like deep learning, have helped the automatic grading of colorectal
adenocarcinoma cancer (CRA). Present automated CRA grading methods, however,
usually use tiny image patches and thus fail to integrate the entire tissue
micro-architecture for grading purposes. To tackle these challenges, we propose
to use a statistical network analysis method to describe the complex structure
of the tissue micro-environment by modelling nuclei and their connections as a
network. We show that by analyzing only the interactions between the cells in a
network, we can extract highly discriminative statistical features for CRA
grading. Unlike other deep learning or convolutional graph-based approaches,
our method is highly scalable (can be used for cell networks consist of
millions of nodes), completely explainable, and computationally inexpensive. We
create cell networks on a broad CRC histology image dataset, experiment with
our method, and report state-of-the-art performance for the prediction of
three-class CRA grading.</span>

population dynamics is essential in conservation efforts; however, tracking
elephants is a difficult task, usually relying on the invasive and sometimes
dangerous placement of GPS collars. Although there have been many recent
successes in the use of computer vision techniques for automated identification
of other species, identification of elephants is extremely difficult and

                                        <span>Face sketch synthesis has made significant progress with the development of
deep neural networks in these years. The delicate depiction of sketch portraits
facilitates a wide range of applications like digital entertainment and law
enforcement. However, accurate and realistic face sketch generation is still a
challenging task due to the illumination variations and complex backgrounds in
the real scenes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Semantic-Driven
Generative Adversarial Network (SDGAN) which embeds global structure-level
style injection and local class-level knowledge re-weighting. Specifically, we
conduct facial saliency detection on the input face photos to provide overall
facial texture structure, which could be used as a global type of prior
information. In addition, we exploit face parsing layouts as the semantic-level
spatial prior to enforce globally structural style injection in the generator
of SDGAN. Furthermore, to enhance the realistic effect of the details, we
propose a novel Adaptive Re-weighting Loss (ARLoss) which dedicates to balance
the contributions of different semantic classes. Experimentally, our extensive
experiments on CUFS and CUFSF datasets show that our proposed algorithm

virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy
concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other
hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual
background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to
understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays
an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different
kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set
of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint.
In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether
a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the
first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search
for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm
that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector
against different kinds of attacks. This work&#x27;s performance is especially
noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance
especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing,
like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG

quantitatively using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics, and also compared
with an existing approach based on traditional computer vision techniques. The
best performing architectures generally produced good enhancement compared to
the existing algorithm, showing that it is possible to use DNNs for document

a baseline for future investigations on document enhancement using deep

                                        <span>Temporal action detection (TAD) is a challenging task which aims to
temporally localize and recognize the human action in untrimmed videos. Current
mainstream one-stage TAD approaches localize and classify action proposals
relying on pre-defined anchors, where the location and scale for action
instances are set by designers. Obviously, such an anchor-based TAD method
limits its generalization capability and will lead to performance degradation
when videos contain rich action variation. In this study, we explore to remove
the requirement of pre-defined anchors for TAD methods. A novel TAD model
termed as Selective Receptive Field Network (SRF-Net) is developed, in which
the location offsets and classification scores at each temporal location can be
directly estimated in the feature map and SRF-Net is trained in an end-to-end
manner. Innovatively, a building block called Selective Receptive Field
Convolution (SRFC) is dedicatedly designed which is able to adaptively adjust
its receptive field size according to multiple scales of input information at
each temporal location in the feature map. Extensive experiments are conducted
on the THUMOS14 dataset, and superior results are reported comparing to
state-of-the-art TAD approaches.</span>

fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation challenge, without
any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A
cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that
generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion
model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution
diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution
details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies
crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data
augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the
super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation
prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to
train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at

                                        <span>3D LiDAR (light detection and ranging) based semantic segmentation is
important in scene understanding for many applications, such as auto-driving
and robotics. For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and
LiDAR, it is crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors
for robust and accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however,
may not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between two
modalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called
perception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information
from two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and
spatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point
clouds to the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB
images. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two
modalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based
fusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to
measure the great perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For
example, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8%
in mIoU.</span>

spatially-variant photorealistic 3D rendering, a desirable property for mobile
augmented reality applications. However, in practice, estimating
omnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial
panoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and
mobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements
in mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep
learning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and
understand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in
this work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile
AR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting
estimation in real time. Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique
that efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile
device. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent
3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting
estimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored
GPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique
that reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive
triggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations
and a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the
mobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time
of Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe&#x27;s APIs. Our
results show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and
achieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural
network.</span>

                                        <span>Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding
environment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception
methods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and
pictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.
However, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its
infancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent
years. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception
mechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this
fact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and
depth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed
new network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only
used a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and
a semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the
output of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison
between the developed network and original network showed that our novel
structures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\% of relative
error of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were
carried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to
isolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and
semantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular
synthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an
appropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these
cases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against
domain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.</span>

diagnosis, and automated WSI analysis is key for computer-aided diagnosis.
Currently, analyzing the integrated descriptor of probabilities or feature maps
from massive local patches encoded by ResNet classifier is the main manner for
WSI-level prediction. Feature representations of the sparse and tiny lesion
cells in cervical slides, however, are still challengeable for the
under-promoted upstream encoders, while the unused spatial representations of
cervical cells are the available features to supply the semantics analysis. As
well as patches sampling with overlap and repetitive processing incur the
inefficiency and the unpredictable side effect. This study designs a novel
inline connection network (InCNet) by enriching the multi-scale connectivity to
build the lightweight model named You Only Look Cytopathology Once (YOLCO) with
the additional supervision of spatial information. The proposed model allows
the input size enlarged to megapixel that can stitch the WSI without any
overlap by the average repeats decreased from $10^3\sim10^4$ to $10^1\sim10^2$
for collecting features and predictions at two scales. Based on Transformer for

image reconstruction network named IREM, which is trained on multiple
low-resolution (LR) MR images and achieve an arbitrary up-sampling rate for HR
image reconstruction. In this work, we suppose the desired HR image as an
implicit continuous function of the 3D image spatial coordinate and the
thick-slice LR images as several sparse discrete samplings of this function.
Then the super-resolution (SR) task is to learn the continuous volumetric
function from a limited observations using an fully-connected neural network
combined with Fourier feature positional encoding. By simply minimizing the
error between the network prediction and the acquired LR image intensity across
each imaging plane, IREM is trained to represent a continuous model of the
observed tissue anatomy. Experimental results indicate that IREM succeeds in
representing high frequency image feature, and in real scene data collection,
IREM reduces scan time and achieves high-quality high-resolution MR imaging in

studies how to colourise greyscale images (for restoration). Deep learning
techniques improved image colourisation yielding astonishing results. These
differ by various factors, such as structural differences, input types, user
assistance, etc. Most of them, base the architectural structure on
convolutional layers with no emphasis on layers specialised in object features
extraction. We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named
TUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers
and capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every
single image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by
skip and residual connections. We pose the problem as a per pixel colour
classification task that identifies colours as a bin in a quantized space. To
train the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we
propose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by
only manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this
scheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images
and progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training
phase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach
with ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality
metrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation. We
performed a user study to quantify the perceptual realism of the colourisation
results demonstrating: that progressive learning let the TUCaN achieve better

                                        <span>Semi-supervised learning is a challenging problem which aims to construct a
model by learning from a limited number of labeled examples. Numerous methods
have been proposed to tackle this problem, with most focusing on utilizing the
predictions of unlabeled instances consistency alone to regularize networks.
However, treating labeled and unlabeled data separately often leads to the
discarding of mass prior knowledge learned from the labeled examples, and
failure to mine the feature interaction between the labeled and unlabeled image
pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic
segmentation named GuidedMix-Net, by leveraging labeled information to guide
the learning of unlabeled instances. Specifically, we first introduce a feature
alignment objective between labeled and unlabeled data to capture potentially
similar image pairs and then generate mixed inputs from them. The proposed
mutual information transfer (MITrans), based on the cluster assumption, is
shown to be a powerful knowledge module for further progressive refining
features of unlabeled data in the mixed data space. To take advantage of the
labeled examples and guide unlabeled data learning, we further propose a mask
generation module to generate high-quality pseudo masks for the unlabeled data.
Along with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled
data is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data.
Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes
demonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU by +7$\%$ compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                                        <span>One essential problem in skeleton-based action recognition is how to extract
discriminative features over all skeleton joints. However, the complexity of
the recent State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models for this task tends to be exceedingly
sophisticated and over-parameterized. The low efficiency in model training and
inference has increased the validation costs of model architectures in
large-scale datasets. To address the above issue, recent advanced separable
convolutional layers are embedded into an early fused Multiple Input Branches
(MIB) network, constructing an efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
baseline for skeleton-based action recognition. In addition, based on such the
baseline, we design a compound scaling strategy to expand the model&#x27;s width and
depth synchronously, and eventually obtain a family of efficient GCN baselines
with high accuracies and small amounts of trainable parameters, termed
EfficientGCN-Bx, where &#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27; denotes the scaling coefficient. On two
large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, the proposed EfficientGCN-B4
baseline outperforms other SOTA methods, e.g., achieving 91.7% accuracy on the
cross-subject benchmark of NTU 60 dataset, while being 3.15x smaller and 3.21x
faster than MS-G3D, which is one of the best SOTA methods. The source code in

classes simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We
are interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through
representation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled
classes, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel
classes. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning
approach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the
compositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on
heterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to
estimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled
examples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes
effectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint
optimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as
learning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable performance gains by the proposed
approach in multiple image retrieval and novel class discovery benchmarks.</span>

agent-object (e.g., human-object, hand-object, robot-object) interaction in
computer vision and robotics, very few past works have studied the task of
object-object interaction, which also plays an important role in robotic
manipulation and planning tasks. There is a rich space of object-object
interaction scenarios in our daily life, such as placing an object on a messy
tabletop, fitting an object inside a drawer, pushing an object using a tool,
etc. In this paper, we propose a unified affordance learning framework to learn
object-object interaction for various tasks. By constructing four object-object
interaction task environments using physical simulation (SAPIEN) and thousands
of ShapeNet models with rich geometric diversity, we are able to conduct
large-scale object-object affordance learning without the need for human
annotations or demonstrations. At the core of technical contribution, we
propose an object-kernel point convolution network to reason about detailed
interaction between two objects. Experiments on large-scale synthetic data and
real-world data prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Please refer

mobile devices in today&#x27;s world. In recent studies, however, deep learning
models are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. One variant of adversarial
examples, called adversarial patch, draws researchers&#x27; attention due to its
strong attack abilities. Though adversarial patches achieve high attack success
rates, they are easily being detected because of the visual inconsistency
between the patches and the original images. Besides, it usually requires a
large amount of data for adversarial patch generation in the literature, which
is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we
propose an approach to generate inconspicuous adversarial patches with one
single image. In our approach, we first decide the patch locations basing on
the perceptual sensitivity of victim models, then produce adversarial patches
in a coarse-to-fine way by utilizing multiple-scale generators and
discriminators. The patches are encouraged to be consistent with the background
images with adversarial training while preserving strong attack abilities. Our
approach shows the strong attack abilities in white-box settings and the
excellent transferability in black-box settings through extensive experiments
on various models with different architectures and training methods. Compared
to other adversarial patches, our adversarial patches hold the most negligible
risks to be detected and can evade human observations, which is supported by
the illustrations of saliency maps and results of user evaluations. Lastly, we
show that our adversarial patches can be applied in the physical world.</span>

given labelled examples of other classes. We present a new approach called
AutoNovel to address this problem by combining three ideas: (1) we suggest that
the common approach of bootstrapping an image representation using the labelled
data only introduces an unwanted bias, and that this can be avoided by using
self-supervised learning to train the representation from scratch on the union
of labelled and unlabelled data; (2) we use ranking statistics to transfer the
model&#x27;s knowledge of the labelled classes to the problem of clustering the
unlabelled images; and, (3) we train the data representation by optimizing a
joint objective function on the labelled and unlabelled subsets of the data,
improving both the supervised classification of the labelled data, and the
clustering of the unlabelled data. Moreover, we propose a method to estimate
the number of classes for the case where the number of new categories is not
known a priori. We evaluate AutoNovel on standard classification benchmarks and
substantially outperform current methods for novel category discovery. In
addition, we also show that AutoNovel can be used for fully unsupervised image
clustering, achieving promising results.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks can be converted to multi-exit architectures by
inserting early exit branches after some of their intermediate layers. This
allows their inference process to become dynamic, which is useful for time
critical IoT applications with stringent latency requirements, but with
time-variant communication and computation resources. In particular, in edge
computing systems and IoT networks where the exact computation time budget is
variable and not known beforehand. Vision Transformer is a recently proposed
architecture which has since found many applications across various domains of
computer vision. In this work, we propose seven different architectures for
early exit branches that can be used for dynamic inference in Vision
Transformer backbones. Through extensive experiments involving both
classification and regression problems, we show that each one of our proposed
architectures could prove useful in the trade-off between accuracy and speed.</span>

role in video understanding. Modelling the interactions (either spatial or
temporal) between actors and their context has proven to be essential for this
task. While recent works use spatial features with aggregated temporal
information, this work proposes to use non-aggregated temporal information.
This is done by adding an attention based method that leverages spatio-temporal
interactions between elements in the scene along the clip.The main contribution
of this work is the introduction of two cross attention blocks to effectively
model the spatial relations and capture short range temporal
interactions.Experiments on the AVA dataset show the advantages of the proposed
approach that models spatio-temporal relations between relevant elements in the
scene, outperforming other methods that model actor interactions with their
context by +0.31 mAP.</span>

this task because movie posters can represent time periods by using their

                                        <span>Attention Mechanism is a widely used method for improving the performance of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computer vision tasks. Despite its
pervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems
from. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual
attention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data
rather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is
only a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their
importance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication
in attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map
multiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order
non-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a
regularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable
landscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and
stability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,
and make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed
effectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map
multiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in
ResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various
datasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role
in improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism
in existing methods.</span>

reasoning about the inherent uncertainty in goals and driving behavior. This
uncertainty can be loosely decoupled into lateral (e.g., keeping lane, turning)
and longitudinal (e.g., accelerating, braking). We present a novel method that
combines learned discrete policy rollouts with a focused decoder on subsets of
the lane graph. The policy rollouts explore different goals given our current
observations, ensuring that the model captures lateral variability. The
longitudinal variability is captured by our novel latent variable model decoder
that is conditioned on various subsets of the lane graph. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes motion prediction dataset, and
qualitatively demonstrates excellent scene compliance. Detailed ablations
highlight the importance of both the policy rollouts and the decoder

Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to improve the wide variety of applications that
exploit this architecture. The first main contribution is an analysis of cGANs
to show that they are not explicitly conditional. In particular, it will be
shown that the discriminator and subsequently the cGAN does not automatically
learn the conditionality between inputs. The second contribution is a new
method, called acontrario, that explicitly models conditionality for both parts
of the adversarial architecture via a novel acontrario loss that involves
training the discriminator to learn unconditional (adverse) examples. This
leads to a novel type of data augmentation approach for GANs (acontrario
learning) which allows to restrict the search space of the generator to
conditional outputs using adverse examples. Extensive experimentation is
carried out to evaluate the conditionality of the discriminator by proposing a
probability distribution analysis. Comparisons with the cGAN architecture for
different applications show significant improvements in performance on well

                                        <span>Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity
authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and
stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these
models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models
using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has
limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing
transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.
However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and
degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting
to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial
patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by
generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like
features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we
show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target
models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive
digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the
physical world as well.</span>

                                        <span>This paper studies construction of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction maps
from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve
traditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited
amount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from
airborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.
Therefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate
response variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This
increases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression
function between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix
convolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based
AGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions
retrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the
same area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture
characteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided
generative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.
Further research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale
and low-cost predictions of AGB.</span>

strides in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks, such as object
and speech recognition. Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity
devices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple
performance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high
accuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the
various embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to
witness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
across consumer devices. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this
potentially game-changing question by presenting an array of design techniques
for efficient AI systems. We start by examining the major roadblocks when
targeting both programmable processors and custom accelerators. Then, we
present diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a
cross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,
and their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems
that do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can
improve inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and
FPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI
applications, such as multi-DNN systems. Collectively, these results highlight
the critical need for further exploration as to how the various cross-stack
solutions can be best combined in order to bring the latest advances in deep

from documents, which initially aims to enhance the anonymization during the
data transmission. The concatenated fusion of original and preprocessed images
containing both printed texts and handwritten notes or signatures are fed into
the convolutional neural network, where the bounding boxes are learned to
detect the handwriting. Afterwards, the handwritten regions can be processed
(e.g. replaced with redacted signatures) to conceal the personally identifiable

Cascade R-CNN works at 10 fps on a GPU during the inference, which ensures the
enhanced anonymization with minimal computational overheads. Furthermore, the
impressive generalizability has been empirically showcased: the trained model
based on the English-dominant dataset works well on the fictitious unseen

                                        <span>The rapid rise of accessibility of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones pose a
threat to general security and confidentiality. Most of the commercially
available or custom-built drones are multi-rotors and are comprised of multiple
propellers. Since these propellers rotate at a high-speed, they are generally
the fastest moving parts of an image and cannot be directly &quot;seen&quot; by a
classical camera without severe motion blur. We utilize a class of sensors that
are particularly suitable for such scenarios called event cameras, which have a
high temporal resolution, low-latency, and high dynamic range.

In this paper, we model the geometry of a propeller and use it to generate
simulated events which are used to train a deep neural network called EVPropNet
to detect propellers from the data of an event camera. EVPropNet directly
transfers to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. We present
two applications of our network: (a) tracking and following an unmarked drone
and (b) landing on a near-hover drone. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate
the proposed approach in many real-world experiments with different propeller
shapes and sizes. Our network can detect propellers at a rate of 85.1% even
when 60% of the propeller is occluded and can run at upto 35Hz on a 2W power
budget. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based solution for
detecting propellers (to detect drones). Finally, our applications also show an
impressive success rate of 92% and 90% for the tracking and landing tasks
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>For distant iris recognition, a long focal length lens is generally used to
ensure the resolution ofiris images, which reduces the depth of field and leads
to potential defocus blur. To accommodate users at different distances, it is
necessary to control focus quickly and accurately. While for users in motion,
it is expected to maintain the correct focus on the iris area continuously. In
this paper, we introduced a novel rapid autofocus camera for active refocusing
ofthe iris area ofthe moving objects using a focus-tunable lens. Our end-to-end
computational algorithm can predict the best focus position from one single
blurred image and generate a lens diopter control signal automatically. This
scene-based active manipulation method enables real-time focus tracking of the
iris area ofa moving object. We built a testing bench to collect real-world
focal stacks for evaluation of the autofocus methods. Our camera has reached an
autofocus speed ofover 50 fps. The results demonstrate the advantages of our
proposed camera for biometric perception in static and dynamic scenes. The code

CCD-captured data, but detecting CRs in single-exposure images has remained
challenging. Conventional CR-detection algorithms require tuning multiple
parameters experimentally making it hard to automate across different
instruments or observation requests. Recent work using deep learning to train
CR-detection models has demonstrated promising results. However,
instrument-specific models suffer from performance loss on images from
ground-based facilities not included in the training data. In this work, we
present Cosmic-CoNN, a deep-learning framework designed to produce generic
CR-detection models. We build a large, diverse ground-based CR dataset
leveraging thousands of images from the Las Cumbres Observatory global
telescope network to produce a generic CR-detection model which achieves a
99.91% true-positive detection rate and maintains over 96.40% true-positive
rates on unseen data from Gemini GMOS-N/S, with a false-positive rate of 0.01%.
Apart from the open-source framework and dataset, we also build a suite of
tools including console commands, a web-based application, and Python APIs to

                                        <span>Class imbalance is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications such
as semantic segmentation. Specifically, uneven class distributions in a
training dataset often result in unsatisfactory performance on
under-represented classes. Many works have proposed to weight the standard
cross entropy loss function with pre-computed weights based on class
statistics, such as the number of samples and class margins. There are two
major drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes
can introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority
class is not necessarily a hard class. The consequence is low precision due to
excessive false positives. In this regard, we propose a hard-class mining loss
by reshaping the vanilla cross entropy loss such that it weights the loss for
each class dynamically based on instantaneous recall performance. We show that
the novel recall loss changes gradually between the standard cross entropy loss
and the inverse frequency weighted loss. Recall loss also leads to improved
mean accuracy while offering competitive mean Intersection over Union (IoU)
performance. On Synthia dataset, recall loss achieves 9% relative improvement
on mean accuracy with competitive mean IoU using DeepLab-ResNet18 compared to
the cross entropy loss. Code available at

                                        <span>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has lately attracted increasing attention due to its
vital role in securing face recognition systems from presentation attacks
(PAs). As more and more realistic PAs with novel types spring up, traditional
FAS methods based on handcrafted features become unreliable due to their
limited representation capacity. With the emergence of large-scale academic
datasets in the recent decade, deep learning based FAS achieves remarkable
performance and dominates this area. However, existing reviews in this field
mainly focus on the handcrafted features, which are outdated and uninspiring
for the progress of FAS community. In this paper, to stimulate future research,
we present the first comprehensive review of recent advances in deep learning
based FAS. It covers several novel and insightful components: 1) besides
supervision with binary label (e.g., &#x27;0&#x27; for bonafide vs. &#x27;1&#x27; for PAs), we also
investigate recent methods with pixel-wise supervision (e.g., pseudo depth
map); 2) in addition to traditional intra-dataset evaluation, we collect and
analyze the latest methods specially designed for domain generalization and
open-set FAS; and 3) besides commercial RGB camera, we summarize the deep
learning applications under multi-modal (e.g., depth and infrared) or
specialized (e.g., light field and flash) sensors. We conclude this survey by
emphasizing current open issues and highlighting potential prospects.</span>

                                        <span>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that
records neural activations in the brain by capturing the blood oxygen level in
different regions based on the task performed by a subject. Given fMRI data,
the problem of predicting the state of cognitive fatigue in a person has not
been investigated to its full extent. This paper proposes tackling this issue
as a multi-class classification problem by dividing the state of cognitive
fatigue into six different levels, ranging from no-fatigue to extreme fatigue
conditions. We built a spatio-temporal model that uses convolutional neural
networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and a long short-term memory
(LSTM) network for temporal modeling of 4D fMRI scans. We also applied a
self-supervised method called MoCo to pre-train our model on a public dataset
BOLD5000 and fine-tuned it on our labeled dataset to classify cognitive
fatigue. Our novel dataset contains fMRI scans from Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI) patients and healthy controls (HCs) while performing a series of
cognitive tasks. This method establishes a state-of-the-art technique to
analyze cognitive fatigue from fMRI data and beats previous approaches to solve
this problem.</span>

development. However, mobile systems on self-driving cars with limited
computation resources lead to difficulties for object detection. To facilitate
this, we propose a compiler-aware neural pruning search framework to achieve
high-speed inference on autonomous vehicles for 2D and 3D object detection. The
framework automatically searches the pruning scheme and rate for each layer to
find a best-suited pruning for optimizing detection accuracy and speed
performance under compiler optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that for
the first time, the proposed method achieves (close-to) real-time, 55ms and
99ms inference times for YOLOv4 based 2D object detection and PointPillars

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have emerged as very successful tools for image
restoration and reconstruction tasks. These networks are often trained
end-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted
measurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on
large and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often
difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images.
Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems,
in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI
reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training
data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically
designed to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as
naive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through
extensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data
regime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the
art while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data
regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA can
improve the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test
distribution.</span>

                                        <span>Novel view synthesis is a long-standing problem in machine learning and
computer vision. Significant progress has recently been made in developing
neural scene representations and rendering techniques that synthesize
photorealistic images from arbitrary views. These representations, however, are
extremely slow to train and often also slow to render. Inspired by neural
variants of image-based rendering, we develop a new neural rendering approach
with the goal of quickly learning a high-quality representation which can also
be rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a
unique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image
feature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation
convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural
shape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape
and image features can then be extracted using traditional graphics techniques
and rendered in real time. We show that MetaNLR++ achieves similar or better
novel view synthesis results in a fraction of the time that competing methods
require.</span>

                                        <span>Text summarization is an approach for identifying important information
present within text documents. This computational technique aims to generate
shorter versions of the source text, by including only the relevant and salient
information present within the source text. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to summarize a text document by clustering its contents based on latent
topics produced using topic modeling techniques and by generating extractive
summaries for each of the identified text clusters. All extractive
sub-summaries are later combined to generate a summary for any given source
document. We utilize the lesser used and challenging WikiHow dataset in our
approach to text summarization. This dataset is unlike the commonly used news
datasets which are available for text summarization. The well-known news
datasets present their most important information in the first few lines of
their source texts, which make their summarization a lesser challenging task
when compared to summarizing the WikiHow dataset. Contrary to these news
datasets, the documents in the WikiHow dataset are written using a generalized
approach and have lesser abstractedness and higher compression ratio, thus
proposing a greater challenge to generate summaries. A lot of the current
state-of-the-art text summarization techniques tend to eliminate important
information present in source documents in the favor of brevity. Our proposed
technique aims to capture all the varied information present in source
documents. Although the dataset proved challenging, after performing extensive
tests within our experimental setup, we have discovered that our model produces
encouraging ROUGE results and summaries when compared to the other published
extractive and abstractive text summarization models.</span>

consumer service platform provides users with software to consume service to
the nearby store or to the home, such as Groupon and Koubei. Different from
other common e-commerce platforms, the behavior of users on the local consumer
service platform is closely related to their real-time local context
information. Therefore, building a context-aware user behavior prediction
system is able to provide both merchants and users better service in local
consumer service platforms. However, most of the previous work just treats the
contextual information as an ordinary feature into the prediction model to
obtain the prediction list under a specific context, which ignores the fact
that the interest of a user in different contexts is often significantly
different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a context-aware heterogeneous graph
attention network (CHGAT) to dynamically generate the representation of the
user and to estimate the probability for future behavior. Specifically, we
first construct the meta-path based heterogeneous graphs with the historical
behaviors from multiple sources and comprehend heterogeneous vertices in the
graph with a novel unified knowledge representing approach. Next, a multi-level
attention mechanism is introduced for context-aware aggregation with graph
vertices, which contains the vertex-level attention network and the path-level
attention network. Both of them aim to capture the semantic correlation between
information contained in the graph and the outside real-time contextual
information in the search system. Then the model proposed in this paper
aggregates specific graphs with their corresponding context features and
obtains the representation of user interest under a specific context and input
it into the prediction network to finally obtain the predicted probability of
user behavior.</span>

to meet the requirements of customers. One way how this research is conducted
is that a domain expert gathers and categorizes user-generated content into a
complex and fine-grained class structure. In many of such cases, little data
meets complex annotations. It is not yet fully understood how this can be
leveraged successfully for classification. We examine the classification
accuracy of expert labels when used with a) many fine-grained classes and b)
few abstract classes. For scenario b) we compare abstract class labels given by
the domain expert as baseline and by automatic hierarchical clustering. We
compare this to another baseline where the entire class structure is given by a
completely unsupervised clustering approach. By doing so, this work can serve
as an example of how complex expert annotations are potentially beneficial and
can be utilized in the most optimal way for opinion mining in highly specific
domains. By exploring across a range of techniques and experiments, we find
that automated class abstraction approaches in particular the unsupervised
approach performs remarkably well against domain expert baseline on text
classification tasks. This has the potential to inspire opinion mining

                                        <span>With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart
contracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which
makes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The
automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with
keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts
effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source
code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the
application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification
model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve
these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize
the model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart
contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code
and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good
resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,
our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract
classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.</span>

                                        <span>Near neighbor search (NNS) is a powerful abstraction for data access;
however, data indexing is troublesome even for approximate indexes. For
intrinsically high-dimensional data, high-quality fast searches demand either
indexes with impractically large memory usage or preprocessing time.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to solve a nearest-neighbor query
$q$ by minimizing a kernel function defined by the distance from $q$ to each
object in the database. The minimization is performed using metaheuristics to
solve the problem rapidly; even when some methods in the literature use this
strategy behind the scenes, our approach is the first one using it explicitly.
We also provide two approaches to select edges in the graph&#x27;s construction
stage that limit memory footprint and reduce the number of free parameters
simultaneously.

We carry out a thorough experimental comparison with state-of-the-art indexes
through synthetic and real-world datasets; we found out that our contributions
achieve competitive performances regarding speed, accuracy, and memory in
almost any of our benchmarks.</span>

combination with a network perspective. We argue that some of these
network-based rankings can produce misleading results. From a theoretical point
of view, we show that the standard network modelling approach of citation data
at the journal level (i.e., the projection of paper citations onto journals)
introduces fictitious relations among journals. To overcome this problem, we
propose a citation path perspective, and empirically show that rankings based
on the network and the citation path perspective are very different. Based on
our theoretical and empirical analysis, we highlight the limitations of
standard network metrics, and propose a method to overcome these limitations
and compute journal rankings.</span>

                                        <span>In quantum private information retrieval (QPIR), a user retrieves a classical
file from multiple servers by downloading quantum systems without revealing the
identity of the file. The QPIR capacity is the maximal achievable ratio of the
retrieved file size to the total download size. In this paper, the capacity of
QPIR from MDS-coded and colluding servers is studied. Two classes of QPIR,
called stabilizer QPIR and dimension squared QPIR induced from classical
strongly linear PIR are defined, and the related QPIR capacities are derived.
For the non-colluding case, the general QPIR capacity is derived when the
number of files goes to infinity. The capacities of symmetric and non-symmetric
QPIR with coded and colluding servers are proved to coincide, being double to
their classical counterparts. A general statement on the converse bound for
QPIR with coded and colluding servers is derived showing that the capacities of
stabilizer QPIR and dimension squared QPIR induced from any class of PIR are
upper bounded by twice the classical capacity of the respective PIR class. The
proposed capacity-achieving scheme combines the star-product scheme by
Freij-Hollanti et al. and the stabilizer QPIR scheme by Song et al. by
employing (weakly) self-dual Reed--Solomon codes.</span>

organizes respective tasks where different teams develop systems that are
evaluated on the same benchmark datasets that represent the real information
needs of experts in the biomedical domain. This paper presents an overview of
the ninth edition of the BioASQ challenge in the context of the Conference and
Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2021. In this year, a new question
answering task, named Synergy, is introduced to support researchers studying
the COVID-19 disease and measure the ability of the participating teams to
discern information while the problem is still developing. In total, 42 teams
with more than 170 systems were registered to participate in the four tasks of
the challenge. The evaluation results, similarly to previous years, show a
performance gain against the baselines which indicates the continuous
improvement of the state-of-the-art in this field.</span>

today&#x27;s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators --
tuned for low prediction latency -- preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii)~a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components
if they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and
real-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the
nominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these
findings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful
choice of each nominator&#x27;s training set is sometimes the only difference
between a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good
choice manually is difficult, we learn one instead. In particular, using a
Mixture-of-Experts approach, we train the nominators (experts) to specialize on
different subsets of the item pool. This significantly improves performance.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on the two smallest
normed division algebras, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Recent results suggest
that trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective
means to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on
real-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link
prediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution
operations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches
QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and
OMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous
state-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx. ConvQ and ConvO
build upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in a way
inspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on
seven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10.
Experimental results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued
vector representations become more apparent as the size and complexity of the
knowledge graph grows. ConvO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
FB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO
outperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in all metrics. Results also
suggest that link prediction performances can be further improved via
prediction averaging. To foster reproducible research, we provide an
open-source implementation of approaches, including training and evaluation
scripts as well as pretrained models.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamentally important to enable
intelligent cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. With recent advancement in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical
videos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary
knowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either
solely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal
representations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative
correlations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture
recognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of
multi-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate
visual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in
the latent feature space. In specific, we first extract embeddings from video
and kinematics sequences with temporal convolutional networks and LSTM units.
Next, we identify multi-relations in these multi-modal embeddings and leverage
them through a hierarchical relational graph learning module. The effectiveness
of our method is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on the public
JIGSAWS dataset, outperforming current uni-modal and multi-modal methods on
both suturing and knot typing tasks. Furthermore, we validated our method on
in-house visual-kinematics datasets collected with da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
platforms in two centers, with consistent promising performance achieved.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise of single-cell sequencing technologies, there is a growing need
for robust clustering algorithms to extract deeper insights from data. Here, we
introduce an intuitive and efficient clustering method, Forest Fire Clustering,
for discovering and validating cell types in single-cell sequencing analysis.
Compared to existing methods, our clustering algorithm makes minimum prior
assumptions about the data distribution and can provide a point-wise
significance value via Monte Carlo simulations for internal validation.
Additionally, point-wise label entropies can highlight novel transition cell
types \emph{de novo} along developmental pseudo-time manifolds. Lastly, our
inductive algorithm has the ability to make robust inferences in an
online-learning context. In this paper, we describe the method, provide a
summary of its performance against common clustering benchmarks, and
demonstrate that Forest Fire Clustering is uniquely suitable for single-cell
sequencing analysis.</span>

requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods
suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this
problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for
face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to
conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose
coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other
features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles
that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline,
through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users
to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could
achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage
of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For

obtained from crowdsourcing or Web scraping. We propose a new regularization
method, which enables learning robust classifiers in presence of noisy data. To
achieve this goal, we propose a new adversarial regularization scheme based on
the Wasserstein distance. Using this distance allows taking into account
specific relations between classes by leveraging the geometric properties of
the labels space. Our Wasserstein Adversarial Regularization (WAR) encodes a
selective regularization, which promotes smoothness of the classifier between
some classes, while preserving sufficient complexity of the decision boundary
between others. We first discuss how and why adversarial regularization can be
used in the context of label noise and then show the effectiveness of our
method on five datasets corrupted with noisy labels: in both benchmarks and
real datasets, WAR outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

dimensionality of the action-space or objective multiplicity grow very large.
This occurs, in part, because the variance on score-based gradient estimators
scales quadratically. In this paper, we address this problem through a causal
baseline which exploits independence structure encoded in a novel action-target
influence network. Causal policy gradients (CPGs), which follow, provide a
common framework for analysing key state-of-the-art algorithms, are shown to
generalise traditional policy gradients, and yield a principled way of
incorporating prior knowledge of a problem domain&#x27;s generative processes. We
provide an analysis of the proposed estimator and identify the conditions under
which variance is reduced. The algorithmic aspects of CPGs are discussed,
including optimal policy factorisation, as characterised by minimum biclique
coverings, and the implications for the bias-variance trade-off of incorrectly
specifying the network. Finally, we demonstrate the performance advantages of
our algorithm on large-scale bandit and traffic intersection problems,
providing a novel contribution to the latter in the form of a spatio-causal
approximation.</span>

interesting challenges for reinforcement learning agents. We focus here on the
problem of learning control flow that deviates from a strict step-by-step
execution of instructions -- that is, control flow that may skip forward over
parts of the instructions or return backward to previously completed or skipped
steps. Demand for such flexible control arises in two fundamental ways:
explicitly when control is specified in the instructions themselves (such as
conditional branching and looping) and implicitly when stochastic environment
dynamics require re-completion of instructions whose effects have been
perturbed, or opportunistic skipping of instructions whose effects are already
present. We formulate an attention-based architecture that meets these
challenges by learning, from task reward only, to flexibly attend to and
condition behavior on an internal encoding of the instructions. We test the
architecture&#x27;s ability to learn both explicit and implicit control in two
illustrative domains -- one inspired by Minecraft and the other by StarCraft --
and show that the architecture exhibits zero-shot generalization to novel
instructions of length greater than those in a training set, at a performance
level unmatched by two baseline recurrent architectures and one ablation
architecture.</span>

rate of the Broyden class of quasi-Newton methods including
Davidon--Fletcher--Powell (DFP) method and Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno
(BFGS) method. The asymptotic superlinear convergence rate of these
quasi-Newton methods has been extensively studied, but their explicit finite
time local convergence rate is not fully investigated. In this paper, we
provide a finite time (non-asymptotic) convergence analysis for BFGS and DFP
methods under the assumptions that the objective function is strongly convex,
its gradient is Lipschitz continuous, and its Hessian is Lipschitz continuous
only in the direction of the optimal solution. We show that in a local
neighborhood of the optimal solution, the iterates generated by both DFP and
BFGS converge to the optimal solution at a superlinear rate of $(1/k)^{k/2}$,
where $k$ is the number of iterations. We also prove the same local superlinear
convergence rate in the case that the objective function is self-concordant.
Numerical experiments on different objective functions confirm our explicit
convergence rates. Our theoretical guarantee is one of the first results that
provide a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate for DFP and BFGS
quasi-Newton methods.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric, flexible, models that work well
in many tasks. Combining GPs with deep learning methods via deep kernel
learning (DKL) is especially compelling due to the strong representational
power induced by the network. However, inference in GPs, whether with or
without DKL, can be computationally challenging on large datasets. Here, we
propose GP-Tree, a novel method for multi-class classification with Gaussian
processes and DKL. We develop a tree-based hierarchical model in which each
internal node of the tree fits a GP to the data using the P\&#x27;olya Gamma
augmentation scheme. As a result, our method scales well with both the number
of classes and data size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
against other Gaussian process training baselines, and we show how our general
GP approach achieves improved accuracy on standard incremental few-shot
learning benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Scalable Gaussian Process methods are computationally attractive, yet
introduce modeling biases that require rigorous study. This paper analyzes two
common techniques: early truncated conjugate gradients (CG) and random Fourier
features (RFF). We find that both methods introduce a systematic bias on the
learned hyperparameters: CG tends to underfit while RFF tends to overfit. We
address these issues using randomized truncation estimators that eliminate bias
in exchange for increased variance. In the case of RFF, we show that the
bias-to-variance conversion is indeed a trade-off: the additional variance
proves detrimental to optimization. However, in the case of CG, our unbiased
learning procedure meaningfully outperforms its biased counterpart with minimal
additional computation.</span>

from controlling the $\ell_2$ norm of the weights in linear convolutional
networks. We view this in terms of an induced regularizer in the function space
given by the minimum norm of weights required to realize a linear function. For
two layer linear convolutional networks with $C$ output channels and kernel
size $K$, we show the following: (a) If the inputs to the network have a single
channel, the induced regularizer for any $K$ is a norm given by a semidefinite
program (SDP) that is independent of the number of output channels $C$. (b) In
contrast, for networks with multi-channel inputs, multiple output channels can
be necessary to merely realize all matrix-valued linear functions and thus the
inductive bias does depend on $C$. Further, for sufficiently large $C$, the
induced regularizer for $K&#x3D;1$ and $K&#x3D;D$ are the nuclear norm and the
$\ell_{2,1}$ group-sparse norm, respectively, of the Fourier coefficients. (c)
Complementing our theoretical results, we show through experiments on MNIST and

                                        <span>This paper addresses the growing need to process non-Euclidean data, by
introducing a geometric deep learning (GDL) framework for building universal
feedforward-type models compatible with differentiable manifold geometries. We
show that our GDL models can approximate any continuous target function
uniformly on compacts of a controlled maximum diameter. We obtain curvature
dependant lower-bounds on this maximum diameter and upper-bounds on the depth
of our approximating GDL models. Conversely, we find that there is always a
continuous function between any two non-degenerate compact manifolds that any
&quot;locally-defined&quot; GDL model cannot uniformly approximate. Our last main result
identifies data-dependent conditions guaranteeing that the GDL model
implementing our approximation breaks &quot;the curse of dimensionality.&quot; We find
that any &quot;real-world&quot; (i.e. finite) dataset always satisfies our condition and,
conversely, any dataset satisfies our requirement if the target function is
smooth. As applications, we confirm the universal approximation capabilities of
the following GDL models: Ganea et al. (2018)&#x27;s hyperbolic feedforward
networks, the architecture implementing Krishnan et al. (2015)&#x27;s deep
Kalman-Filter, and deep softmax classifiers. We build universal
extensions/variants of: the SPD-matrix regressor of Meyer et al. (2011), and
Fletcher et al. (2009)&#x27;s Procrustean regressor. In the Euclidean setting, our
results imply a quantitative version of Kidger and Lyons (2020)&#x27;s approximation
theorem and a data-dependent version of Yarotsky and Zhevnerchuk (2020)&#x27;s

                                        <span>Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an
effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art
performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed
radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the
loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and
generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive
sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization
bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware
minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental
results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant
improvement of model generalization performance.</span>

levels comparable to human transcribers, which led researchers to debate if the
machine has reached human performance. Previous work focused on the English
language and modular hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN) systems.
In this paper, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking for end-to-end
transformer ASR, modular HMM-DNN ASR, and human speech recognition (HSR) on the
Arabic language and its dialects. For the HSR, we evaluate linguist performance
and lay-native speaker performance on a new dataset collected as a part of this
study. For ASR the end-to-end work led to 12.5%, 27.5%, 33.8% WER; a new
performance milestone for the MGB2, MGB3, and MGB5 challenges respectively. Our
results suggest that human performance in the Arabic language is still
considerably better than the machine with an absolute WER gap of 3.5% on

of signal parameters of discretely sampled signals. In particular, we use dense
autoencoder networks to extract the parameters of interest from exponentially
decaying signals and decaying oscillations. By using a three-stage training
method and careful choice of the neural network size, we are able to retrieve
the relevant signal parameters directly from the latent space of the
autoencoder network at significantly improved rates compared to traditional
algorithmic signal-analysis approaches. We show that the achievable precision
and accuracy of this method of analysis is similar to conventional
algorithm-based signal analysis methods, by demonstrating that the extracted
signal parameters are approaching their fundamental parameter estimation limit
as provided by the Cram\&#x27;er-Rao bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
autoencoder networks are able to achieve signal analysis, and, hence, parameter
extraction, at rates of 75 kHz, orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional
techniques with similar precision. Finally, we explore the limitations of our

                                        <span>Stochastic dual dynamic programming is a cutting plane type algorithm for
multi-stage stochastic optimization originated about 30 years ago. In spite of
its popularity in practice, there does not exist any analysis on the
convergence rates of this method. In this paper, we first establish the number
of iterations, i.e., iteration complexity, required by a basic dynamic cutting
plane method for solving relatively simple multi-stage optimization problems,
by introducing novel mathematical tools including the saturation of search
points. We then refine these basic tools and establish the iteration complexity
for both deterministic and stochastic dual dynamic programming methods for
solving more general multi-stage stochastic optimization problems under the
standard stage-wise independence assumption. Our results indicate that the
complexity of these methods mildly increases with the number of stages $T$, in
fact linearly dependent on $T$ for discounted problems. Therefore, they are
efficient for strategic decision making which involves a large number of
stages, but with a relatively small number of decision variables in each stage.
Without explicitly discretizing the state and action spaces, these methods
might also be pertinent to the related reinforcement learning and stochastic
control areas.</span>

                                        <span>Exoplanet detection in the past decade by efforts including NASA&#x27;s Kepler and
TESS missions has discovered many worlds that differ substantially from planets
in our own Solar system, including more than 400 exoplanets orbiting binary or
multi-star systems. This not only broadens our understanding of the diversity
of exoplanets, but also promotes our study of exoplanets in the complex binary
and multi-star systems and provides motivation to explore their habitability.
In this study, we analyze orbital stability of exoplanets in non-coplanar
circumbinary systems using a numerical simulation method, with which a large
number of circumbinary planet samples are generated in order to quantify the
effects of various orbital parameters on orbital stability. We also train a
machine learning model that can quickly determine the stability of the
circumbinary planetary systems. Our results indicate that larger inclinations
of the planet tend to increase the stability of its orbit, but change in the
planet&#x27;s mass range between Earth and Jupiter has little effect on the
stability of the system. In addition, we find that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
have higher accuracy and precision than other machine learning algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Many clustering algorithms are guided by certain cost functions such as the
widely-used $k$-means cost. These algorithms divide data points into clusters
with often complicated boundaries, creating difficulties in explaining the
clustering decision. In a recent work, Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and
Rashtchian (ICML&#x27;20) introduced explainable clustering, where the cluster
boundaries are axis-parallel hyperplanes and the clustering is obtained by
applying a decision tree to the data. The central question here is: how much
does the explainability constraint increase the value of the cost function?

Given $d$-dimensional data points, we show an efficient algorithm that finds
an explainable clustering whose $k$-means cost is at most $k^{1 -
2/d}\mathrm{poly}(d\log k)$ times the minimum cost achievable by a clustering
without the explainability constraint, assuming $k,d\ge 2$. Combining this with
an independent work by Makarychev and Shan (ICML&#x27;21), we get an improved bound
of $k^{1 - 2/d}\mathrm{polylog}(k)$, which we show is optimal for every choice
of $k,d\ge 2$ up to a poly-logarithmic factor in $k$. For $d &#x3D; 2$ in
particular, we show an $O(\log k\log\log k)$ bound, improving exponentially
over the previous best bound of $\widetilde O(k)$.</span>

space by an expansion over a dictionary $\mathbb{D}$. We introduce the notion
of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the
approximation rates, metric entropy and $n$-widths of the absolute convex hull,
which we denote $B_1(\mathbb{D})$, of such dictionaries. The upper bounds
depend upon the order of smoothness of the parameterization, and improve upon
existing results in many cases. The main applications of these results is to
the dictionaries $\mathbb{D} &#x3D; \{\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}\subset L^2$
corresponding to shallow neural networks with activation function $\sigma$, and
to the dictionary of decaying Fourier modes corresponding to the spectral
Barron space. This improves upon existing approximation rates for shallow
neural networks when $\sigma &#x3D; \text{ReLU}^k$ for $k\geq 2$, sharpens bounds on
the metric entropy, and provides the first bounds on the Gelfand $n$-widths of
the Barron space and spectral Barron space.</span>

demonstrate this with two applications, namely speech recognition and detecting
car driving maneuvers. We improve the state of the art by application-specific

detecting car driving maneuvers can be done without the commonly used

                                        <span>Decentralized learning enables a group of collaborative agents to learn
models using a distributed dataset without the need for a central parameter
server. Recently, decentralized learning algorithms have demonstrated
state-of-the-art results on benchmark data sets, comparable with centralized
algorithms. However, the key assumption to achieve competitive performance is
that the data is independently and identically distributed (IID) among the
agents which, in real-life applications, is often not applicable. Inspired by
ideas from continual learning, we propose Cross-Gradient Aggregation (CGA), a
novel decentralized learning algorithm where (i) each agent aggregates
cross-gradient information, i.e., derivatives of its model with respect to its
neighbors&#x27; datasets, and (ii) updates its model using a projected gradient
based on quadratic programming (QP). We theoretically analyze the convergence
characteristics of CGA and demonstrate its efficiency on non-IID data
distributions sampled from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our empirical
comparisons show superior learning performance of CGA over existing
state-of-the-art decentralized learning algorithms, as well as maintaining the
improved performance under information compression to reduce peer-to-peer
communication overhead. The code is available here on GitHub.</span>

as the gold standard. We present a new end-to-end differentiable method to
train a standard FFNN. Our method, \textbf{Muddling labels for Regularization}
(\texttt{MLR}), penalizes memorization through the generation of uninformative
labels and the application of a differentiable close-form regularization scheme
on the last hidden layer during training. \texttt{MLR} outperforms classical NN
and the gold standard (GBDT, RF) for regression and classification tasks on
several datasets from the UCI database and Kaggle covering a large range of

has adopted a diverse set of objectives, most research on off-policy evaluation
to date focuses on the expected reward. In this paper, we introduce Lipschitz
risk functionals, a broad class of objectives that subsumes conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR), variance, mean-variance, many distorted risks, and CPT
risks, among others. We propose Off-Policy Risk Assessment (OPRA), a framework
that first estimates a target policy&#x27;s CDF and then generates plugin estimates
for any collection of Lipschitz risks, providing finite sample guarantees that
hold simultaneously over the entire class. We instantiate OPRA with both
importance sampling and doubly robust estimators. Our primary theoretical
contributions are (i) the first uniform concentration inequalities for both CDF
estimators in contextual bandits and (ii) error bounds on our Lipschitz risk
estimates, which all converge at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$.</span>

without inductive biases on the models and the data. As an alternative
approach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors
of variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true
generative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we
argue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that
describe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for
disentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as
separating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly
specified. Our success in this challenging setting, demonstrated on synthetic
benchmarks, gives rise to leveraging off-the-shelf image descriptors to
partially annotate a subset of attributes in real image domains (e.g. of human
faces) with minimal manual effort. Specifically, we use a recent language-image
embedding model (CLIP) to annotate a set of attributes of interest in a
zero-shot manner and demonstrate state-of-the-art disentangled image
manipulation results.</span>

                                        <span>Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two
adjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two
adjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain
semantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use
optical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing
are indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex
problems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without
using problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep
neural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based
Generative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a
learning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain
semantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated
image is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an
invertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by
generative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.
Through experiments, we \sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed
algorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new
possibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful
in that it is the world&#x27;s first attempt to use invertible networks instead of
optical flows for video interpolation.</span>

                                        <span>Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects
such as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for
networks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised
network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without
external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the
local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI
for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node
classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI
merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information
between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal
(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).
Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges
with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various
relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a
novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning
node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more
specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic
and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we
propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision
signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node
embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering
and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.</span>

correspondence between two random graphs with correlated edges. This can be
viewed as an average-case and noisy version of the well-known graph isomorphism
problem. For the correlated Erd\&quot;os-R\&#x27;enyi model, we prove an impossibility
result for partial recovery in the sparse regime, with constant average degree
and correlation, as well as a general bound on the maximal reachable overlap.
Our bound is tight in the noiseless case (the graph isomorphism problem) and we
conjecture that it is still tight with noise. Our proof technique relies on a
careful application of the probabilistic method to build automorphisms between

                                        <span>Recently generating natural language explanations has shown very promising
results in not only offering interpretable explanations but also providing
additional information and supervision for prediction. However, existing
approaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for
training while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time
consuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for
interpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of
human annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural
language explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning
process of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for
optimization where an explanation generation module and an
explanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and
mutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based
self-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It
alternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new
explanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural
language understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make
effective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also
generate good natural language explanation.</span>

readings from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device is a problem of
great importance in diabetes care, and therefore, has attracted a lot of
research in recent years, especially based on machine learning. An accurate
prediction with a 30, 60, or 90 minute prediction horizon has the potential of
saving millions of dollars in emergency care costs. In this paper, we treat the
problem as one of function approximation, where the value of the BG level at
time $t+h$ (where $h$ the prediction horizon) is considered to be an unknown
function of $d$ readings prior to the time $t$. This unknown function may be
supported in particular on some unknown submanifold of the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space. While manifold learning is classically done in a
semi-supervised setting, where the entire data has to be known in advance, we
use recent ideas to achieve an accurate function approximation in a supervised
setting; i.e., construct a model for the target function. We use the
state-of-the-art clinically relevant PRED-EGA grid to evaluate our results, and
demonstrate that for a real life dataset, our method performs better than a
standard deep network, especially in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic regimes.
One noteworthy aspect of this work is that the training data and test data may
come from different distributions.</span>

learning and graph convolutional neural networks. Our approach is to
recursively partition coarser representations of a given graph. The neural
network is implemented using SAGE graph convolution layers, and trained using
an advantage actor critic (A2C) agent. We present two variants, one for finding
an edge separator that minimizes the normalized cut or quotient cut, and one
that finds a small vertex separator. The vertex separators are then used to
construct a nested dissection ordering to permute a sparse matrix so that its
triangular factorization will incur less fill-in. The partitioning quality is
compared with partitions obtained using METIS and SCOTCH, and the nested
dissection ordering is evaluated in the sparse solver SuperLU. Our results show
that the proposed method achieves similar partitioning quality as METIS and
SCOTCH. Furthermore, the method generalizes across different classes of graphs,
and works well on a variety of graphs from the SuiteSparse sparse matrix

(rs-fMRI) records the temporal dynamics of intrinsic functional networks in the
brain. However, existing deep learning methods applied to rs-fMRI either
neglect the functional dependency between different brain regions in a network
or discard the information in the temporal dynamics of brain activity. To
overcome those shortcomings, we propose to formulate functional connectivity
networks within the context of spatio-temporal graphs. We train a
spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) on short sub-sequences of
the BOLD time series to model the non-stationary nature of functional
connectivity. Simultaneously, the model learns the importance of graph edges
within ST-GCN to gain insight into the functional connectivities contributing
to the prediction. In analyzing the rs-fMRI of the Human Connectome Project
(HCP, N&#x3D;1,091) and the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in
Adolescence (NCANDA, N&#x3D;773), ST-GCN is significantly more accurate than common
approaches in predicting gender and age based on BOLD signals. Furthermore, the
brain regions and functional connections significantly contributing to the
predictions of our model are important markers according to the neuroscience
literature.</span>

importance for distributed and federated learning. In spite of this, we
identify severe flaws in existing algorithms even when the data across the
participants is identically distributed. First, we show realistic examples
where current state of the art robust aggregation rules fail to converge even
in the absence of any Byzantine attackers. Secondly, we prove that even if the
aggregation rules may succeed in limiting the influence of the attackers in a
single round, the attackers can couple their attacks across time eventually
leading to divergence. To address these issues, we present two surprisingly
simple strategies: a new robust iterative clipping procedure, and incorporating
worker momentum to overcome time-coupled attacks. This is the first provably
robust method for the standard stochastic optimization setting. Our code is

estimating the vibrational velocity field of a structure by means of acoustic

surface of arbitrary shaped plates (violin plates) with orthotropic material

vibrational field with a higher spatial resolution compared to the input
pressure. The pressure and velocity datasets have been generated through Finite

                                        <span>The Poisson equation is commonly encountered in engineering, for instance in
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) where it is needed to compute corrections to
the pressure field to ensure the incompressibility of the velocity field. In
the present work, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture to infer the solution of the Poisson equation on a 2D Cartesian
grid with different resolutions given the right hand side term, arbitrary
boundary conditions and grid parameters. It provides unprecedented versatility
for a CNN approach dealing with partial differential equations. The boundary
conditions are handled using a novel approach by decomposing the original
Poisson problem into a homogeneous Poisson problem plus four inhomogeneous
Laplace sub-problems. The model is trained using a novel loss function
approximating the continuous $L^p$ norm between the prediction and the target.
Even when predicting on grids denser than previously encountered, our model
demonstrates encouraging capacity to reproduce the correct solution profile.
The proposed model, which outperforms well-known neural network models, can be
included in a CFD solver to help with solving the Poisson equation. Analytical
test cases indicate that our CNN architecture is capable of predicting the
correct solution of a Poisson problem with mean percentage errors below 10%, an
improvement by comparison to the first step of conventional iterative methods.
Predictions from our model, used as the initial guess to iterative algorithms
like Multigrid, can reduce the RMS error after a single iteration by more than
90% compared to a zero initial guess.</span>

                                        <span>In the domain generalization literature, a common objective is to learn
representations independent of the domain after conditioning on the class
label. We show that this objective is not sufficient: there exist
counter-examples where a model fails to generalize to unseen domains even after
satisfying class-conditional domain invariance. We formalize this observation
through a structural causal model and show the importance of modeling
within-class variations for generalization. Specifically, classes contain
objects that characterize specific causal features, and domains can be
interpreted as interventions on these objects that change non-causal features.
We highlight an alternative condition: inputs across domains should have the
same representation if they are derived from the same object. Based on this
objective, we propose matching-based algorithms when base objects are observed
(e.g., through data augmentation) and approximate the objective when objects
are not observed (MatchDG). Our simple matching-based algorithms are
competitive to prior work on out-of-domain accuracy for rotated MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, PACS, and Chest-Xray datasets. Our method MatchDG also recovers
ground-truth object matches: on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, top-10 matches from
MatchDG have over 50% overlap with ground-truth matches.</span>

as the source and target, respectively, we exploit both the chain rule and
Bayes&#x27; theorem to construct conditional transport (CT), which is constituted by
both a forward component and a backward one. The forward CT is the expected
cost of moving a source data point to a target one, with their joint
distribution defined by the product of the source probability density function
(PDF) and a source-dependent conditional distribution, which is related to the
target PDF via Bayes&#x27; theorem. The backward CT is defined by reversing the
direction. The CT cost can be approximated by replacing the source and target
PDFs with their discrete empirical distributions supported on mini-batches,
making it amenable to implicit distributions and stochastic gradient
descent-based optimization. When applied to train a generative model, CT is
shown to strike a good balance between mode-covering and mode-seeking behaviors
and strongly resist mode collapse. On a wide variety of benchmark datasets for
generative modeling, substituting the default statistical distance of an
existing generative adversarial network with CT is shown to consistently
improve the performance. PyTorch-style code is provided.</span>

                                        <span>When studying the expressive power of neural networks, a main challenge is to
understand how the size and depth of the network affect its ability to
approximate real functions. However, not all functions are interesting from a
practical viewpoint: functions of interest usually have a polynomially-bounded
Lipschitz constant, and can be computed efficiently. We call functions that
satisfy these conditions &quot;benign&quot;, and explore the benefits of size and depth
for approximation of benign functions with ReLU networks. As we show, this
problem is more challenging than the corresponding problem for non-benign
functions. We give barriers to showing depth-lower-bounds: Proving existence of
a benign function that cannot be approximated by polynomial-size networks of
depth $4$ would settle longstanding open problems in computational complexity.
It implies that beyond depth $4$ there is a barrier to showing depth-separation
for benign functions, even between networks of constant depth and networks of
nonconstant depth. We also study size-separation, namely, whether there are
benign functions that can be approximated with networks of size $O(s(d))$, but
not with networks of size $O(s&#x27;(d))$. We show a complexity-theoretic barrier to
proving such results beyond size $O(d\log^2(d))$, but also show an explicit
benign function, that can be approximated with networks of size $O(d)$ and not
with networks of size $o(d/\log d)$. For approximation in $L_\infty$ we achieve
such separation already between size $O(d)$ and size $o(d)$. Moreover, we show
superpolynomial size lower bounds and barriers to such lower bounds, depending
on the assumptions on the function. Our size-separation results rely on an
analysis of size lower bounds for Boolean functions, which is of independent
interest: We show linear size lower bounds for computing explicit Boolean
functions with neural networks and threshold circuits.</span>

                                        <span>Despite of the pervasive existence of multi-label evasion attack, it is an
open yet essential problem to characterize the origin of the adversarial
vulnerability of a multi-label learning system and assess its attackability. In
this study, we focus on non-targeted evasion attack against multi-label
classifiers. The goal of the threat is to cause miss-classification with
respect to as many labels as possible, with the same input perturbation. Our
work gains in-depth understanding about the multi-label adversarial attack by
first characterizing the transferability of the attack based on the functional
properties of the multi-label classifier. We unveil how the transferability
level of the attack determines the attackability of the classifier via
establishing an information-theoretic analysis of the adversarial risk.
Furthermore, we propose a transferability-centered attackability assessment,
named Soft Attackability Estimator (SAE), to evaluate the intrinsic
vulnerability level of the targeted multi-label classifier. This estimator is
then integrated as a transferability-tuning regularization term into the
multi-label learning paradigm to achieve adversarially robust classification.
The experimental study on real-world data echos the theoretical analysis and
verify the validity of the transferability-regularized multi-label learning
method.</span>

dimensionality encountered in quantum physics, celebrated by the ability to
extract low-dimensional patterns from quantum states living in the
high-dimensional space. Despite its attractive properties, little is known
about the practical applications of QAE with provable advantages. To address
these issues, here we prove that QAE can be used to efficiently calculate the
eigenvalues and prepare the corresponding eigenvectors of a high-dimensional
quantum state with the low-rank property. With this regard, we devise three
effective QAE-based learning protocols to solve the low-rank state fidelity
estimation, the quantum Gibbs state preparation, and the quantum metrology
tasks, respectively. Notably, all of these protocols are scalable and can be
readily executed on near-term quantum machines. Moreover, we prove that the
error bounds of the proposed QAE-based methods outperform those in previous
literature. Numerical simulations collaborate with our theoretical analysis.
Our work opens a new avenue of utilizing QAE to tackle various quantum physics
and quantum information processing problems in a scalable way.</span>

datasets is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data,
dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the
characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited
capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is
designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that
most differentiate groups. In this work, we introduce an interactive DR
framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear
comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two
DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various
comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we
develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine
ULCA results. Additionally, we provide an interactive visualization interface
to examine ULCA results with a rich set of analysis libraries. We evaluate ULCA
and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present
multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness
of our framework.</span>

                                        <span>Conditional gradient methods have attracted much attention in both machine
learning and optimization communities recently. These simple methods can
guarantee the generation of sparse solutions. In addition, without the
computation of full gradients, they can handle huge-scale problems sometimes
even with an exponentially increasing number of decision variables. This paper
aims to significantly expand the application areas of these methods by
presenting new conditional gradient methods for solving convex optimization
problems with general affine and nonlinear constraints. More specifically, we
first present a new constraint extrapolated condition gradient (CoexCG) method
that can achieve an ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity for both
smooth and structured nonsmooth function constrained convex optimization. We
further develop novel variants of CoexCG, namely constraint extrapolated and
dual regularized conditional gradient (CoexDurCG) methods, that can achieve
similar iteration complexity to CoexCG but allow adaptive selection for
algorithmic parameters. We illustrate the effectiveness of these methods for
solving an important class of radiation therapy treatment planning problems
arising from healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, all the
algorithmic schemes and their complexity results are new in the area of
projection-free methods.</span>

recently. Existing studies address the problem using shallow learning
mechanisms such as subspace selection, ego-network, or community analysis.
These models do not take into account the multifaceted interactions between the
structure and attributes in the network. In this paper, we propose GraphAnoGAN,
an anomalous snapshot ranking framework, which consists of two core components
-- generative and discriminative models. Specifically, the generative model
learns to approximate the distribution of anomalous samples from the candidate
set of graph snapshots, and the discriminative model detects whether the
sampled snapshot is from the ground-truth or not. Experiments on 4 real-world
networks show that GraphAnoGAN outperforms 6 baselines with a significant
margin (28.29% and 22.01% higher precision and recall, respectively compared to

performant and flexible deployment policies that can readily incorporate
constraints during deployment. One such class of policies are the
semi-parametric H-step lookahead policies, which select actions using
trajectory optimization over a dynamics model for a fixed horizon with a
terminal value function. In this work, we investigate a novel instantiation of
H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal value function learned by
a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy with Online
Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, suggesting a
tradeoff between model errors and value function errors and empirically
demonstrate this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, we identify the &quot;Actor Divergence&quot; issue in this framework and
propose Actor Regularized Control (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization
procedure. We evaluate our method on a set of robotic tasks for Offline and
Online RL and demonstrate improved performance. We also show the flexibility of
LOOP to incorporate safety constraints during deployment with a set of
navigation environments. We demonstrate that LOOP is a desirable framework for
robotics applications based on its strong performance in various important RL
settings.</span>

contracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which
makes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The
automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with
keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts
effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source
code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the
application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification
model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve
these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize
the model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart
contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code
and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good
resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,
our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract
classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.</span>

Intelligence (AI) errors. Systematic re-training of a large AI system is hardly
possible. To solve this problem, special external devices, correctors, are
developed. They should provide quick and non-iterative system fix without
modification of a legacy AI system. A common universal part of the AI corrector
is a classifier that should separate undesired and erroneous behavior from
normal operation. Training of such classifiers is a grand challenge at the
heart of the one- and few-shot learning methods. Effectiveness of one- and
few-short methods is based on either significant dimensionality reductions or
the blessing of dimensionality effects. Stochastic separability is a blessing
of dimensionality phenomenon that allows one-and few-shot error correction: in
high-dimensional datasets under broad assumptions each point can be separated
from the rest of the set by simple and robust linear discriminant. The
hierarchical structure of data universe is introduced where each data cluster
has a granular internal structure, etc. New stochastic separation theorems for
the data distributions with fine-grained structure are formulated and proved.
Separation theorems in infinite-dimensional limits are proven under assumptions
of compact embedding of patterns into data space. New multi-correctors of AI
systems are presented and illustrated with examples of predicting errors and
learning new classes of objects by a deep convolutional neural network.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the empirical success of the deep Q network (DQN) reinforcement
learning algorithm and its variants, DQN is still not well understood and it
does not guarantee convergence. In this work, we show that DQN can diverge and
cease to operate in realistic settings. Although there exist gradient-based
convergent methods, we show that they actually have inherent problems in
learning behaviour and elucidate why they often fail in practice. To overcome
these problems, we propose a convergent DQN algorithm (C-DQN) by carefully
modifying DQN, and we show that the algorithm is convergent and can work with
large discount factors (0.9998). It learns robustly in difficult settings and
can learn several difficult games in the Atari 2600 benchmark where DQN fail,
within a moderate computational budget. Our codes have been publicly released
and can be used to reproduce our results.</span>

the success of downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering and data

                                        <span>Researchers have been battling with the question of how we can identify
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases efficiently, affordably and at scale.
Recent work has shown how audio based approaches, which collect respiratory
audio data (cough, breathing and voice) can be used for testing, however there
is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact
these tools&#x27; performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic
performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we
collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app,
alongside recent COVID-19 test result and symptoms intended as a ground truth.
Within the collected dataset, we selected 5,240 samples from 2,478 participants
and split them into different participant-independent sets for model
development and validation. Among these, we controlled for potential
confounding factors (such as demographics and language). The unbiased model
takes features extracted from breathing, coughs, and voice signals as
predictors and yields an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.65$-$0.77). We further
explore different unbalanced distributions to show how biases and participant
splits affect performance. Finally, we discuss how the realistic model
presented could be integrated in clinical practice to realize continuous,
ubiquitous, sustainable and affordable testing at population scale.</span>

tasks and holds promise for providing important empirical insight into the
behaviour of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive meta-learning study of data sets and methods for multi-label
classification (MLC). MLC is a practically relevant machine learning task where
each example is labelled with multiple labels simultaneously. Here, we analyze
40 MLC data sets by using 50 meta features describing different properties of
the data. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, the most
prominent meta features that describe the space of MLC data sets are the ones
assessing different aspects of the label space. Second, the meta models show
that the most important meta features describe the label space, and, the meta
features describing the relationships among the labels tend to occur a bit more
often than the meta features describing the distributions between and within
the individual labels. Third, the optimization of the hyperparameters can
improve the predictive performance, however, quite often the extent of the
improvements does not always justify the resource utilization.</span>

collaboratively train a global model, which potentially address the data
privacy issue of machine learning. In such promising paradigm, the performance
will be deteriorated without sufficient training data and other resources in
the learning process. Thus, it is quite crucial to inspire more participants to
contribute their valuable resources with some payments for federated learning.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of incentive schemes for
federate learning. Specifically, we identify the incentive problem in federated
learning and then provide a taxonomy for various schemes. Subsequently, we
summarize the existing incentive mechanisms in terms of the main techniques,
such as Stackelberg game, auction, contract theory, Shapley value,
reinforcement learning, blockchain. By reviewing and comparing some impressive

                                        <span>In the field of adversarial robustness, there is a common practice that
adopts the single-step adversarial training for quickly developing
adversarially robust models. However, the single-step adversarial training is
most likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs
it will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost
the adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic
overfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the
single-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead
of generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage
Optimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains
the model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and
multi-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall
training overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid
catastrophic overfitting. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets demonstrate that under similar amount of training overhead, the
proposed MOAT exhibits better robustness than either single-step or multi-step
adversarial training methods.</span>

large zoo of pretrained models are available. When transferring from a model
zoo, applying classic single-model based transfer learning methods to each
source model suffers from high computational burden and cannot fully utilize
the rich knowledge in the zoo. We propose \emph{Zoo-Tuning} to address these
challenges, which learns to adaptively transfer the parameters of pretrained
models to the target task. With the learnable channel alignment layer and
adaptive aggregation layer, Zoo-Tuning \emph{adaptively aggregates channel
aligned pretrained parameters} to derive the target model, which promotes
knowledge transfer by simultaneously adapting multiple source models to
downstream tasks. The adaptive aggregation substantially reduces the
computation cost at both training and inference. We further propose lite
Zoo-Tuning with the temporal ensemble of batch average gating values to reduce
the storage cost at the inference time. We evaluate our approach on a variety
of tasks, including reinforcement learning, image classification, and facial
landmark detection. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive
transfer learning approach can transfer knowledge from a zoo of models more
effectively and efficiently.</span>

                                        <span>Graph-based multi-view clustering has become an active topic due to the
efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship
between multimedia data. However, existing methods have the following
shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large
scale due to the graph construction and eigen-decomposition. (2) They cannot
well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor
points and tensor Schatten p-norm minimization. Specifically, we construct a
hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.
Extensive experimental results on several datasets indicate that our proposed
method outperforms some state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Click-Through Rate prediction aims to predict the ratio of clicks to
impressions of a specific link. This is a challenging task since (1) there are
usually categorical features, and the inputs will be extremely high-dimensional
if one-hot encoding is applied, (2) not only the original features but also
their interactions are important, (3) an effective prediction may rely on
different features and interactions in different time periods. To overcome
these difficulties, we propose a new interaction detection method, named Online
Random Intersection Chains. The method, which is based on the idea of frequent
itemset mining, detects informative interactions by observing the intersections
of randomly chosen samples. The discovered interactions enjoy high
interpretability as they can be comprehended as logical expressions. ORIC can
be updated every time new data is collected, without being retrained on
historical data. What&#x27;s more, the importance of the historical and latest data
can be controlled by a tuning parameter. A framework is designed to deal with
the streaming interactions, so almost all existing models for CTR prediction
can be applied after interaction detection. Empirical results demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of ORIC on three benchmark datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning aims to learn a global model that performs well on client
devices with limited cross-client communication. Personalized federated
learning (PFL) further extends this setup to handle data heterogeneity between
clients by learning personalized models. A key challenge in this setting is to
learn effectively across clients even though each client has unique data that
is often limited in size. Here we present pFedGP, a solution to PFL that is
based on Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernel learning. GPs are highly
expressive models that work well in the low data regime due to their Bayesian
nature. However, applying GPs to PFL raises multiple challenges. Mainly, GPs
performance depends heavily on access to a good kernel function, and learning a
kernel requires a large training set. Therefore, we propose learning a shared
kernel function across all clients, parameterized by a neural network, with a
personal GP classifier for each client. We further extend pFedGP to include
inducing points using two novel methods, the first helps to improve
generalization in the low data regime and the second reduces the computational
cost. We derive a PAC-Bayes generalization bound on novel clients and
empirically show that it gives non-vacuous guarantees. Extensive experiments on
standard PFL benchmarks with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10, and on a new
setup of learning under input noise show that pFedGP achieves well-calibrated
predictions while significantly outperforming baseline methods, reaching up to
21% in accuracy gain.</span>

                                        <span>The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is being increasingly used in machine
learning applications as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance and offers
significant computational and statistical benefits. Since it is defined as an
expectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte
Carlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the
concentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional
projections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for
SW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is
therefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo
approximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show
that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a
weak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical
findings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a
generative modeling problem.</span>

Abstractions (TIA) that explicitly separates reward-correlated visual features
from distractors. For learning TIA, we introduce the formalism of Task Informed
MDP (TiMDP) that is realized by training two models that learn visual features

upcoming future. Their increasing population is associated with their
increasing needs due to problems like physical disabilities, cognitive issues,
weakened memory and disorganized behavior, that elderly people face with
increasing age. To reduce their financial burden on the world economy and to
enhance their quality of life, it is essential to develop technology-based
solutions that are adaptive, assistive and intelligent in nature. Intelligent
Affect Aware Systems that can not only analyze but also predict the behavior of
elderly people in the context of their day to day interactions with technology
in an IoT-based environment, holds immense potential for serving as a long-term

therefore proposes the framework for an Intelligent Affect Aware environment

forecasting of user experience would provide scope for enhancing the same,

                                        <span>Partial observations of continuous time-series dynamics at arbitrary time
stamps exist in many disciplines. Fitting this type of data using statistical
models with continuous dynamics is not only promising at an intuitive level but
also has practical benefits, including the ability to generate continuous
trajectories and to perform inference on previously unseen time stamps. Despite
exciting progress in this area, the existing models still face challenges in
terms of their representational power and the quality of their variational
approximations. We tackle these challenges with continuous latent process flows
(CLPF), a principled architecture decoding continuous latent processes into
continuous observable processes using a time-dependent normalizing flow driven
by a stochastic differential equation. To optimize our model using maximum
likelihood, we propose a novel piecewise construction of a variational
posterior process and derive the corresponding variational lower bound using
trajectory re-weighting. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of
our contributions in various inference tasks on irregular time grids.
Comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines show our model&#x27;s favourable
performance on both synthetic and real-world time-series data.</span>

Benchmark Large Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC) was proposed at the KDD Cup 2021. The
PCQM4M-LSC dataset defines a molecular HOMO-LUMO property prediction task on
about 3.8M graphs. In this short paper, we show our current work-in-progress
solution which builds an ensemble of three graph neural networks models based
on GIN, Bayesian Neural Networks and DiffPool. Our approach outperforms the
provided baseline by 7.6%. Moreover, using uncertainty in our ensemble&#x27;s
prediction, we can identify molecules whose HOMO-LUMO gaps are harder to
predict (with Pearson&#x27;s correlation of 0.5181). We anticipate that this will
facilitate active learning.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks for image quality enhancement typically need large
quantities of highly-curated training data comprising pairs of low-quality
images and their corresponding high-quality images. While high-quality image
acquisition is typically expensive and time-consuming, medium-quality images
are faster to acquire, at lower equipment costs, and available in larger
quantities. Thus, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that
can leverage training data at multiple levels of quality (e.g., high and medium
quality) to improve performance while limiting costs of data curation. We apply
our mixed-supervision GAN to (i) super-resolve histopathology images and (ii)
enhance laparoscopy images by combining super-resolution and surgical smoke
removal. Results on large clinical and pre-clinical datasets show the benefits
of our mixed-supervision GAN over the state of the art.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performances
for quantum mechanical problems. However, a graph convolution can only cover a
localized region, and cannot capture long-range interactions of atoms. This
behavior is contrary to theoretical interatomic potentials, which is a
fundamental limitation of the spatial based GNNs. In this work, we propose a
novel attention-based framework for molecular property prediction tasks. We
represent a molecular conformation as a discrete atomic sequence combined by
atom-atom distance attributes, named Geometry-aware Transformer (GeoT). In
particular, we adopt a Transformer architecture, which has been widely used for
sequential data. Our proposed model trains sequential representations of
molecular graphs based on globally constructed attentions, maintaining all
spatial arrangements of atom pairs. Our method does not suffer from cost
intensive computations, such as angle calculations. The experimental results on
several public benchmarks and visualization maps verified that keeping the
long-range interatomic attributes can significantly improve the model
predictability.</span>

                                        <span>Despite enormous successful applications of graph neural networks (GNNs)
recently, theoretical understandings of their generalization ability,
especially for node-level tasks where data are not independent and
identically-distributed (IID), have been sparse. The theoretical investigation
of the generalization performance is beneficial for understanding fundamental
issues (such as fairness) of GNN models and designing better learning methods.
In this paper, we present a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for GNNs under a
non-IID semi-supervised learning setup. Moreover, we analyze the generalization
performances on different subgroups of unlabeled nodes, which allows us to
further study an accuracy-(dis)parity-style (un)fairness of GNNs from a
theoretical perspective. Under reasonable assumptions, we demonstrate that the
distance between a test subgroup and the training set can be a key factor
affecting the GNN performance on that subgroup, which calls special attention
to the training node selection for fair learning. Experiments across multiple
GNN models and datasets support our theoretical results.</span>

                                        <span>Localizing and counting large ungulates -- hoofed mammals like cows and elk
-- in very high-resolution satellite imagery is an important task for
supporting ecological studies. Prior work has shown that this is feasible with
deep learning based methods and sub-meter multi-spectral satellite imagery. We
extend this line of work by proposing a baseline method, CowNet, that
simultaneously estimates the number of animals in an image (counts), as well as
predicts their location at a pixel level (localizes). We also propose an
methodology for evaluating such models on counting and localization tasks
across large scenes that takes the uncertainty of noisy labels and the
information needed by stakeholders in ecological monitoring tasks into account.
Finally, we benchmark our baseline method with state of the art vision methods
for counting objects in scenes. We specifically test the temporal
generalization of the resulting models over a large landscape in Point Reyes
Seashore, CA. We find that the LC-FCN model performs the best and achieves an
average precision between 0.56 and 0.61 and an average recall between 0.78 and
0.92 over three held out test scenes.</span>

the presence of latent variables. The main problem of interest is recovering
the causal structure over the latent variables while allowing for general,
potentially nonlinear dependence between the variables. In many practical
problems, the dependence between raw observations (e.g. pixels in an image) is
much less relevant than the dependence between certain high-level, latent
features (e.g. concepts or objects), and this is the setting of interest. We
provide conditions under which both the latent representations and the
underlying latent causal model are identifiable by a reduction to a mixture
oracle. The proof is constructive, and leads to several algorithms for
explicitly reconstructing the full graphical model. We discuss efficient
algorithms and provide experiments illustrating the algorithms in practice.</span>

depends on the proper structure of the modeling pipeline. The proposed approach
is aimed to automate the design of composite machine learning pipelines, which
is equivalent to computation workflows that consist of models and data
operations. The approach combines key ideas of both automated machine learning
and workflow management systems. It designs the pipelines with a customizable
graph-based structure, analyzes the obtained results, and reproduces them. The
evolutionary approach is used for the flexible identification of pipeline
structure. The additional algorithms for sensitivity analysis, atomization, and
hyperparameter tuning are implemented to improve the effectiveness of the
approach. Also, the software implementation on this approach is presented as an
open-source framework. The set of experiments is conducted for the different
datasets and tasks (classification, regression, time series forecasting). The
obtained results confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in the comparison with the state-of-the-art competitors and baseline

on the scale, quality and diversity of the data used for their training.
Collecting and manually annotating large amount of data can be both
time-consuming and costly tasks to perform. In the case of tasks related to
visual human-centric perception, the collection and distribution of such data
may also face restrictions due to legislation regarding privacy. In addition,
the design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ
deep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even
state-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always
perform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between
the virtual and the real world data. As an attempt to tackle and mitigate the
effect of these issues, we present a method that automatically generates
realistic synthetic data with annotations for a) person detection, b) face
recognition, and c) human pose estimation. The proposed method takes as input
real background images and populates them with human figures in various poses.
Instead of using hand-made 3D human models, we propose the use of models
generated through deep learning methods, further reducing the dataset creation
costs, while maintaining a high level of realism. In addition, we provide
open-source and easy to use tools that implement the proposed pipeline,
allowing for generating highly-realistic synthetic datasets for a variety of
tasks. A benchmarking and evaluation in the corresponding tasks shows that
synthetic data can be effectively used as a supplement to real data.</span>

                                        <span>Bayesian optimization is a promising methodology for analog circuit
synthesis. However, the sequential nature of the Bayesian optimization
framework significantly limits its ability to fully utilize real-world
computational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallelizable
Bayesian optimization algorithm via Multi-objective ACquisition function
Ensemble (MACE) to further accelerate the optimization procedure. By sampling
query points from the Pareto front of the probability of improvement (PI),
expected improvement (EI) and lower confidence bound (LCB), we combine the
benefits of state-of-the-art acquisition functions to achieve a delicate
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the unconstrained
optimization problem. Based on this batch design, we further adjust the
algorithm for the constrained optimization problem. By dividing the
optimization procedure into two stages and first focusing on finding an initial
feasible point, we manage to gain more information about the valid region and
can better avoid sampling around the infeasible area. After achieving the first
feasible point, we favor the feasible region by adopting a specially designed
penalization term to the acquisition function ensemble. The experimental
results quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the
overall simulation time by up to 74 times compared to differential evolution
(DE) for the unconstrained optimization problem when the batch size is 15. For
the constrained optimization problem, our proposed algorithm can speed up the
optimization process by up to 15 times compared to the weighted expected
improvement based Bayesian optimization (WEIBO) approach, when the batch size
is 15.</span>

                                        <span>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most popular and
widely-adopted meta-learning algorithms nowadays, which achieves remarkable
success in various learning problems. Yet, with the unique design of nested
inner-loop and outer-loop updates which respectively govern the task-specific
and meta-model-centric learning, the underlying learning objective of MAML
still remains implicit and thus impedes a more straightforward understanding of
it. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to the working mechanism of
MAML and discover that: MAML is analogous to a meta-learner using a supervised
contrastive objective function, where the query features are pulled towards the
support features of the same class and against those of different classes, in
which such contrastiveness is experimentally verified via an analysis based on
the cosine similarity. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the vanilla MAML
algorithm has an undesirable interference term originating from the random
initialization and the cross-task interaction. We therefore propose a simple
but effective technique, zeroing trick, to alleviate such interference, where
the extensive experiments are then conducted on both miniImagenet and Omniglot
datasets to demonstrate the consistent improvement brought by our proposed
technique thus well validating its effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Having access to an exploring restart distribution (the so-called wide
coverage assumption) is critical with policy gradient methods. This is due to
the fact that, while the objective function is insensitive to updates in
unlikely states, the agent may still need improvements in those states in order
to reach a nearly optimal payoff. For this reason, wide coverage is used in
some form when analyzing theoretical properties of practical policy gradient
methods. However, this assumption can be unfeasible in certain environments,
for instance when learning is online, or when restarts are possible only from a
fixed initial state. In these cases, classical policy gradient algorithms can
have very poor convergence properties and sample efficiency. In this paper, we
develop Curious Explorer, a novel and simple iterative state space exploration
strategy that can be used with any starting distribution $\rho$. Curious
Explorer starts from $\rho$, then using intrinsic rewards assigned to the set
of poorly visited states produces a sequence of policies, each one more
exploratory than the previous one in an informed way, and finally outputs a
restart model $\mu$ based on the state visitation distribution of the
exploratory policies. Curious Explorer is provable, in the sense that we
provide theoretical upper bounds on how often an optimal policy visits poorly
visited states. These bounds can be used to prove PAC convergence and sample
efficiency results when a PAC optimizer is plugged in Curious Explorer. This
allows to achieve global convergence and sample efficiency results without any
coverage assumption for REINFORCE, and potentially for any other policy
gradient method ensuring PAC convergence with wide coverage. Finally, we plug
(the output of) Curious Explorer into REINFORCE and TRPO, and show empirically
that it can improve performance in MDPs with challenging exploration.</span>

learning for linearly-solvable Markov decision processes. Our approach assumes
that the state space is partitioned, and the subtasks consist in moving between
the partitions. We represent value functions on several levels of abstraction,
and use the compositionality of subtasks to estimate the optimal values of the
states in each partition. The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal
value estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a
consequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not
suffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions
have equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared. If
the set of boundary states is smaller than the entire state space, our approach
can have significantly smaller sample complexity than that of a flat learner,
and we validate this empirically in several experiments.</span>

                                        <span>3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively
researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network
architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research
work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D
representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to
generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of
dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,
a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which
improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple
model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not
only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also
uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the
prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep
network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.
This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.
Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is
compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains
in performance are demonstrated. Code is available at

                                        <span>Scientific and engineering problems often require the use of artificial
intelligence to aid understanding and the search for promising designs. While
Gaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,
they have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and
multiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of
data-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that
utilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference
to address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built
upon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical
factors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of
mixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the
large training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address
the scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear
combination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel
structure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.
Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large
datasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art
machine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In
addition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the
effect of categorical factors, such as those associated with building blocks of
architectures and element choices in metamaterial and materials design. Our
approach is demonstrated for machine learning of ternary oxide materials and
topology optimization of a multiscale compliant mechanism with aperiodic
microstructures and multiple materials.</span>

                                        <span>Inverse rendering is the problem of decomposing an image into its intrinsic
components, i.e. albedo, normal and lighting. To solve this ill-posed problem
from single image, state-of-the-art methods in shape from shading mostly resort
to supervised training on all the components on either synthetic or real
datasets. Here, we propose a new self-supervised training paradigm that 1)
reduces the need for full supervision on the decomposition task and 2) takes
into account the relighting task. We introduce new self-supervised loss terms
that leverage the consistencies between multi-lit images (images of the same
scene under different illuminations). Our approach is applicable to multi-lit
datasets. We apply our training approach in two settings: 1) train on a mixture
of synthetic and real data, 2) train on real datasets with limited supervision.
We show-case the effectiveness of our training paradigm on both intrinsic
decomposition and relighting and demonstrate how the model struggles in both
tasks without the self-supervised loss terms in limited supervision settings.
We provide results of comprehensive experiments on SfSNet, CelebA and Photoface
datasets and verify the performance of our approach on images in the wild.</span>

                                        <span>Spreadsheet formula prediction has been an important program synthesis
problem with many real-world applications. Previous works typically utilize
input-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis,
where each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet.
However, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world
spreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus
rows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition,
many spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions
of the cell data. However, previous synthesis approaches do not consider
headers as part of the specification. In this work, we present the first
approach for synthesizing spreadsheet formulas from tabular context, which
includes both headers and semi-structured tabular data. In particular, we
propose SpreadsheetCoder, a BERT-based model architecture to represent the
tabular context in both row-based and column-based formats. We train our model
on a large dataset of spreadsheets, and demonstrate that SpreadsheetCoder
achieves top-1 prediction accuracy of 42.51%, which is a considerable
improvement over baselines that do not employ rich tabular context. Compared to
the rule-based system, SpreadsheetCoder assists 82% more users in composing
formulas on Google Sheets.</span>

                                        <span>Gene expression datasets consist of thousand of genes with relatively small
samplesizes (i.e. are large-$p$-small-$n$). Moreover, dependencies of various
orders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical
Model (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high
dimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the
default Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex
interaction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based
Hill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)
leaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its
modifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from
micro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the
analytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which
both directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.

We conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC
algorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously
modelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting
in the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the
complex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific
structure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model
unnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the
network and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved
including many parameters.</span>

class expression learning on RDF knowledge graphs. These approaches often need
to explore a large number of concepts to find adequate hypotheses. This need
arguably stems from current approaches relying on myopic heuristic functions to
guide their search through an infinite concept space. In turn, deep
reinforcement learning provides effective means to address myopia by estimating
how much discounted cumulated future reward states promise. In this work, we
leverage deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning of concepts in
$\mathcal{ALC}$ by proposing DRILL -- a novel class expression learning
approach that uses a convolutional deep Q-learning model to steer its search.
By virtue of its architecture, DRILL is able to compute the expected discounted
cumulated future reward of more than $10^3$ class expressions in a second on
standard hardware. We evaluate DRILL on four benchmark datasets against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our results suggest that DRILL converges to goal
states at least 2.7$\times$ faster than state-of-the-art models on all
benchmark datasets. We provide an open-source implementation of our approach,

healthcare, supply chain and transportation has made them the target of
malicious attacks. Past works in this area focused on centralized Intrusion
Detection System (IDS), assuming the existence of a central entity to perform
data analysis and identify threats. However, such IDS may not always be
feasible, mainly due to spread of data across multiple sources and gathering at
central node can be costly. Also, the earlier works primarily focused on
improving True Positive Rate (TPR) and ignored the False Positive Rate (FPR),
which is also essential to avoid unnecessary downtime of the systems. In this
paper, we first present an architecture for IDS based on hybrid ensemble model,
named PHEC, which gives improved performance compared to state-of-the-art
architectures. We then adapt this model to a federated learning framework that
performs local training and aggregates only the model parameters. Next, we
propose Noise-Tolerant PHEC in centralized and federated settings to address
the label-noise problem. The proposed idea uses classifiers using weighted
convex surrogate loss functions. Natural robustness of KNN classifier towards
noisy data is also used in the proposed architecture. Experimental results on
four benchmark datasets drawn from various security attacks show that our model
achieves high TPR while keeping FPR low on noisy and clean data. Further, they
also demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble models achieve performance in
federated settings close to that of the centralized settings.</span>

image from an abnormal one (e.g., with lesions), is critical in many
perspectives, from lesion detection, data augmentation to clinical surgery
suggestion. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality pseudo-normal
images in the absence of the lesion information. Thus, expensive lesion
segmentation data have been introduced to provide lesion information for the
generative models and improve the quality of the synthetic images. In this
paper, we aim to alleviate the need of a large amount of lesion segmentation
data when generating pseudo-normal images. We propose a Semi-supervised Medical
Image generative LEarning network (SMILE) which not only utilizes limited
medical images with segmentation masks, but also leverages massive medical
images without segmentation masks to generate realistic pseudo-normal images.
Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the best state-of-the-art
model by up to 6% for data augmentation task and 3% in generating high-quality
images. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves comparable
medical image synthesis quality with supervised learning model, using only 50

focuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this
paper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses
building blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together
with skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output.
This combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle
various scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this
experimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three
scenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square
regions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out
that our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios.
Performance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris
StreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and
to some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) models trained on personal data have been shown to leak
information about users. Differential privacy (DP) enables model training with
a guaranteed bound on this leakage. Each new model trained with DP increases
the bound on data leakage and can be seen as consuming part of a global privacy
budget that should not be exceeded. This budget is a scarce resource that must
be carefully managed to maximize the number of successfully trained models.

We describe PrivateKube, an extension to the popular Kubernetes datacenter
orchestrator that adds privacy as a new type of resource to be managed
alongside other traditional compute resources, such as CPU, GPU, and memory.
The abstractions we design for the privacy resource mirror those defined by
Kubernetes for traditional resources, but there are also major differences. For
example, traditional compute resources are replenishable while privacy is not:
a CPU can be regained after a model finishes execution while privacy budget
cannot. This distinction forces a re-design of the scheduler. We present DPF
(Dominant Private Block Fairness) -- a variant of the popular Dominant Resource
Fairness (DRF) algorithm -- that is geared toward the non-replenishable privacy
resource but enjoys similar theoretical properties as DRF.

We evaluate PrivateKube and DPF on microbenchmarks and an ML workload on
Amazon Reviews data. Compared to existing baselines, DPF allows training more

                                        <span>We provide a probabilistic interpretation of attention and show that the
standard dot-product attention in transformers is a special case of Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) inference. The proposed approach suggests the use of
Expectation Maximization algorithms for online adaptation of key and value
model parameters. This approach is useful for cases in which external agents,
e.g., annotators, provide inference-time information about the correct values
of some tokens, e.g, the semantic category of some pixels, and we need for this
new information to propagate to other tokens in a principled manner. We
illustrate the approach on an interactive semantic segmentation task in which
annotators and models collaborate online to improve annotation efficiency.
Using standard benchmarks, we observe that key adaptation boosts model
performance ($\sim10\%$ mIoU) in the low feedback regime and value propagation
improves model responsiveness in the high feedback regime. A PyTorch layer
implementation of our probabilistic attention model will be made publicly
available.</span>

                                        <span>Compressive phase retrieval is a popular variant of the standard compressive
sensing problem, in which the measurements only contain magnitude information.
In this paper, motivated by recent advances in deep generative models, we
provide recovery guarantees with order-optimal sample complexity bounds for
phase retrieval with generative priors. We first show that when using i.i.d.
Gaussian measurements and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with
bounded $k$-dimensional inputs, roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples suffice to
guarantee that the signal is close to any vector that minimizes an
amplitude-based empirical loss function. Attaining this sample complexity with
a practical algorithm remains a difficult challenge, and a popular spectral
initialization method has been observed to pose a major bottleneck. To
partially address this, we further show that roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples
ensure sufficient closeness between the signal and any {\em globally optimal}
solution to an optimization problem designed for spectral initialization
(though finding such a solution may still be challenging). We adapt this result
to sparse phase retrieval, and show that $O(s \log n)$ samples are sufficient
for a similar guarantee when the underlying signal is $s$-sparse and
$n$-dimensional, matching an information-theoretic lower bound. While our
guarantees do not directly correspond to a practical algorithm, we propose a
practical spectral initialization method motivated by our findings, and
experimentally observe significant performance gains over various existing
spectral initialization methods of sparse phase retrieval.</span>

reduction methods, kernel learning by Semidefinite Programming (SDP), Maximum
Variance Unfolding (MVU) or Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), and its variants. We
first explain how the spectral dimensionality reduction methods can be unified
as kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with different kernels. This
unification can be interpreted as eigenfunction learning or representation of
kernel in terms of distance matrix. Then, since the spectral methods are
unified as kernel PCA, we say let us learn the best kernel for unfolding the
manifold of data to its maximum variance. We first briefly introduce kernel
learning by SDP for the transduction task. Then, we explain MVU in detail.
Various versions of supervised MVU using nearest neighbors graph, by class-wise
unfolding, by Fisher criterion, and by colored MVU are explained. We also
explain out-of-sample extension of MVU using eigenfunctions and kernel mapping.
Finally, we introduce other variants of MVU including action respecting
embedding, relaxed MVU, and landmark MVU for big data.</span>

to meet the requirements of customers. One way how this research is conducted
is that a domain expert gathers and categorizes user-generated content into a
complex and fine-grained class structure. In many of such cases, little data
meets complex annotations. It is not yet fully understood how this can be
leveraged successfully for classification. We examine the classification
accuracy of expert labels when used with a) many fine-grained classes and b)
few abstract classes. For scenario b) we compare abstract class labels given by
the domain expert as baseline and by automatic hierarchical clustering. We
compare this to another baseline where the entire class structure is given by a
completely unsupervised clustering approach. By doing so, this work can serve
as an example of how complex expert annotations are potentially beneficial and
can be utilized in the most optimal way for opinion mining in highly specific
domains. By exploring across a range of techniques and experiments, we find
that automated class abstraction approaches in particular the unsupervised
approach performs remarkably well against domain expert baseline on text
classification tasks. This has the potential to inspire opinion mining
applications in order to support market researchers in practice and to inspire
fine-grained automated content analysis on a large scale.</span>

sensor data to perception algorithms to understand the environment. Sensor
fusion, and particularly semantic fusion, with multi-frame tracking is becoming
increasingly popular for detecting 3D objects. Recently, it was shown that
LiDAR-based perception built on deep neural networks is vulnerable to LiDAR
spoofing attacks. Thus, in this work, we perform the first analysis of
camera-LiDAR fusion under spoofing attacks and the first security analysis of
semantic fusion in any AV context. We find first that fusion is more successful
than existing defenses at guarding against naive spoofing. However, we then
define the frustum attack as a new class of attacks on AVs and find that
semantic camera-LiDAR fusion exhibits widespread vulnerability to frustum
attacks with between 70% and 90% success against target models. Importantly,
the attacker needs less than 20 random spoof points on average for successful
attacks - an order of magnitude less than established maximum capability.
Finally, we are the first to analyze the longitudinal impact of perception
attacks by showing the impact of multi-frame attacks.</span>

problem of fundamental importance. Prior work has focused on parametric
approaches that require a known parametric model, which makes estimation
procedures less robust to model mis-specification, non-linearities and
heterogeneities. In this paper, we develop a semi-parametric approach based on
the monotone single-index multi-variate autoregressive model (SIMAM) which
addresses these challenges. We provide theoretical guarantees for dependent
data and an alternating projected gradient descent algorithm. Significantly we
do not explicitly assume mixing conditions on the process (although we do
require conditions analogous to restricted strong convexity) and we achieve
rates of the form $O(T^{-\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt{s\log(TM)})$ (optimal in the
independent design case) where $s$ is the threshold for the maximum in-degree
of the network that indicates the sparsity level, $M$ is the number of actors
and $T$ is the number of time points. In addition, we demonstrate the superior
performance both on simulated data and two real data examples where our SIMAM
approach out-performs state-of-the-art parametric methods both in terms of
prediction and network estimation.</span>

solution vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when there
are many predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving the lasso
in this high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally demanding.
Fortunately, this demand can be alleviated via the use of screening rules that
discard predictors prior to fitting the model, leading to a reduced problem to
be solved. In this paper, we present a new screening strategy: look-ahead
screening. Our method uses safe screening rules to find a range of penalty
values for which a given predictor cannot enter the model, thereby screening
predictors along the remainder of the path. In experiments we show that these
look-ahead screening rules outperform the active warm-start version of the Gap
Safe rules.</span>

networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network
learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs. We show that with a
specific regularization and sufficient over-parameterization, the student

objective function is highly non-convex. The key theoretical tool is the

theorem proving geared towards Finding Longer Proofs (FLoP). Unlike most
learning based approaches, we focus on generalising from very little training
data and achieving near complete confidence. We use several simple, structured
datasets with very long proofs to show that FLoP can successfully generalise a
single training proof to a large class of related problems. On these
benchmarks, FLoP is competitive with strong theorem provers despite using very
limited search, due to its ability to solve problems that are prohibitively
long for other systems.</span>

                                        <span>The generalization gap in reinforcement learning (RL) has been a significant
obstacle that prevents the RL agent from learning general skills and adapting
to varying environments. Increasing the generalization capacity of the RL
systems can significantly improve their performance on real-world working
environments. In this work, we propose a novel policy-aware adversarial data
augmentation method to augment the standard policy learning method with
automatically generated trajectory data. Different from the commonly used
observation transformation based data augmentations, our proposed method
adversarially generates new trajectory data based on the policy gradient
objective and aims to more effectively increase the RL agent&#x27;s generalization
ability with the policy-aware data augmentation. Moreover, we further deploy a
mixup step to integrate the original and generated data to enhance the
generalization capacity while mitigating the over-deviation of the adversarial
data. We conduct experiments on a number of RL tasks to investigate the
generalization performance of the proposed method by comparing it with the
standard baselines and the state-of-the-art mixreg approach. The results show
our method can generalize well with limited training diversity, and achieve the
state-of-the-art generalization test performance.</span>

propose a pruning algorithm, and we show that the proposed algorithm can find a

can improve human and computer use of medical images. A CNN-based classifier
was developed to identify body regions in CT and MRI. 17 CT (18 MRI) body
regions covering the entire human body were defined for the classification
task. Three retrospective databases were built for the AI model training,
validation, and testing, with a balanced distribution of studies per body
region. The test databases originated from a different healthcare network.
Accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier was evaluated for patient age,
patient gender, institution, scanner manufacturer, contrast, slice thickness,
MRI sequence, and CT kernel. The data included a retrospective cohort of 2,934
anonymized CT cases (training: 1,804 studies, validation: 602 studies, test:
528 studies) and 3,185 anonymized MRI cases (training: 1,911 studies,
validation: 636 studies, test: 638 studies). 27 institutions from primary care
hospitals, community hospitals and imaging centers contributed to the test
datasets. The data included cases of all genders in equal proportions and
subjects aged from a few months old to +90 years old. An image-level prediction
accuracy of 91.9% (90.2 - 92.1) for CT, and 94.2% (92.0 - 95.6) for MRI was
achieved. The classification results were robust across all body regions and
confounding factors. Due to limited data, performance results for subjects
under 10 years-old could not be reliably evaluated. We show that deep learning
models can classify CT and MRI images by body region including lower and upper
extremities with high accuracy.</span>

increasingly affecting communities and institutional practices. It is therefore
critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or
universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is
advancing. In this paper, we present a rigorous examination of the values of
the field by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing 100 highly cited ML
papers published at premier ML conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key
features of papers which reveal their values: how they justify their choice of
project, which aspects they uplift, their consideration of potential negative
consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find
that societal needs are typically very loosely connected to the choice of
project, if mentioned at all, and that consideration of negative consequences
is extremely rare. We identify 67 values that are uplifted in machine learning
research, and, of these, we find that papers most frequently justify and assess
themselves based on performance, generalization, efficiency, researcher
understanding, novelty, and building on previous work. We present extensive
textual evidence and analysis of how these values are operationalized. Notably,
we find that each of these top values is currently being defined and applied
with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of
power. Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited
papers and tech companies and elite universities.</span>

of papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,
there are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly
stemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the
current literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the
performance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important
generalization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a
lack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and
little or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling
(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art
AL algorithms in the context of image classification, and we carefully study
these issues as facets of effective evaluation. On the positive side, we show
that AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the
use of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,
there is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art
approach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of
how existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number
of examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL
practitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch
size, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at
every round, and other insights.</span>

                                        <span>We propose and implement a Privacy-preserving Federated Learning ($PPFL$)
framework for mobile systems to limit privacy leakages in federated learning.
Leveraging the widespread presence of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in
high-end and mobile devices, we utilize TEEs on clients for local training, and
on servers for secure aggregation, so that model/gradient updates are hidden
from adversaries. Challenged by the limited memory size of current TEEs, we
leverage greedy layer-wise training to train each model&#x27;s layer inside the
trusted area until its convergence. The performance evaluation of our
implementation shows that $PPFL$ can significantly improve privacy while
incurring small system overheads at the client-side. In particular, $PPFL$ can
successfully defend the trained model against data reconstruction, property
inference, and membership inference attacks. Furthermore, it can achieve
comparable model utility with fewer communication rounds (0.54$\times$) and a
similar amount of network traffic (1.002$\times$) compared to the standard
federated learning of a complete model. This is achieved while only introducing
up to ~15% CPU time, ~18% memory usage, and ~21% energy consumption overhead in
$PPFL$&#x27;s client-side.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a novel algorithm named Expert Q-learning. Expert Q-learning was
inspired by Dueling Q-learning and aimed at incorporating the ideas from
semi-supervised learning into reinforcement learning through splitting Q-values
into state values and action advantages. Different from Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning and Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations, the offline expert
we have used only predicts the value of a state from {-1, 0, 1}, indicating
whether this is a bad, neutral or good state. An expert network was designed in
addition to the Q-network, which updates each time following the regular
offline minibatch update whenever the expert example buffer is not empty. The
Q-network plays the role of the advantage function only during the update. Our
algorithm also keeps asynchronous copies of the Q-network and expert network,
predicting the target values using the same manner as of Double Q-learning.

We compared on the game of Othello our algorithm with the state-of-the-art
Q-learning algorithm, which was a combination of Double Q-learning and Dueling
Q-learning. The results showed that Expert Q-learning was indeed useful and
more resistant to the overestimation bias of Q-learning. The baseline
Q-learning algorithm exhibited unstable and suboptimal behavior, especially
when playing against a stochastic player, whereas Expert Q-learning
demonstrated more robust performance with higher scores. Expert Q-learning
without using examples has also gained better results than the baseline
algorithm when trained and tested against a fixed player. On the other hand,
Expert Q-learning without examples cannot win against the baseline Q-learning
algorithm in direct game competitions despite the fact that it has also shown
the strength of reducing the overestimation bias.</span>

authentication, to add security to their apps. However, the ethical
implications of this type of architecture has not been studied previously. In
this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of running an existing
anti-fraud security challenge, Boxer, in real apps running on mobile devices.
We find that although Boxer does work well overall, it is unable to scan
effectively on devices that run its machine learning models at less than one
frame per second (FPS), blocking users who use inexpensive devices. With the
insights from our study, we design Daredevil, anew anti-fraud system for
scanning payment cards that work swell across the broad range of performance
characteristics and hardware configurations found on modern mobile devices.
Daredevil reduces the number of devices that run at less than one FPS by an
order of magnitude compared to Boxer, providing a more equitable system for
fighting fraud. In total, we collect data from 5,085,444 real devices spread
across 496 real apps running production software and interacting with real

                                        <span>Min-max saddle point games have recently been intensely studied, due to their
wide range of applications, including training Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs). However, most of the recent efforts for solving them are limited to
special regimes such as convex-concave games. Further, it is customarily
assumed that the underlying optimization problem is solved either by a single
machine or in the case of multiple machines connected in centralized fashion,
wherein each one communicates with a central node. The latter approach becomes
challenging, when the underlying communications network has low bandwidth. In
addition, privacy considerations may dictate that certain nodes can communicate
with a subset of other nodes. Hence, it is of interest to develop methods that
solve min-max games in a decentralized manner. To that end, we develop a
decentralized adaptive momentum (ADAM)-type algorithm for solving min-max
optimization problem under the condition that the objective function satisfies
a Minty Variational Inequality condition, which is a generalization to
convex-concave case. The proposed method overcomes shortcomings of recent
non-adaptive gradient-based decentralized algorithms for min-max optimization
problems that do not perform well in practice and require careful tuning. In
this paper, we obtain non-asymptotic rates of convergence of the proposed
algorithm (coined DADAM$^3$) for finding a (stochastic) first-order Nash
equilibrium point and subsequently evaluate its performance on training GANs.
The extensive empirical evaluation shows that DADAM$^3$ outperforms recently
developed methods, including decentralized optimistic stochastic gradient for
solving such min-max problems.</span>

                                        <span>Image-to-image translation plays a vital role in tackling various medical
imaging tasks such as attenuation correction, motion correction, undersampled
reconstruction, and denoising. Generative adversarial networks have been shown
to achieve the state-of-the-art in generating high fidelity images for these
tasks. However, the state-of-the-art GAN-based frameworks do not estimate the
uncertainty in the predictions made by the network that is essential for making
informed medical decisions and subsequent revision by medical experts and has
recently been shown to improve the performance and interpretability of the
model. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-guided progressive learning
scheme for image-to-image translation. By incorporating aleatoric uncertainty
as attention maps for GANs trained in a progressive manner, we generate images
of increasing fidelity progressively. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model
on three challenging medical image translation tasks, including PET to CT
translation, undersampled MRI reconstruction, and MRI motion artefact
correction. Our model generalizes well in three different tasks and improves
performance over state of the art under full-supervision and weak-supervision
with limited data. Code is released here:

                                        <span>Contrastive learning (CL) is effective in learning data representations
without label supervision, where the encoder needs to contrast each positive
sample over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy
loss. However, conventional CL is sensitive to how many negative samples are
included and how they are selected. Proposed in this paper is a doubly CL
strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves
separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and
contrastive repulsion (CACR) makes the query not only exert a greater force to
attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative
samples. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection between CACR and CL from
the perspectives of both positive attraction and negative repulsion and shows
the benefits in both efficiency and robustness brought by separately
contrasting within the sampled positive and negative pairs. Extensive
large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only
consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets in
representation learning, but also provides interpretable contrastive weights,
demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed doubly contrastive strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks have been highly successful in image-based
learning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has
generalized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural
network to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized
convolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra
convolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of
functions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for
traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions
are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian
homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant
function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,
generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra
expansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional
convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads
to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated
VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative
to baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet
performance, we present several real data experiments involving classification
tasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing
on diffusion MRI data. Performance comparisons to the state-of-the-art are also
presented.</span>

to study, track, monitor, and analyze human behavior during activities of daily

can perform the semantic analysis of user interactions on the diverse
contextual parameters during ADLs to identify a list of distinct behavioral
patterns associated with different complex activities. Second, it consists of
an intelligent decision-making algorithm that can analyze these behavioral
patterns and their relationships with the dynamic contextual and spatial

constitute an emergency. These functionalities of this interdisciplinary

                                        <span>An effective approach in meta-learning is to utilize multiple &quot;train tasks&quot;
to learn a good initialization for model parameters that can help solve unseen
&quot;test tasks&quot; with very few samples by fine-tuning from this initialization.
Although successful in practice, theoretical understanding of such methods is
limited. This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the
data from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during
meta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such
meta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue
that the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be
low-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting
variant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency
benefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few
samples to solve unseen test tasks. We present theoretical results that
formalize this idea for linear representation learning on a subspace
meta-learning instance, and experimentally verify this practical benefit of
splitting in simulations and on standard meta-learning benchmarks.</span>

access and expand their utility, since more than 6 million are publicly
available, and they constitute an important corpus to aid research and
education across disciplines. The corpus is growing as new born-digital
documents are included, and since millions of older theses and dissertations
have been converted to digital form to be disseminated electronically in
institutional repositories. In ETDs, as with other scholarly works, figures and
tables can communicate a large amount of information in a concise way. Although
methods have been proposed for extracting figures and tables from born-digital
PDFs, they do not work well with scanned ETDs. Considering this problem, our
assessment of state-of-the-art figure extraction systems is that the reason
they do not function well on scanned PDFs is that they have only been trained
on born-digital documents. To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a
new dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by
humans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.
We use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to
accurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs. We pose and answer
important research questions aimed at finding better methods for figure
extraction from scanned documents. One of those concerns the value for
training, of data augmentation techniques applied to born-digital documents
which are used to train models better suited for figure extraction from scanned
documents. To the best of our knowledge, ScanBank is the first manually
annotated dataset for figure and table extraction for scanned ETDs. A
YOLOv5-based model, trained on ScanBank, outperforms existing comparable
open-source and freely available baseline methods by a considerable margin.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using
its motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,
called social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,
deep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social
interactions on a pedestrian&#x27;s motion. The demonstration that these models can
learn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The
models are compared with and without their social interactions module on two
standard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.
Yet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple
constant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model
social interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we
focus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social
interaction modeling and study whether they use social information at
prediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art
approaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.
First, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random
noise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we
use a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down
their inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their
soft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the
convergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that
the soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored
by the models.</span>

                                        <span>Sound event localization and detection consists of two subtasks which are
sound event detection and direction-of-arrival estimation. While sound event
detection mainly relies on time-frequency patterns to distinguish different
sound classes, direction-of-arrival estimation uses magnitude or phase
differences between microphones to estimate source directions. Therefore, it is
often difficult to jointly train these two subtasks simultaneously. We propose
a novel feature called spatial cue-augmented log-spectrogram (SALSA) with exact
time-frequency mapping between the signal power and the source
direction-of-arrival. The feature includes multichannel log-spectrograms
stacked along with the estimated direct-to-reverberant ratio and a normalized
version of the principal eigenvector of the spatial covariance matrix at each
time-frequency bin on the spectrograms. Experimental results on the DCASE 2021
dataset for sound event localization and detection with directional
interference showed that the deep learning-based models trained on this new
feature outperformed the DCASE challenge baseline by a large margin. We
combined several models with slightly different architectures that were trained
on the new feature to further improve the system performances for the DCASE
sound event localization and detection challenge.</span>

                                        <span>In sparse coding, we attempt to extract features of input vectors, assuming
that the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic
building blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning
features of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven
feature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved
remarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow
to be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.
We propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding
algorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code
within 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the
observation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global
thresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local
receptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural
inclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can
rely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during
training. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined
dictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as
a neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance
of the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in
both synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees
for a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions
the true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.</span>

shootings reported by media, more people in the U.S. think that police use
excessive force during law enforcement, especially to a specific group of
people. We want to apply multidimensional statistical analysis to reveal more
facts than the monotone mainstream media. Our paper has three parts. First, we
proposed a new method to quantify fatal police shooting news reporting
deviation of mainstream media, which includes CNN, FOX, ABC, and NBC. Second,
we analyzed the most comprehensive US fatal police shooting dataset from
Washington Post. We used FP-growth to reveal the frequent patterns and DBSCAN
clustering to find fatal shooting hotspots. We brought multi-attributes (social
economics, demographics, political tendency, education, gun ownership rate,
police training hours, etc.) to reveal connections under the iceberg. We found
that the police shooting rate of a state depends on many variables. The top
four most relevant attributes were state joined year, state land area, gun
ownership rate, and violent crime rate. Third, we proposed four regression
models to predict police shooting rates at the state level. The best model
Kstar could predict the fatal police shooting rate with about 88.53%
correlation coefficient. We also proposed classification models, including
Gradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and
Naive Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.
Our classification models show no significant evidence to conclude that racial
discrimination happened during fatal police shootings recorded by the WP
dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Voter eligibility in United States elections is determined by a patchwork of
state databases containing information about which citizens are eligible to
vote. Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the
exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is
properly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the
database. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,
given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the
US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to
achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when
faced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,
but much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely
on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we
present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden
on analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the
effectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting
VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In
this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are
most effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were
deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization&#x27;s monitoring system and were used
in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,
we propose a newly deployed model which uses historical and demographic
metadata to label the likely root cause of database modifications. We hope to
use this model to predict which modifications have known causes and therefore
better identify potentially anomalous modifications.</span>

architectures applied to the problem of enhancing camera-captured document
images. The results from each network were evaluated both qualitatively and
quantitatively using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics, and also compared
with an existing approach based on traditional computer vision techniques. The
best performing architectures generally produced good enhancement compared to
the existing algorithm, showing that it is possible to use DNNs for document
image enhancement. Furthermore, the best performing architectures could work as
a baseline for future investigations on document enhancement using deep
learning techniques. The main contributions of this paper are: a baseline of
deep learning techniques that can be further improved to provide better
results, and a evaluation methodology using IQA metrics for quantitatively
comparing the produced images from the neural networks to a ground truth.</span>

photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site
measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we
present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their
location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar
radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve
semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a
machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof
pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of
solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches.
Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar
irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a
rooftop.</span>

                                        <span>Visual recognition tasks are often limited to dealing with a small subset of
classes simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We
are interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through
representation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled
classes, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel
classes. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning
approach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the
compositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on
heterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to
estimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled
examples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes
effectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint
optimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as
learning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable performance gains by the proposed
approach in multiple image retrieval and novel class discovery benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work on graph generative models has made remarkable progress towards
generating increasingly realistic graphs, as measured by global graph features
such as degree distribution, density, and clustering coefficients. Deep
generative models have also made significant advances through better modelling
of the local correlations in the graph topology, which have been very useful
for predicting unobserved graph components, such as the existence of a link or
the class of a node, from nearby observed graph components. A complete
scientific understanding of graph data should address both global and local
structure. In this paper, we propose a joint model for both as complementary
objectives in a graph VAE framework. Global structure is captured by
incorporating graph kernels in a probabilistic model whose loss function is
closely related to the maximum mean discrepancy(MMD) between the global
structures of the reconstructed and the input graphs. The ELBO objective
derived from the model regularizes a standard local link reconstruction term
with an MMD term. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the
realism of the generated graph structures, typically by 1-2 orders of magnitude
of graph structure metrics, compared to leading graph VAEand GAN models. Local
link reconstruction improves as well in many cases.</span>

                                        <span>The last-generation video conferencing software allows users to utilize a
virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy
concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other
hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual
background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to
understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays
an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different
kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set
of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint.
In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether
a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the
first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search
for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm
that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector
against different kinds of attacks. This work&#x27;s performance is especially
noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance
especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing,
like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG
compression with different quality factors.</span>

solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can
modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for
choosing others. However, there is currently no formalism nor theory for how to
achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we
define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic
mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce
what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm
satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework
as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for
decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal
difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient
methods do not. Empirical evidence suggests that such action-value methods are
more sample efficient than policy-gradient methods on transfer problems that
require only sparse changes to a sequence of previously optimal decisions.</span>

population dynamics is essential in conservation efforts; however, tracking
elephants is a difficult task, usually relying on the invasive and sometimes
dangerous placement of GPS collars. Although there have been many recent
successes in the use of computer vision techniques for automated identification
of other species, identification of elephants is extremely difficult and

population. We have built and deployed a web-based platform and database for
human-in-the-loop re-identification of elephants combining manual attribute
labeling and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, known as

                                        <span>Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on the two smallest
normed division algebras, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Recent results suggest
that trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective
means to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on
real-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link
prediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution
operations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches
QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and
OMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous
state-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx. ConvQ and ConvO
build upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in a way
inspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on
seven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10.
Experimental results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued
vector representations become more apparent as the size and complexity of the
knowledge graph grows. ConvO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
FB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO
outperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in all metrics. Results also
suggest that link prediction performances can be further improved via
prediction averaging. To foster reproducible research, we provide an
open-source implementation of approaches, including training and evaluation
scripts as well as pretrained models.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to memorization
or overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of
robust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A
prominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by
curriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the &#x60;small loss trick&#x27;
wherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are
selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and
it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also
require information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable
in practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample
selection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch
to provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any
additional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information
on noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.</span>

proposed by \citet{garber2020online}, where the loss functions may be chosen by
an adversary, but are then presented to the online algorithm in a uniformly
random order. Focusing on the scenario where the cumulative loss function is

non-convex, we give algorithms that achieve the optimal bounds and
significantly outperform the results of \citet{garber2020online}, completely
removing the dimension dependence and improving their scaling with respect to
the strong convexity parameter. Our analysis relies on novel connections

factorization (NMF) with the $\beta$-divergence objective function. Our new
updates are derived from a joint majorization-minimization (MM) scheme, in
which an auxiliary function (a tight upper bound of the objective function) is
built for the two factors jointly and minimized at each iteration. This is in
contrast with the classic approach in which the factors are optimized
alternately and a MM scheme is applied to each factor individually. Like the
classic approach, our joint MM algorithm also results in multiplicative updates
that are simple to implement. They however yield a significant drop of
computation time (for equally good solutions), in particular for some
$\beta$-divergences of important applicative interest, such as the squared
Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler or Itakura-Saito divergences. We
report experimental results using diverse datasets: face images, audio
spectrograms, hyperspectral data and song play counts. Depending on the value
of $\beta$ and on the dataset, our joint MM approach yields a CPU time
reduction of about $10\%$ to $78\%$ in comparison to the classic alternating
scheme.</span>

presents significant opportunities for improving the resulting embeddings, and
consequently for increased performance in downstream applications. Yet, little
research effort has focussed on this area and much of the carried out research
reports only marginally improved results compared to models trained without
temporal scopes (static models). Furthermore, rather than leveraging existing
work on static models, they introduce new models specific to temporal knowledge
graphs. We propose a novel perspective that takes advantage of the power of
existing static embedding models by focussing effort on manipulating the data
instead. Our method, SpliMe, draws inspiration from the field of signal
processing and early work in graph embedding. We show that SpliMe competes with
or outperforms the current state of the art in temporal KGE. Additionally, we
uncover issues with the procedure currently used to assess the performance of
static models on temporal graphs and introduce two ways to counteract them.</span>

strides in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks, such as object
and speech recognition. Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity
devices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple
performance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high
accuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the
various embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to
witness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
across consumer devices. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this
potentially game-changing question by presenting an array of design techniques
for efficient AI systems. We start by examining the major roadblocks when
targeting both programmable processors and custom accelerators. Then, we
present diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a
cross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,
and their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems
that do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can
improve inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and
FPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI

not easy, and thus a lot of researches have been done to handle data with noisy
labels. Most recent state-of-art solutions for noisy label problems are built
on the small-loss strategy which exploits the memorization effect. While it is
a powerful tool, the memorization effect has several drawbacks. The
performances are sensitive to the choice of a training epoch required for
utilizing the memorization effect. In addition, when the labels are heavily
contaminated or imbalanced, the memorization effect may not occur in which case
the methods based on the small-loss strategy fail to identify clean labeled
data. We introduce a new method called INN(Integration with the Nearest
Neighborhoods) to refine clean labeled data from training data with noisy
labels. The proposed method is based on a new discovery that a prediction
pattern at neighbor regions of clean labeled data is consistently different
from that of noisy labeled data regardless of training epochs. The INN method
requires more computation but is much stable and powerful than the small-loss
strategy. By carrying out various experiments, we demonstrate that the INN
method resolves the shortcomings in the memorization effect successfully and
thus is helpful to construct more accurate deep prediction models with training
data with noisy labels.</span>

adversarial behavior, where all the participating agents are prone to failure.
We model each agent&#x27;s state over time as a two-state Markov chain that
indicates Byzantine or trustworthy behaviors at different time instants. We set
no restrictions on the maximum number of Byzantine agents at any given time. We
design our method based on three layers of defense: 1) Temporal gradient
averaging, 2) robust aggregation, and 3) gradient normalization. We study two

important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the
experimental determination of miRNA sequence and structure is both expensive
and time-consuming. Therefore, computational and machine learning-based
approaches have been adopted to predict novel microRNAs. With the involvement
of data science and machine learning in biology, multiple research studies have
been conducted to find microRNAs with different computational methods and
different miRNA features. Multiple approaches are discussed in detail
considering the learning algorithm/s used, features considered, dataset/s used
and the criteria used in evaluations. This systematic review focuses on the
machine learning methods developed for miRNA identification in plants. This
will help researchers to gain a detailed idea about past studies and identify
novel paths that solve drawbacks occurred in past studies. Our findings
highlight the need for plant-specific computational methods for miRNA
identification.</span>

                                        <span>Attention Mechanism is a widely used method for improving the performance of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computer vision tasks. Despite its
pervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems
from. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual
attention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data
rather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is
only a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their
importance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication
in attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map
multiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order
non-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a
regularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable
landscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and
stability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,
and make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed
effectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map
multiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in
ResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various
datasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role
in improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism
in existing methods.</span>

studies how to colourise greyscale images (for restoration). Deep learning
techniques improved image colourisation yielding astonishing results. These
differ by various factors, such as structural differences, input types, user
assistance, etc. Most of them, base the architectural structure on
convolutional layers with no emphasis on layers specialised in object features
extraction. We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named
TUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers
and capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every
single image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by
skip and residual connections. We pose the problem as a per pixel colour
classification task that identifies colours as a bin in a quantized space. To
train the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we
propose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by
only manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this
scheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images
and progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training
phase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach
with ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality
metrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation. We
performed a user study to quantify the perceptual realism of the colourisation
results demonstrating: that progressive learning let the TUCaN achieve better
colours than the end to end scheme; and pointing out the limitations of the
existing evaluation metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled
source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous methods focus on learning
domain-invariant features to decrease the discrepancy between the feature
distributions as well as minimizing the source error and have made remarkable
progress. However, a recently proposed theory reveals that such a strategy is
not sufficient for a successful domain adaptation. It shows that besides a
small source error, both the discrepancy between the feature distributions and
the discrepancy between the labeling functions should be small across domains.
The discrepancy between the labeling functions is essentially the cross-domain
errors which are ignored by existing methods. To overcome this issue, in this
paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate all the objectives into a
unified optimization framework. Moreover, the incorrect pseudo labels widely
used in previous methods can lead to error accumulation during learning. To
alleviate this problem, the pseudo labels are obtained by utilizing structural
information of the target domain besides source classifier and we propose a
curriculum learning based strategy to select the target samples with more
accurate pseudo-labels during training. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted, and the results validate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve
traditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited
amount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from
airborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.
Therefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate
response variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This
increases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression
function between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix
convolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based
AGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions
retrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the
same area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture
characteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided
generative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.
Further research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale
and low-cost predictions of AGB.</span>

fundamental demand for next generation indoor and outdoor location-based
services. To bring about such ambition, a suite of collaborative sensing
modalities is required in order to sustain performance irrespective of
challenging dynamic conditions. Of the many modalities on offer, inertial
tracking plays a key role under momentary unfavourable operational conditions
owing to its independence of the surrounding environment. However, inertial
tracking has traditionally (i) suffered from excessive error growth and (ii)
required extensive and cumbersome tuning. Both of these issues have limited the
appeal and utility of inertial tracking. In this paper, we present DIT: a novel
Deep learning Inertial Tracking system that overcomes prior limitations;
namely, by (i) significantly reducing tracking drift and (ii) seamlessly
constructing robust and generalisable learned models. DIT describes two core
contributions: (i) DIT employs a robotic platform augmented with a mechanical
slider subsystem that automatically samples inertial signal variabilities
arising from different sensor mounting geometries. We use the platform to
curate in-house a 7.2 million sample dataset covering an aggregate distance of
21 kilometres split into 11 indexed sensor mounting geometries. (ii) DIT uses
deep learning, optimal transport, and domain adaptation (DA) to create a model
which is robust to variabilities in sensor mounting geometry. The overall
system synthesises high-performance and generalisable inertial navigation
models in an end-to-end, robotic-learning fashion. In our evaluation, DIT
outperforms an industrial-grade sensor fusion baseline by 10x (90th percentile)
and a state-of-the-art adversarial DA technique by &gt; 2.5x in performance (90th
percentile) and &gt;10x in training time.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks often exhibit poor performance on data that is unlikely
under the train-time data distribution, for instance data affected by
corruptions. Previous works demonstrate that test-time adaptation to data
shift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves
performance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully
test-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target
distribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks.
Specifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by
addressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.
This is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and
adding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that
prevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to
prepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo
test-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned
solely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion
without any target domain labels or source domain data. We show that our
approach outperforms previous work in improving the robustness of publicly
available pretrained image classifiers to common corruptions on such
challenging benchmarks as ImageNet-C.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising framework that has great potentials in
privacy preservation and in lowering the computation load at the cloud. FedAvg
and FedProx are two widely adopted algorithms. However, recent work raised
concerns on these two methods: (1) their fixed points do not correspond to the
stationary points of the original optimization problem, and (2) the common
model found might not generalize well locally.

In this paper, we alleviate these concerns. Towards this, we adopt the
statistical learning perspective yet allow the distributions to be
heterogeneous and the local data to be unbalanced. We show, in the general
kernel regression setting, that both FedAvg and FedProx converge to the
minimax-optimal error rates. Moreover, when the kernel function has a finite
rank, the convergence is exponentially fast. Our results further analytically
quantify the impact of the model heterogeneity and characterize the federation
gain - the reduction of the estimation error for a worker to join the federated
learning compared to the best local estimator. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to show the achievability of minimax error rates under FedAvg and
FedProx, and the first to characterize the gains in joining FL. Numerical
experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings on the statistical
optimality of FedAvg and FedProx and the federation gains.</span>

enabled the generation of reasonably good speech quality with a single model
and made it possible to synthesize the speech of a speaker with limited
training data. Fine-tuning to the target speaker data with the multi-speaker
model can achieve better quality, however, there still exists a gap compared to
the real speech sample and the model depends on the speaker. In this work, we
propose GANSpeech, which is a high-fidelity multi-speaker TTS model that adopts
the adversarial training method to a non-autoregressive multi-speaker TTS
model. In addition, we propose simple but efficient automatic scaling methods
for feature matching loss used in adversarial training. In the subjective
listening tests, GANSpeech significantly outperformed the baseline
multi-speaker FastSpeech and FastSpeech2 models, and showed a better MOS score
than the speaker-specific fine-tuned FastSpeech2.</span>

applications, such as smart homes and assisted living. In this paper, we target
a new healthcare application of human activity recognition, early mobility
recognition for Intensive Care Unit(ICU) patients. Early mobility is essential
for ICU patients who suffer from long-time immobilization. Our system includes
accelerometer-based data collection from ICU patients and an AI model to
recognize patients&#x27; early mobility. To improve the model accuracy and
stability, we identify features that are insensitive to sensor orientations and
propose a segment voting process that leverages a majority voting strategy to
recognize each segment&#x27;s activity. Our results show that our system improves
model accuracy from 77.78\% to 81.86\% and reduces the model instability
(standard deviation) from 16.69\% to 6.92\%, compared to the same AI model
without our feature engineering and segment voting process.</span>

severe consequences of falling. This is why rapid assistance is a critical
task. Ambient assisted living (AAL) uses recent technologies such as 5G
networks and the internet of medical things (IoMT) to address this research
area. Edge computing can reduce the cost of cloud communication, including high
latency and bandwidth use, by moving conventional healthcare services and
applications closer to end-users. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such
as deep learning (DL) have been used recently for automatic fall detection, as
well as supporting healthcare services. However, DL requires a vast amount of
data and substantial processing power to improve its performance for the IoMT
linked to the traditional edge computing environment. This research proposes an
effective fall detection framework based on DL algorithms and mobile edge
computing (MEC) within 5G wireless networks, the aim being to empower
IoMT-based healthcare applications. We also propose the use of a deep gated
recurrent unit (DGRU) neural network to improve the accuracy of existing
DL-based fall detection methods. DGRU has the advantage of dealing with
time-series IoMT data, and it can reduce the number of parameters and avoid the
vanishing gradient problem. The experimental results on two public datasets
show that the DGRU model of the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy
rates compared to the current related works on the same datasets.</span>

their limitation defined by Federal Communications Commission (FCC). To this
end, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is considered as a promising technology to
handle this spectrum scarcity. However, standard DSA techniques often rely on
analytical modeling wireless networks, making its application intractable in
under-measured network environments. Therefore, utilizing neural networks to

we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) based framework for the task of DSA,
where FL is a distributive machine learning framework that can reserve the
privacy of network terminals under heterogeneous data distributions. We discuss
the opportunities, challenges, and opening problems of this framework. To
evaluate its feasibility, we implement a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

computer vision. Significant progress has recently been made in developing
neural scene representations and rendering techniques that synthesize
photorealistic images from arbitrary views. These representations, however, are
extremely slow to train and often also slow to render. Inspired by neural
variants of image-based rendering, we develop a new neural rendering approach
with the goal of quickly learning a high-quality representation which can also
be rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a
unique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image
feature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation
convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural
shape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape
and image features can then be extracted using traditional graphics techniques
and rendered in real time. We show that MetaNLR++ achieves similar or better
novel view synthesis results in a fraction of the time that competing methods
require.</span>

                                        <span>Recently there has been significant theoretical progress on understanding the
convergence and generalization of gradient-based methods on nonconvex losses
with overparameterized models. Nevertheless, many aspects of optimization and
generalization and in particular the critical role of small random
initialization are not fully understood. In this paper, we take a step towards
demystifying this role by proving that small random initialization followed by
a few iterations of gradient descent behaves akin to popular spectral methods.
We also show that this implicit spectral bias from small random initialization,
which is provably more prominent for overparameterized models, also puts the
gradient descent iterations on a particular trajectory towards solutions that
are not only globally optimal but also generalize well. Concretely, we focus on
the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few measurements via a
natural nonconvex formulation. In this setting, we show that the trajectory of
the gradient descent iterations from small random initialization can be
approximately decomposed into three phases: (I) a spectral or alignment phase
where we show that that the iterates have an implicit spectral bias akin to
spectral initialization allowing us to show that at the end of this phase the
column space of the iterates and the underlying low-rank matrix are
sufficiently aligned, (II) a saddle avoidance/refinement phase where we show
that the trajectory of the gradient iterates moves away from certain degenerate
saddle points, and (III) a local refinement phase where we show that after
avoiding the saddles the iterates converge quickly to the underlying low-rank
matrix. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of
overparameterized nonconvex optimization schemes that may have implications for
computational problems beyond low-rank reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity
authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and
stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these
models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models
using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has
limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing
transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.
However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and
degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting
to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial
patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by
generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like
features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we
show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target
models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive
digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the
physical world as well.</span>

                                        <span>Quantifying entropy production (EP) is essential to understand stochastic
systems at mesoscopic scales, such as living organisms or biological
assemblies. However, without tracking the relevant variables, it is challenging
to figure out where and to what extent EP occurs from recorded time-series
image data from experiments. Here, applying a convolutional neural network
(CNN), a powerful tool for image processing, we develop an estimation method
for EP through an unsupervised learning algorithm that calculates only from
movies. Together with an attention map of the CNN&#x27;s last layer, our method can
not only quantify stochastic EP but also produce the spatiotemporal pattern of
the EP (dissipation map). We show that our method accurately measures the EP
and creates a dissipation map in two nonequilibrium systems, the bead-spring
model and a network of elastic filaments. We further confirm high performance
even with noisy, low spatial resolution data, and partially observed
situations. Our method will provide a practical way to obtain dissipation maps
and ultimately contribute to uncovering the nonequilibrium nature of complex
systems.</span>

processes more comprehensively than homogeneous systems. Access to multiple
modalities of sensory data allow such systems to fuse information between
complementary sources and learn richer representations of a phenomenon of
interest. Often, these data are correlated but vary in fidelity, i.e., accuracy
(bias) and precision (noise). Low-fidelity data may be more plentiful, while
high-fidelity data may be more trustworthy. In this paper, we address the
problem of multi-robot online estimation and coverage control by combining low-
and high-fidelity data to learn and cover a sensory function of interest. We
propose two algorithms for this task of heterogeneous learning and coverage --
namely Stochastic Sequencing of Multi-fidelity Learning and Coverage (SMLC) and
Deterministic Sequencing of Multi-fidelity Learning and Coverage (DMLC) -- and
prove that they converge asymptotically. In addition, we demonstrate the
empirical efficacy of SMLC and DMLC through numerical simulations.</span>

today&#x27;s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators --
tuned for low prediction latency -- preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii)~a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components
if they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and
real-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the
nominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these
findings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful
choice of each nominator&#x27;s training set is sometimes the only difference
between a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good
choice manually is difficult, we learn one instead. In particular, using a
Mixture-of-Experts approach, we train the nominators (experts) to specialize on
different subsets of the item pool. This significantly improves performance.</span>

to the variation norm. Upper bounds on these rates have been established for
sigmoidal and ReLU activation functions, but it has remained an important open
problem whether these rates are sharp. In this article, we provide a solution
to this problem by proving sharp lower bounds on the approximation rates for
shallow neural networks, which are obtained by lower bounding the $L^2$-metric
entropy of the convex hull of the neural network basis functions. In addition,
our methods also give sharp lower bounds on the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of this
convex hull, which show that the variation spaces corresponding to shallow
neural networks cannot be efficiently approximated by linear methods. These
lower bounds apply to both sigmoidal activation functions with bounded
variation and to activation functions which are a power of the ReLU. Our
results also quantify how much stronger the Barron spectral norm is than the
variation norm and, combined with previous results, give the asymptotics of the
$L^\infty$-metric entropy up to logarithmic factors in the case of the ReLU
activation function.</span>

data have been heavily studied recently. However, the generalization ability of
deep models on complex real-world HAR data is limited by the availability of
high-quality labeled activity data, which are hard to obtain. In this paper, we
design a similarity embedding neural network that maps input sensor signals
onto real vectors through carefully designed convolutional and LSTM layers. The
embedding network is trained with a pairwise similarity loss, encouraging the
clustering of samples from the same class in the embedded real space, and can
be effectively trained on a small dataset and even on a noisy dataset with
mislabeled samples. Based on the learned embeddings, we further propose both
nonparametric and parametric approaches for activity recognition. Extensive
evaluation based on two public datasets has shown that the proposed similarity
embedding network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep models on HAR
classification tasks, is robust to mislabeled samples in the training set, and
can also be used to effectively denoise a noisy dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Light binary convolutional neural networks (LB-CNN) are particularly useful
when implemented in low-energy computing platforms as required in many
industrial applications. Herein, a framework for optimizing compact LB-CNN is
introduced and its effectiveness is evaluated. The framework is freely
available and may run on free-access cloud platforms, thus requiring no major
investments. The optimized model is saved in the standardized .h5 format and
can be used as input to specialized tools for further deployment into specific
technologies, thus enabling the rapid development of various intelligent image
sensors. The main ingredient in accelerating the optimization of our model,
particularly the selection of binary convolution kernels, is the Chainer/Cupy
machine learning library offering significant speed-ups for training the output
layer as an extreme-learning machine. Additional training of the output layer
using Keras/Tensorflow is included, as it allows an increase in accuracy.
Results for widely used datasets including MNIST, GTSRB, ORL, VGG show very
good compromise between accuracy and complexity. Particularly, for face
recognition problems a carefully optimized LB-CNN model provides up to 100%
accuracies. Such TinyML solutions are well suited for industrial applications
requiring image recognition with low energy consumption.</span>

                                        <span>In the past decades, many graph drawing techniques have been proposed for
generating aesthetically pleasing graph layouts. However, it remains a
challenging task since different layout methods tend to highlight different
characteristics of the graphs. Recently, studies on deep learning based graph
drawing algorithm have emerged but they are often not generalizable to
arbitrary graphs without re-training. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional
Graph Neural Network based deep learning framework, DeepGD, which can draw
arbitrary graphs once trained. It attempts to generate layouts by compromising
among multiple pre-specified aesthetics considering a good graph layout usually
complies with multiple aesthetics simultaneously. In order to balance the
trade-off, we propose two adaptive training strategies which adjust the weight
factor of each aesthetic dynamically during training. The quantitative and
qualitative assessment of DeepGD demonstrates that it is capable of drawing
arbitrary graphs effectively, while being flexible at accommodating different
aesthetic criteria.</span>

fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation challenge, without
any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A
cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that
generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion
model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution
diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution
details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies
crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data
augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the
super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation
prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to
train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at
128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep.</span>

                                        <span>Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding
environment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception
methods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and
pictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.
However, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its
infancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent
years. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception
mechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this
fact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and
depth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed
new network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only
used a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and
a semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the
output of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison
between the developed network and original network showed that our novel
structures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\% of relative
error of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were
carried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to
isolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and
semantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular
synthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an
appropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these
cases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against
domain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.</span>

have promised to increase data throughput by allowing concurrent communication
between one Access Point and multiple users. However, we are still a long way
from enjoying such MU-MIMO MAC protocol improvements for bandwidth hungry
applications such as video streaming in practical WiFi network settings due to
heterogeneous channel conditions and devices, unreliable transmissions, and
lack of useful feedback exchange among the lower and upper layers&#x27;
requirements. This paper introduces MuViS, a novel dual-phase optimization
framework that proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware MU-MIMO
optimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. MuViS first
employs reinforcement learning to optimize the MU-MIMO user group and mode
selection for users based on their PHY/MAC layer characteristics. The video
bitrate is then optimized based on the user&#x27;s mode (Multi-User (MU) or
Single-User (SU)). We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and
laptops using 802.11ac WiFi. Our experimental results in various indoor
environments and configurations show a scalable framework that can support a
large number of users with streaming at high video rates and satisfying QoE
requirements.</span>

successful in the vision and natural language domains, enabling
state-of-the-art performance with orders of magnitude less labeled data.
However, such methods are domain-specific and little has been done to leverage
this technique on real-world tabular datasets. We propose SCARF, a simple,
widely-applicable technique for contrastive learning, where views are formed by
corrupting a random subset of features. When applied to pre-train deep neural
networks on the 69 real-world, tabular classification datasets from the
OpenML-CC18 benchmark, SCARF not only improves classification accuracy in the
fully-supervised setting but does so also in the presence of label noise and in
the semi-supervised setting where only a fraction of the available training
data is labeled. We show that SCARF complements existing strategies and

a subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the
task are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., they should
effectively &quot;unlearn&quot; deleted data, but in a way that does not require
excessive computation effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of
deletions. Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount
of approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the
spirit of &quot;the right to be forgotten&quot; have given rise to requirements for
certifiability, i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has
indeed been unlearned by the ML model.

In this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art
approximate unlearning methods for linear models and demonstrate the trade-offs
between efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In
implementing the study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a
common ML pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six
real-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the
effect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and
the performance of each unlearning method in different settings. We also
propose a practical online strategy to determine when the accumulated error
from approximate unlearning is large enough to warrant a full retrain of the ML
model.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we introduce adversarially robust streaming algorithms for
central machine learning and algorithmic tasks, such as regression and
clustering, as well as their more general counterparts, subspace embedding,
low-rank approximation, and coreset construction. For regression and other
numerical linear algebra related tasks, we consider the row arrival streaming
model. Our results are based on a simple, but powerful, observation that many
importance sampling-based algorithms give rise to adversarial robustness which
is in contrast to sketching based algorithms, which are very prevalent in the
streaming literature but suffer from adversarial attacks. In addition, we show
that the well-known merge and reduce paradigm in streaming is adversarially
robust. Since the merge and reduce paradigm allows coreset constructions in the
streaming setting, we thus obtain robust algorithms for $k$-means, $k$-median,
$k$-center, Bregman clustering, projective clustering, principal component
analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems
yet require no new algorithmic implementations. Finally, we empirically confirm
the robustness of our algorithms on various adversarial attacks and demonstrate
that by contrast, some common existing algorithms are not robust.

                                        <span>Molecular graph generation is a fundamental but challenging task in various
applications such as drug discovery and material science, which requires
generating valid molecules with desired properties. Auto-regressive models,
which usually construct graphs following sequential actions of adding nodes and
edges at the atom-level, have made rapid progress in recent years. However,
these atom-level models ignore high-frequency subgraphs that not only capture
the regularities of atomic combination in molecules but also are often related
to desired chemical properties. In this paper, we propose a method to
automatically discover such common substructures, which we call {\em graph
pieces}, from given molecular graphs. Based on graph pieces, we leverage a
variational autoencoder to generate molecules in two phases: piece-level graph
generation followed by bond completion. Experiments show that our graph piece
variational autoencoder achieves better performance over state-of-the-art
baselines on property optimization and constrained property optimization tasks
with higher computational efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have emerged as very successful tools for image
restoration and reconstruction tasks. These networks are often trained
end-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted
measurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on
large and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often
difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images.
Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems,
in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI
reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training
data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically
designed to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as
naive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through
extensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data
regime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the
art while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data
regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA can
improve the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test
distribution.</span>

                                        <span>Balancing exploration and exploitation (EE) is a fundamental problem in
contex-tual bandit. One powerful principle for EE trade-off isOptimism in Face
of Uncer-tainty(OFU), in which the agent takes the action according to an upper
confidencebound (UCB) of reward. OFU has achieved (near-)optimal regret bound
for lin-ear/kernel contextual bandits. However, it is in general unknown how to
deriveefficient and effective EE trade-off methods for non-linearcomplex tasks,
suchas contextual bandit with deep neural network as the reward function. In
thispaper, we propose a novel OFU algorithm namedregularized OFU(ROFU). InROFU,
we measure the uncertainty of the reward by a differentiable function
andcompute the upper confidence bound by solving a regularized optimization
prob-lem. We prove that, for multi-armed bandit, kernel contextual bandit and
neuraltangent kernel bandit, ROFU achieves (near-)optimal regret bounds with
certainuncertainty measure, which theoretically justifies its effectiveness on
EE trade-off.Importantly, ROFU admits a very efficient implementation with
gradient-basedoptimizer, which easily extends to general deep neural network
models beyondneural tangent kernel, in sharp contrast with previous OFU
methods. The em-pirical evaluation demonstrates that ROFU works extremelywell
for contextualbandits under various settings.</span>

minimized when the factorized matrices are adapted to each matrix by a maximum
a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We use a gradient descent method for the MAP
estimation, which enables us to backpropagate the expected imputation error
through the gradient descent steps for updating neural network parameters since
each gradient descent step is written in a closed form and is differentiable.
The proposed method can meta-learn from matrices even when their rows and

                                        <span>Learning from multiple annotators aims to induce a high-quality classifier
from training instances, where each of them is associated with a set of
possibly noisy labels provided by multiple annotators under the influence of
their varying abilities and own biases. In modeling the probability transition
process from latent true labels to observed labels, most existing methods adopt
class-level confusion matrices of annotators that observed labels do not depend
on the instance features, just determined by the true labels. It may limit the
performance that the classifier can achieve. In this work, we propose the noise
transition matrix, which incorporates the influence of instance features on
annotators&#x27; performance based on confusion matrices. Furthermore, we propose a
simple yet effective learning framework, which consists of a classifier module
and a noise transition matrix module in a unified neural network architecture.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison

of novel waveforms that can support these emerging applications becomes

approach to design waveforms through joint learning of pulse shaping and

Optimization is performed to maximize an achievable information rate, while
satisfying constraints on out-of-band emission and power envelope. Our results
show that the proposed approach enables up to orders of magnitude smaller
adjacent channel leakage ratios (ACLRs) with peak-to-average power ratios

key elements of network traffic data that allow intrusion detection. In
addition, we propose a new feature selection method that addresses the
challenge of considering continuous input features and discrete target values.
We show that the proposed method performs well against the benchmark selection
methods. We use our findings to develop a highly effective machine
learning-based detection systems that achieves 99.9% accuracy in distinguishing
between DDoS and benign signals. We believe that our results can be useful to

                                        <span>Text to speech (TTS), or speech synthesis, which aims to synthesize
intelligible and natural speech given text, is a hot research topic in speech,
language, and machine learning communities and has broad applications in the
industry. As the development of deep learning and artificial intelligence,
neural network-based TTS has significantly improved the quality of synthesized
speech in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on
neural TTS, aiming to provide a good understanding of current research and
future trends. We focus on the key components in neural TTS, including text
analysis, acoustic models and vocoders, and several advanced topics, including
fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc.
We further summarize resources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource
implementations) and discuss future research directions. This survey can serve
both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on TTS.</span>

Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Our end-to-end approach learns progressively refined
generative embedding spaces constrained within and across the involved
modalities (visual, language). The inter-modal constraints are defined between
action sequence embedding and embeddings of Parts of Speech (PoS) tagged words
in the corresponding action description. We deploy SynSE for the task of
skeleton-based action sequence recognition. Our design choices enable SynSE to
generalize compositionally, i.e., recognize sequences whose action descriptions
contain words not encountered during training. We also extend our approach to
the more challenging Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem via a
confidence-based gating mechanism. We are the first to present zero-shot
skeleton action recognition results on the large-scale NTU-60 and NTU-120
skeleton action datasets with multiple splits. Our results demonstrate SynSE&#x27;s
state of the art performance in both ZSL and GZSL settings compared to strong
baselines on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. The code and pretrained models

requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods
suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this
problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for
face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to
conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose
coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other
features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles
that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline,
through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users
to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could
achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage
of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For

                                        <span>Over the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MU-MIMO spectral efficiency
have promised to increase data throughput by allowing concurrent communication
between one Access Point and multiple users. However, we are still a long way
from enjoying such MU-MIMO MAC protocol improvements for bandwidth hungry
applications such as video streaming in practical WiFi network settings due to
heterogeneous channel conditions and devices, unreliable transmissions, and
lack of useful feedback exchange among the lower and upper layers&#x27;
requirements. This paper introduces MuViS, a novel dual-phase optimization
framework that proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware MU-MIMO
optimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. MuViS first
employs reinforcement learning to optimize the MU-MIMO user group and mode
selection for users based on their PHY/MAC layer characteristics. The video
bitrate is then optimized based on the user&#x27;s mode (Multi-User (MU) or
Single-User (SU)). We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and
laptops using 802.11ac WiFi. Our experimental results in various indoor
environments and configurations show a scalable framework that can support a
large number of users with streaming at high video rates and satisfying QoE
requirements.</span>

                                        <span>The last-generation video conferencing software allows users to utilize a
virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy
concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other
hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual
background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to
understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays
an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different
kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set
of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint.
In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether
a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the
first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search
for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm
that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector
against different kinds of attacks. This work&#x27;s performance is especially
noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance
especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing,
like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG
compression with different quality factors.</span>

response generation and then the degree of task completion, is essential for
task-oriented dialogue systems. However, the unbalanced distribution of system
actions in dialogue datasets often causes difficulty in learning to generate
desired actions and responses. In this paper, we propose a
retrieve-and-memorize framework to enhance the learning of system actions.
Specially, we first design a neural context-aware retrieval module to retrieve
multiple candidate system actions from the training set given a dialogue
context. Then, we propose a memory-augmented multi-decoder network to generate
the system actions conditioned on the candidate actions, which allows the
network to adaptively select key information in the candidate actions and
ignore noises. We conduct experiments on the large-scale multi-domain
task-oriented dialogue dataset MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1. Experimental
results show that our method achieves competitive performance among several
state-of-the-art models in the context-to-response generation task.</span>

embedding for token replacement purposes, a character-based token classifier
for gender exchange purposes, and a beam search algorithm for extracting the
most fluent combination. Since different approaches are introduced in our
research, we determine a trade-off value for evaluating different models&#x27;
success in faking our gender identification model with transferred text. To
demonstrate our method&#x27;s multilingual applicability, we applied our method on
both English and Persian corpora and ended up defeating our proposed gender
identification model by 45.6% and 39.2%, respectively. While this research&#x27;s
focus is not limited to a specific language, our obtained evaluation results
are highly competitive in an analogy among English state of the art methods.</span>

received increasing attention. The majority of previous work focuses on either
overlapped or discontinuous entities. In this paper, we propose a novel
span-based model that can recognize both overlapped and discontinuous entities
jointly. The model includes two major steps. First, entity fragments are
recognized by traversing over all possible text spans, thus, overlapped
entities can be recognized. Second, we perform relation classification to judge
whether a given pair of entity fragments to be overlapping or succession. In
this way, we can recognize not only discontinuous entities, and meanwhile
doubly check the overlapped entities. As a whole, our model can be regarded as
a relation extraction paradigm essentially. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets (i.e., CLEF, GENIA and ACE05) show that our model is highly
competitive for overlapped and discontinuous NER.</span>

                                        <span>Toxicity detection of text has been a popular NLP task in the recent years.
In SemEval-2021 Task-5 Toxic Spans Detection, the focus is on detecting toxic
spans within passages. Most state-of-the-art span detection approaches employ
various techniques, each of which can be broadly classified into Token
Classification or Span Prediction approaches. In our paper, we explore simple
versions of both of these approaches and their performance on the task.
Specifically, we use BERT-based models -- BERT, RoBERTa, and SpanBERT for both
approaches. We also combine these approaches and modify them to bring
improvements for Toxic Spans prediction. To this end, we investigate results on
four hybrid approaches -- Multi-Span, Span+Token, LSTM-CRF, and a combination
of predicted offsets using union/intersection. Additionally, we perform a
thorough ablative analysis and analyze our observed results. Our best
submission -- a combination of SpanBERT Span Predictor and RoBERTa Token
Classifier predictions -- achieves an F1 score of 0.6753 on the test set. Our
best post-eval F1 score is 0.6895 on intersection of predicted offsets from
top-3 RoBERTa Token Classification checkpoints. These approaches improve the
performance by 3% on average than those of the shared baseline models -- RNNSL
and SpaCy NER.</span>

practice in diagnostic radiology. On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from
the heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind
radiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due
to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a
Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to
imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the
abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and
then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience
accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:
Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and
Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior
knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual
data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge
graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to
alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to
generate the final reports. Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, our
method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on these two
datasets.</span>

Table2Charts framework which learns common patterns from a large corpus of

sequence follows a chart template. On a large spreadsheet corpus with 165k

NLP, there have been several efforts to understand what information such
representations contain. A common strategy to use such representations is to
fine-tune them for an end task. However, how fine-tuning for a task changes the
underlying space is less studied. In this work, we study the English BERT
family and use two probing techniques to analyze how fine-tuning changes the
space. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning improves performance because it
pushes points associated with a label away from other labels. By comparing the
representations before and after fine-tuning, we also discover that fine-tuning
does not change the representations arbitrarily; instead, it adjusts the
representations to downstream tasks while preserving the original structure.
Finally, using carefully constructed experiments, we show that fine-tuning can
encode training sets in a representation, suggesting an overfitting problem of
a new kind.</span>

                                        <span>There is an escalating need for methods to identify latent patterns in text
data from many domains. We introduce a new method to identify topics in a
corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic
Modeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic
modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each.
We first identify a set of vectors (&quot;discourse atoms&quot;) that provide a sparse
representation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent
topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words;
one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate
our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death
incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify
225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical
aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured
variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and
recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias
of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then
compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female
versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of
reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a
flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.</span>

also participate in the textual-only subtask of the same language pair for
which we use mBART, a pretrained multilingual sequence-to-sequence model. For
multimodal translation, we propose to enhance the textual input by bringing the
visual information to a textual domain by extracting object tags from the
image. We also explore the robustness of our system by systematically degrading
the source text. Finally, we achieve a BLEU score of 44.6 and 51.6 on the test
set and challenge set of the multimodal task.</span>

participation in the shared task namely Artificial Intelligence for Legal
Assistance (AILA 2019). This is an integral event of Forum for Information
Retrieval Evaluation-2019. The outcomes of this track would be helpful for the
automation of the working process of the Indian Judiciary System. The manual
working procedures and documentation at any level (from lower to higher court)
of the judiciary system are very complex in nature. The systems produced as a
part of this track would assist the law practitioners. It would be helpful for
common men too. This kind of track also opens the path of research of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in the judicial domain. This track defined two
problems such as Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation
and Task 2: Identifying the most relevant statutes for a given situation. We
tackled both of them. Our proposed approaches are based on BM25 and Doc2Vec. As
per the results declared by the task organizers, we are in 3rd and a modest
position in Task 1 and Task 2 respectively.</span>

Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning. Given a fill-in-the-blank-type
question and a corresponding context, the task is to predict the most suitable
word from a list of 5 options. There are three sub-tasks within this task:
Imperceptibility (subtask-I), Non-Specificity (subtask-II), and Intersection
(subtask-III). We use encoders of transformers-based models pre-trained on the
masked language modelling (MLM) task to build our Fill-in-the-blank (FitB)
models. Moreover, to model imperceptibility, we define certain linguistic
features, and to model non-specificity, we leverage information from hypernyms
and hyponyms provided by a lexical database. Specifically, for non-specificity,
we try out augmentation techniques, and other statistical techniques. We also
propose variants, namely Chunk Voting and Max Context, to take care of input
length restrictions for BERT, etc. Additionally, we perform a thorough ablation
study, and use Integrated Gradients to explain our predictions on a few
samples. Our best submissions achieve accuracies of 75.31% and 77.84%, on the
test sets for subtask-I and subtask-II, respectively. For subtask-III, we
achieve accuracies of 65.64% and 62.27%.</span>

be able to refer to entities actively by natural language. In spatial referring
expression generation, the ambiguity is unavoidable due to the diversity of
reference frames, which will lead to an understanding gap between humans and
robots. To narrow this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel
perspective-corrected spatial referring expression generation (PcSREG) approach
for human-robot interaction by considering the selection of reference frames.
The task of referring expression generation is simplified into the process of
generating diverse spatial relation units. First, we pick out all landmarks in
these spatial relation units according to the entropy of preference and allow
its updating through a stack model. Then all possible referring expressions are
generated according to different reference frame strategies. Finally, we
evaluate every expression using a probabilistic referring expression resolution
model and find the best expression that satisfies both of the appropriateness
and effectiveness. We implement the proposed approach on a robot system and
empirical experiments show that our approach can generate more effective
spatial referring expressions for practical applications.</span>

translation task by the UPC Machine Translation group. The task consists of
building a system capable of translating English audio recordings extracted
from TED talks into German text. Submitted systems can be either cascade or
end-to-end and use a custom or given segmentation. Our submission is an
end-to-end speech translation system, which combines pre-trained models
(Wav2Vec 2.0 and mBART) with coupling modules between the encoder and decoder,
and uses an efficient fine-tuning technique, which trains only 20% of its total
parameters. We show that adding an Adapter to the system and pre-training it,
can increase the convergence speed and the final result, with which we achieve
a BLEU score of 27.3 on the MuST-C test set. Our final model is an ensemble
that obtains 28.22 BLEU score on the same set. Our submission also uses a
custom segmentation algorithm that employs pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 for
identifying periods of untranscribable text and can bring improvements of 2.5
to 3 BLEU score on the IWSLT 2019 test set, as compared to the result with the
given segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Intent classification is a major task in spoken language understanding (SLU).
Since most models are built with pre-collected in-domain (IND) training
utterances, their ability to detect unsupported out-of-domain (OOD) utterances
has a critical effect in practical use. Recent works have shown that using
extra data and labels can improve the OOD detection performance, yet it could
be costly to collect such data. This paper proposes to train a model with only
IND data while supporting both IND intent classification and OOD detection. Our
method designs a novel domain-regularized module (DRM) to reduce the
overconfident phenomenon of a vanilla classifier, achieving a better
generalization in both cases. Besides, DRM can be used as a drop-in replacement
for the last layer in any neural network-based intent classifier, providing a
low-cost strategy for a significant improvement. The evaluation on four
datasets shows that our method built on BERT and RoBERTa models achieves
state-of-the-art performance against existing approaches and the strong
baselines we created for the comparisons.</span>

                                        <span>Target speech separation is the process of filtering a certain speaker&#x27;s
voice out of speech mixtures according to the additional speaker identity
information provided. Recent works have made considerable improvement by
processing signals in the time domain directly. The majority of them take fully
overlapped speech mixtures for training. However, since most real-life
conversations occur randomly and are sparsely overlapped, we argue that
training with different overlap ratio data benefits. To do so, an unavoidable
problem is that the popularly used SI-SNR loss has no definition for silent
sources. This paper proposes the weighted SI-SNR loss, together with the joint
learning of target speech separation and personal VAD. The weighted SI-SNR loss
imposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker&#x27;s duration
and returns zero when the target speaker is absent. Meanwhile, the personal VAD
generates masks and sets non-target speech to silence. Experiments show that
our proposed method outperforms the baseline by 1.73 dB in terms of SDR on
fully overlapped speech, as well as by 4.17 dB and 0.9 dB on sparsely
overlapped speech of clean and noisy conditions. Besides, with slight
degradation in performance, our model could reduce the time costs in inference.</span>

can enable the use of radiology report information for a variety of critical
healthcare applications. In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of
entities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a
novel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.
We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist
annotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579
entities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two
independent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology
reports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these
datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR
and CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference
dataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph
Benchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4
million relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908

                                        <span>We generalize deep self-attention distillation in MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020)
by only using self-attention relation distillation for task-agnostic
compression of pretrained Transformers. In particular, we define multi-head
self-attention relations as scaled dot-product between the pairs of query, key,
and value vectors within each self-attention module. Then we employ the above
relational knowledge to train the student model. Besides its simplicity and
unified principle, more favorably, there is no restriction in terms of the
number of student&#x27;s attention heads, while most previous work has to guarantee
the same head number between teacher and student. Moreover, the fine-grained
self-attention relations tend to fully exploit the interaction knowledge
learned by Transformer. In addition, we thoroughly examine the layer selection
strategy for teacher models, rather than just relying on the last layer as in
MiniLM. We conduct extensive experiments on compressing both monolingual and
multilingual pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that our
models distilled from base-size and large-size teachers (BERT, RoBERTa and
XLM-R) outperform the state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Learning vector representations for words is one of the most fundamental
topics in NLP, capable of capturing syntactic and semantic relationships useful
in a variety of downstream NLP tasks. Vector representations can be limiting,
however, in that typical scoring such as dot product similarity intertwines
position and magnitude of the vector in space. Exciting innovations in the
space of representation learning have proposed alternative fundamental
representations, such as distributions, hyperbolic vectors, or regions. Our
model, Word2Box, takes a region-based approach to the problem of word
representation, representing words as $n$-dimensional rectangles. These
representations encode position and breadth independently and provide
additional geometric operations such as intersection and containment which
allow them to model co-occurrence patterns vectors struggle with. We
demonstrate improved performance on various word similarity tasks, particularly
on less common words, and perform a qualitative analysis exploring the
additional unique expressivity provided by Word2Box.</span>

best fits a provided dataset of input and output values. Due to the richness of
the space of mathematical expressions, symbolic regression is generally a
challenging problem. While conventional approaches based on genetic evolution
algorithms have been used for decades, deep learning-based methods are
relatively new and an active research area. In this work, we present
SymbolicGPT, a novel transformer-based language model for symbolic regression.
This model exploits the advantages of probabilistic language models like GPT,
including strength in performance and flexibility. Through comprehensive
experiments, we show that our model performs strongly compared to competing
models with respect to the accuracy, running time, and data efficiency.</span>

During manualtuning, the authors used the LLVM tools to improve code
parallelization by using OpenMP SIMD,refactored the code and applied
transformation that enabled SIMD optimizations, and ensured thatthe correct

analysis is investigated based on the use of the deep neural network model
BERT. The experiments with review corpora allow us to conclude that on average

notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

natural language into SQL. Solutions from traditional NLP methodology focuses
on grammar rule pattern learning and pairing via intermediate logic forms.
Although those methods give an acceptable performance on certain specific
database and parsing tasks, they are hard to generalize and scale. On the other
hand, recent progress in neural deep learning seems to provide a promising
direction towards building a general NLIDB system. Unlike the traditional
approach, those neural methodologies treat the parsing problem as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem. In this paper, we experimented on

on high-resource languages like English, mostly due to the limited availability
of datasets for low/mid-resource ones. In this work, we present XL-Sum, a
comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 1 million professionally annotated
article-summary pairs from BBC, extracted using a set of carefully designed
heuristics. The dataset covers 44 languages ranging from low to high-resource,
for many of which no public dataset is currently available. XL-Sum is highly
abstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic
evaluation. We fine-tune mT5, a state-of-the-art pretrained multilingual model,
with XL-Sum and experiment on multilingual and low-resource summarization
tasks. XL-Sum induces competitive results compared to the ones obtained using
similar monolingual datasets: we show higher than 11 ROUGE-2 scores on 10
languages we benchmark on, with some of them exceeding 15, as obtained by
multilingual training. Additionally, training on low-resource languages
individually also provides competitive performance. To the best of our
knowledge, XL-Sum is the largest abstractive summarization dataset in terms of
the number of samples collected from a single source and the number of
languages covered. We are releasing our dataset and models to encourage future
research on multilingual abstractive summarization. The resources can be found

challenging issues in natural language processing; specifically, in low
resource languages such as Persian. In this research we prepare a causality
human annotated corpus for the Persian language which consists of 4446
sentences and 5128 causal relations and three labels of cause, effect and
causal mark -- if possibl -- are specified for each relation. We have used this
corpus to train a system for detecting causal elements boundaries. Also, we
present a causality detection benchmark for three machine learning methods and
two deep learning systems based on this corpus. Performance evaluations
indicate that our best total result is obtained through CRF classifier which
has F-measure of 0.76 and the best accuracy obtained through Bi-LSTM-CRF deep
learning method with Accuracy equal to %91.4.</span>

                                        <span>Argumentation mining is a field of computational linguistics that is devoted
to extracting from texts and classifying arguments and relations between them,
as well as constructing an argumentative structure. A significant obstacle to
research in this area for the Russian language is the lack of annotated
Russian-language text corpora. This article explores the possibility of
improving the quality of argumentation mining using the extension of the
Russian-language version of the Argumentative Microtext Corpus (ArgMicro) based
on the machine translation of the Persuasive Essays Corpus (PersEssays). To
make it possible to use these two corpora combined, we propose a Joint Argument
Annotation Scheme based on the schemes used in ArgMicro and PersEssays. We
solve the problem of classifying argumentative discourse units (ADUs) into two
classes - &quot;pro&quot; (&quot;for&quot;) and &quot;opp&quot; (&quot;against&quot;) using traditional machine
learning techniques (SVM, Bagging and XGBoost) and a deep neural network (BERT
model). An ensemble of XGBoost and BERT models was proposed, which showed the
highest performance of ADUs classification for both corpora.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, reference-based and supervised summarization evaluation
metrics have been widely explored. However, collecting human-annotated
references and ratings are costly and time-consuming. To avoid these
limitations, we propose a training-free and reference-free summarization
evaluation metric. Our metric consists of a centrality-weighted relevance score
and a self-referenced redundancy score. The relevance score is computed between
the pseudo reference built from the source document and the given summary,
where the pseudo reference content is weighted by the sentence centrality to
provide importance guidance. Besides an $F_1$-based relevance score, we also
design an $F_\beta$-based variant that pays more attention to the recall score.
As for the redundancy score of the summary, we compute a self-masked similarity
score with the summary itself to evaluate the redundant information in the
summary. Finally, we combine the relevance and redundancy scores to produce the
final evaluation score of the given summary. Extensive experiments show that
our methods can significantly outperform existing methods on both
multi-document and single-document summarization evaluation.</span>

of the knowledge graph by inferring from the facts contained in it. Recent work
in link prediction has attempted to provide a model for increasing link
prediction accuracy by using more layers in neural network architecture or
methods that add to the computational complexity of models. This paper we
proposed a method for refining the knowledge graph, which makes the knowledge
graph more informative, and link prediction operations can be performed more
accurately using relatively fast translational models. Translational link
prediction models, such as TransE, TransH, TransD, etc., have much less
complexity than deep learning approaches. This method uses the hierarchy of
relationships and also the hierarchy of entities in the knowledge graph to add
the entity information as a new entity to the graph and connect it to the nodes
which contain this information in their hierarchy. Our experiments show that
our method can significantly increase the performance of translational link
prediction methods in H@10, MR, MRR.</span>

diagnosis of medical conditions such as depression, using a collection of a
person&#x27;s utterances. Depression is a serious medical illness that can have
adverse effects on how one feels, thinks, and acts, which can lead to emotional
and physical problems. Due to the sensitive nature of such data, privacy
measures need to be taken for handling and training models with such data. In
this work, we study the effects that the application of Differential Privacy
(DP) has, in both a centralized and a Federated Learning (FL) setup, on
training contextualized language models (BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT).
We offer insights on how to privately train NLP models and what architectures
and setups provide more desirable privacy utility trade-offs. We envisage this
work to be used in future healthcare and mental health studies to keep medical
history private. Therefore, we provide an open-source implementation of this

                                        <span>In the field of inorganic materials science, there is a growing demand to
extract knowledge such as physical properties and synthesis processes of
materials by machine-reading a large number of papers. This is because
materials researchers refer to many papers in order to come up with promising
terms of experiments for material synthesis. However, there are only a few
systems that can extract material names and their properties. This study
proposes a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for
extracting material names and properties from materials science literature to
enable the search and retrieval of results in materials science. Therefore, we
propose a label definition for extracting material names and properties and
accordingly build a corpus containing 836 annotated paragraphs extracted from
301 papers for training a named entity recognition (NER) model. Experimental
results demonstrate the utility of this NER model; it achieves successful
extraction with a micro-F1 score of 78.1%. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, we present a thorough evaluation on a real-world automatically
annotated corpus by applying our trained NER model to 12,895 materials science
papers. We analyze the trend in materials science by visualizing the outputs of
the NLP pipeline. For example, the country-by-year analysis indicates that in
recent years, the number of papers on &quot;MoS2,&quot; a material used in perovskite
solar cells, has been increasing rapidly in China but decreasing in the United
States. Further, according to the conditions-by-year analysis, the processing
temperature of the catalyst material &quot;PEDOT:PSS&quot; is shifting below 200 degree,
and the number of reports with a processing time exceeding 5 h is increasing
slightly.</span>

                                        <span>Extracting relational triples from texts is a fundamental task in knowledge
graph construction. The popular way of existing methods is to jointly extract
entities and relations using a single model, which often suffers from the
overlapping triple problem. That is, there are multiple relational triples that
share the same entities within one sentence. In this work, we propose an
effective cascade dual-decoder approach to extract overlapping relational
triples, which includes a text-specific relation decoder and a
relation-corresponded entity decoder. Our approach is straightforward: the
text-specific relation decoder detects relations from a sentence according to
its text semantics and treats them as extra features to guide the entity
extraction; for each extracted relation, which is with trainable embedding, the
relation-corresponded entity decoder detects the corresponding head and tail
entities using a span-based tagging scheme. In this way, the overlapping triple
problem is tackled naturally. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves
better F1 scores under the strict evaluation metric. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/prastunlp/DualDec.</span>

                                        <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and
simulating problems across a wide range of disciplines. Recent advances in deep
learning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis.
However, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs,
pose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations.
Moreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via
penalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this
end, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning
architectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled
data. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory
network is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal
evolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized
PDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure
forcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are
further enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly
simulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been
assessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers&#x27; equations, the
$\lambda$-$\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and
compared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms. The numerical
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in the context
of solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we
advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers
real-world deployment.</span>

                                        <span>Explainable machine learning models primarily justify predicted labels using
either extractive rationales (i.e., subsets of input features) or free-text
natural language explanations (NLEs) as abstractive justifications. While NLEs
can be more comprehensive than extractive rationales, machine-generated NLEs
have been shown to sometimes lack commonsense knowledge. Here, we show that
commonsense knowledge can act as a bridge between extractive rationales and
NLEs, rendering both types of explanations better. More precisely, we introduce
a unified framework, called RExC (Rationale-Inspired Explanations with
Commonsense), that (1) extracts rationales as a set of features responsible for
machine predictions, (2) expands the extractive rationales using available
commonsense resources, and (3) uses the expanded knowledge to generate natural
language explanations. Our framework surpasses by a large margin the previous
state-of-the-art in generating NLEs across five tasks in both natural language
processing and vision-language understanding, with human annotators
consistently rating the explanations generated by RExC to be more
comprehensive, grounded in commonsense, and overall preferred compared to
previous state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our work shows that
commonsense-grounded explanations can enhance both task performance and
rationales extraction capabilities.</span>

                                        <span>Forming and interpreting abstraction is a core process in human
communication. In particular, when giving and performing complex instructions
stated in natural language (NL), people may naturally evoke abstract constructs
such as objects, loops, conditions and functions to convey their intentions in
an efficient and precise way. Yet, interpreting and grounding abstraction
stated in NL has not been systematically studied in NLP/AI. To elicit
naturally-occurring abstractions in NL we develop the Hexagons referential
game, where players describe increasingly complex images on a two-dimensional
Hexagons board, and other players need to follow these instructions to recreate
the images. Using this game we collected the Hexagons dataset, which consists
of 164 images and over 3000 naturally-occurring instructions, rich with diverse
abstractions. Results of our baseline models on an instruction-to-execution
task derived from the Hexagons dataset confirm that higher-level abstractions
in NL are indeed more challenging for current systems to process. Thus, this
dataset exposes a new and challenging dimension for grounded semantic parsing,
and we propose it for the community as a future benchmark to explore more
sophisticated and high-level communication within NLP applications.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel multi-view training framework and CNN architecture for
combining information from multiple overlapping satellite images and noisy
training labels derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically label
buildings and roads across large geographic regions (100 km$^2$). Our approach
to multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class
IoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views
independently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of
our system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for
learning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference
with a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that
the benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of
the network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of
the GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per
scene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates
comparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first
training them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the
predicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our
IoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively
which are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that
are not completely automated.</span>

                                        <span>Low-dose CT has been a key diagnostic imaging modality to reduce the
potential risk of radiation overdose to patient health. Despite recent
advances, CNN-based approaches typically apply filters in a spatially invariant
way and adopt similar pixel-level losses, which treat all regions of the CT
image equally and can be inefficient when fine-grained structures coexist with
non-uniformly distributed noises. To address this issue, we propose a
Structure-preserving Kernel Prediction Network (StructKPN) that combines the
kernel prediction network with a structure-aware loss function that utilizes
the pixel gradient statistics and guides the model towards spatially-variant
filters that enhance noise removal, prevent over-smoothing and preserve
detailed structures for different regions in CT imaging. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach achieved superior performance on both synthetic
and non-synthetic datasets, and better preserves structures that are highly
desired in clinical screening and low-dose protocol optimization.</span>

labeled input data, but DNNs sometimes fail to generalize to test data sampled
from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)
proves useful when no input labels are available, and distribution shifts are
observed in the target domain (TD). Experiments are performed on seismic images
of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and
Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological
classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. In
the present study, an improved deep neural network architecture named
EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images. We
specifically use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated
convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy &gt;84%
and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance
compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduced the CORAL
(Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain
adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections
fromF3 and Penobscot. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of
Penobscot with &gt;50% overall accuracy. Taken together, EAN-DDA has the potential
to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</span>

several pipelines have been proposed in the same direction. Yet, the task lacks
quality datasets to illustrate the contribution of visual modality in the
translation systems. In this paper, we propose our system under the team name
Volta for the Multimodal Translation Task of WAT 2021 from English to Hindi. We
also participate in the textual-only subtask of the same language pair for
which we use mBART, a pretrained multilingual sequence-to-sequence model. For
multimodal translation, we propose to enhance the textual input by bringing the
visual information to a textual domain by extracting object tags from the
image. We also explore the robustness of our system by systematically degrading
the source text. Finally, we achieve a BLEU score of 44.6 and 51.6 on the test

                                        <span>Attention mechanism has shown enormous potential for single image
super-resolution (SISR). However, existing works only proposed some attention
mechanism for a specific network. A universal attention mechanism for SISR,
which could further improve the performance of networks without attention and
provide a baseline for networks with attention, is still lacking. To fit this
gap, we propose a lightweight and efficient Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM),
which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial
Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. The information extraction mechanism of
ACAM and MSAM effectively filters redundant information, making the overall
structure of BAM very lightweight. Owing to the parallel structure, during the
gradient backpropagation process of BAM, ACAM and MSAM not only conduct
self-optimization, but also mutual optimization so as to generate more balanced
attention information. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we
applied it to 12 state-ofthe-art SISR networks. The results on 4 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks&#x27;
performance, and for those with attention, the substitution with BAM further
reduces the amount of parameters and increase the inference speed. Moreover,
ablation experiments were conducted to prove the minimalism of BAM.</span>

bounded regions, properties of the sub-optimal and equilibrium distributions of

                                        <span>Attention has been proved to be an efficient mechanism to capture long-range
dependencies. However, so far it has not been deployed in invertible networks.
This is due to the fact that in order to make a network invertible, every
component within the network needs to be a bijective transformation, but a
normal attention block is not. In this paper, we propose invertible attention
that can be plugged into existing invertible models. We mathematically and
experimentally prove that the invertibility of an attention model can be
achieved by carefully constraining its Lipschitz constant. We validate the
invertibility of our invertible attention on image reconstruction task with 3
popular datasets: CIFAR-10, SVHN, and CelebA. We also show that our invertible
attention achieves similar performance in comparison with normal non-invertible
attention on dense prediction tasks. The code is available at

                                        <span>Rotated object detection is a challenging issue of computer vision field.
Loss of spatial information and confusion of parametric order have been the
bottleneck for rotated detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose an
orientation-sensitive keypoint based rotated detector OSKDet. We adopt a set of
keypoints to characterize the target and predict the keypoint heatmap on ROI to
form a rotated target. By proposing the orientation-sensitive heatmap, OSKDet
could learn the shape and direction of rotated target implicitly and has
stronger modeling capabilities for target representation, which improves the
localization accuracy and acquires high quality detection results. To extract
highly effective features at border areas, we design a rotation-aware
deformable convolution module. Furthermore, we explore a new keypoint reorder
algorithm and feature fusion module based on the angle distribution to
eliminate the confusion of keypoint order. Experimental results on several
public benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of OSKDet.
Specifically, we achieve an AP of 77.81% on DOTA, 89.91% on HRSC2016, and
97.18% on UCAS-AOD, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Automatically generating radiology reports can improve current clinical
practice in diagnostic radiology. On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from
the heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind
radiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due
to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a
Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to
imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the
abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and
then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience
accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:
Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and
Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior
knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual
data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge
graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to
alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to
generate the final reports. Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, our
method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on these two
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>We present a learning-based method for building driving-signal aware
full-body avatars. Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can
be animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial
keypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and
view-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better
drivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving
signals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during
animation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the
driving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the
remaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors
required during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving
signal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving
signal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence
of global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving
signal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty
for missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a
particular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the
challenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with
driving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and
mounted on a VR-headset.</span>

                                        <span>The transformer networks are particularly good at modeling long-range
dependencies within a long sequence. In this paper, we conduct research on
applying the transformer networks for salient object detection (SOD). We adopt
the dense transformer backbone for fully supervised RGB image based SOD, RGB-D
image pair based SOD, and weakly supervised SOD within a unified framework
based on the observation that the transformer backbone can provide accurate
structure modeling, which makes it powerful in learning from weak labels with
less structure information. Further, we find that the vision transformer
architectures do not offer direct spatial supervision, instead encoding
position as a feature. Therefore, we investigate the contributions of two
strategies to provide stronger spatial supervision through the transformer
layers within our unified framework, namely deep supervision and
difficulty-aware learning. We find that deep supervision can get gradients back
into the higher level features, thus leads to uniform activation within the
same semantic object. Difficulty-aware learning on the other hand is capable of
identifying the hard pixels for effective hard negative mining. We also
visualize features of conventional backbone and transformer backbone before and
after fine-tuning them for SOD, and find that transformer backbone encodes more
accurate object structure information and more distinct semantic information
within the lower and higher level features respectively. We also apply our
model to camouflaged object detection (COD) and achieve similar observations as
the above three SOD tasks. Extensive experimental results on various SOD and
COD tasks illustrate that transformer networks can transform SOD and COD,
leading to new benchmarks for each related task. The source code and
experimental results are available via our project page:

engineering along with the API recommendation systems and relevant libraries to
be used. In this context, the existing tools like SentiCR, SentiStrength-SE,
etc. exhibited low f1-scores that completely defeats the purpose of deployment
of such strategies, thereby there is enough scope for performance improvement.
Recent advancements show that transformer based pre-trained models (e.g., BERT,
RoBERTa, ALBERT, etc.) have displayed better results in the text classification
task. Following this context, the present research explores different
BERT-based models to analyze the sentences in GitHub comments, Jira comments,

analyse BERT based model for sentiment analysis, where in the first strategy
the BERT based pre-trained models are fine-tuned; in the second strategy an
ensemble model is developed from BERT variants, and in the third strategy a
compressed model (Distil BERT) is used. The experimental results show that the

                                        <span>The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven
research towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using
only image-level, point, or box labels. The lack of dense scene representation
requires methods to increase complexity to obtain additional semantic
information about the scene, often done through multiple stages of training and
refinement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models leverage image-level labels
to produce class activation maps (CAMs) which go through multiple stages of
refinement before they are thresholded to make pseudo-masks for supervision.
The multi-stage approach is computationally expensive, and dependency on
image-level labels for CAMs generation lacks generalizability to more complex
scenes. In contrary, our method offers a single-stage approach generalizable to
arbitrary dataset, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on
pre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize
point annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined
and filtered features. While our method requires point annotations that are
only slightly more expensive than image-level annotations, we are to
demonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as
significantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets

                                        <span>Channel Pruning has been long studied to compress CNNs for efficient image
classification. Prior works implement channel pruning in an unexplainable
manner, which tends to reduce the final classification errors while failing to
consider the internal influence of each channel. In this paper, we conduct
channel pruning in a white box. Through deep visualization of feature maps
activated by different channels, we observe that different channels have a
varying contribution to different categories in image classification. Inspired
by this, we choose to preserve channels contributing to most categories.
Specifically, to model the contribution of each channel to differentiating
categories, we develop a class-wise mask for each channel, implemented in a
dynamic training manner w.r.t. the input image&#x27;s category. On the basis of the
learned class-wise mask, we perform a global voting mechanism to remove
channels with less category discrimination. Lastly, a fine-tuning process is
conducted to recover the performance of the pruned model. To our best
knowledge, it is the first time that CNN interpretability theory is considered
to guide channel pruning. Extensive experiments on representative image
classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our White-Box over many
state-of-the-arts. For instance, on CIFAR-10, it reduces 65.23% FLOPs with even
0.62% accuracy improvement for ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, White-Box achieves a
45.6% FLOPs reduction with only a small loss of 0.83% in the top-1 accuracy for
ResNet-50.</span>

                                        <span>The rapid progress in 3D scene understanding has come with growing demand for
data; however, collecting and annotating 3D scenes (e.g. point clouds) are
notoriously hard. For example, the number of scenes (e.g. indoor rooms) that
can be accessed and scanned might be limited; even given sufficient data,
acquiring 3D labels (e.g. instance masks) requires intensive human labor. In
this paper, we explore data-efficient learning for 3D point cloud. As a first
step towards this direction, we propose Contrastive Scene Contexts, a 3D
pre-training method that makes use of both point-level correspondences and
spatial contexts in a scene. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on a
suite of benchmarks where training data or labels are scarce. Our study reveals
that exhaustive labelling of 3D point clouds might be unnecessary; and
remarkably, on ScanNet, even using 0.1% of point labels, we still achieve 89%
(instance segmentation) and 96% (semantic segmentation) of the baseline
performance that uses full annotations.</span>

DJI Mavic Pro quadcopters, after Hurricane Harvey. The dataset presents a
unique challenge of advancing the damage assessment process for post-disaster
scenarios using unlabeled and limited labeled dataset. We propose a solution to
address their classification and semantic segmentation challenge. We approach
this problem by generating pseudo labels for both classification and
segmentation during training and slowly incrementing the amount by which the
pseudo label loss affects the final loss. Using this semi-supervised method of
training helped us improve our baseline supervised loss by a huge margin for
classification, allowing the model to generalize and perform better on the
validation and test splits of the dataset. In this paper, we compare and

supervised pre-trained for transfer learning. By synthesizing annotations on
pretext tasks, self-supervision allows to pre-train models on large amounts of
pseudo-labels before fine-tuning them on the target task. In this work, we
assess self-supervision for the diagnosis of skin lesions, comparing three
self-supervised pipelines to a challenging supervised baseline, on five test

self-supervision is competitive both in improving accuracies and in reducing

assessment (IQA), held in conjunction with the New Trends in Image Restoration
and Enhancement workshop (NTIRE) workshop at CVPR 2021. As a new type of image
processing technology, perceptual image processing algorithms based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have produced images with more realistic
textures. These output images have completely different characteristics from
traditional distortions, thus pose a new challenge for IQA methods to evaluate
their visual quality. In comparison with previous IQA challenges, the training
and testing datasets in this challenge include the outputs of perceptual image
processing algorithms and the corresponding subjective scores. Thus they can be
used to develop and evaluate IQA methods on GAN-based distortions. The
challenge has 270 registered participants in total. In the final testing stage,
13 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all of
them have achieved much better results than existing IQA methods, while the
winning method can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.</span>

and Chinese offline handwritten text line images. As far as we know, it is the
first approach that adopts the RNN-Transducer model for offline handwritten
text recognition. The proposed model consists of three main components: a
visual feature encoder that extracts visual features from an input image by CNN
and then encodes the visual features by BLSTM; a linguistic context encoder
that extracts and encodes linguistic features from the input image by embedded
layers and LSTM; and a joint decoder that combines and then decodes the visual
features and the linguistic features into the final label sequence by fully
connected and softmax layers. The proposed model takes advantage of both visual
and linguistic information from the input image. In the experiments, we
evaluated the performance of the proposed model on the two datasets: Kuzushiji
and SCUT-EPT. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.</span>

                                        <span>A table arranging data in rows and columns is a very effective data
structure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research.
Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic
table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis
community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it
remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a
variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a
table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different
table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table
cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the
table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition
as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table
graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.
Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection
branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial
location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on
three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph
annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
TGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made
publicly available.</span>

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) task. In this work, we present Multi-Modal
Mutual Enhancement Module (M3EM), a deep module for jointly considering
information from multiple modalities to find the most transferable
representations across domains. We achieve this by implementing two sub-modules
for enhancing each modality using the context of other modalities. The first
sub-module exchanges information across modalities through the semantic space,
while the second sub-module finds the most transferable spatial region based on
the consensus of all modalities.</span>

system, which is used to perceive the surrounding world. While making a
prediction, the human brain tends to relate crucial cues from multiple sources
of information. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion module that
learns to emphasize more contributive features across all modalities.
Specifically, the proposed Multimodal Split Attention Fusion (MSAF) module
splits each modality into channel-wise equal feature blocks and creates a joint
representation that is used to generate soft attention for each channel across
the feature blocks. Further, the MSAF module is designed to be compatible with
features of various spatial dimensions and sequence lengths, suitable for both
CNNs and RNNs. Thus, MSAF can be easily added to fuse features of any unimodal
networks and utilize existing pretrained unimodal model weights. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our fusion module, we design three multimodal networks
with MSAF for emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition
tasks. Our approach achieves competitive results in each task and outperforms
other application-specific networks and multimodal fusion benchmarks.</span>

the power loads&#x27; appliance-by-appliance from the whole consumption measured by
a single meter. In this paper, we propose a conditional density estimation
model, based on deep neural networks, that joins a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder with a Conditional Invertible Normalizing Flow model to estimate
the individual appliance&#x27;s power demand. The resulting model is called Prior
Flow Variational Autoencoder or, for simplicity PFVAE. Thus, instead of having
one model per appliance, the resulting model is responsible for estimating the
power demand, appliance-by-appliance, at once. We train and evaluate our
proposed model in a publicly available dataset composed of power demand
measures from a poultry feed factory located in Brazil. The proposed model&#x27;s
quality is evaluated by comparing the obtained normalized disaggregation error
(NDE) and signal aggregated error (SAE) with the previous work values on the

the eight machines belonging to the dataset, we observe consistent improvements

(DR), a frequent complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment
and blindness. Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides
real-time retinal images with resolution down to 2 $\mu m$ and thus allows
detection of the morphologies of individual MAs, a potential marker that might
dictate MA pathology and affect the progression of DR. In contrast to the
numerous automatic models developed for assessing the number of MAs on fundus
photographs, currently there is no high throughput image protocol available for
automatic analysis of AOSLO photographs. To address this urgency, we introduce
AOSLO-net, a deep neural network framework with customized training policies to
automatically segment MAs from AOSLO images. We evaluate the performance of
AOSLO-net using 87 DR AOSLO images and our results demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation model both in
accuracy and cost and enables correct MA morphological classification.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer, which can benefit from global (long-range) information modeling
using self-attention mechanisms, has been successful in natural language
processing and 2D image classification recently. However, both local and global
features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical
image segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in
3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named
TransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D
context information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the
volumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed
elaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature
modeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and
performs progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map.
Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that
TransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art
3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans. The source code is

                                        <span>Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically
based on supervised learning, which requires a large number of ground-truth
labels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive
to obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor
disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and
consistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time.
Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a
multivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI
and a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across
acquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by
self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce
change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this
model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard
autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the
image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to
highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and
revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and
neuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL
facilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher
(or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation
learning techniques.</span>

                                        <span>In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel
arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is
represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts
an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two
novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:
factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to
build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs
for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to
complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the
performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing
the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we
explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like
out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation,
accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate
outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior. The project page is

                                        <span>There are many real-life use cases such as barcode scanning or billboard
reading where people need to detect objects and read the object contents.
Commonly existing methods are first trying to localize object regions, then
determine layout and lastly classify content units. However, for simple fixed
structured objects like license plates, this approach becomes overkill and
lengthy to run. This work aims to solve this detect-and-read problem in a
lightweight way by integrating multi-digit recognition into a one-stage object
detection model. Our unified method not only eliminates the duplication in
feature extraction (one for localizing, one again for classifying) but also
provides useful contextual information around object regions for
classification. Additionally, our choice of backbones and modifications in
architecture, loss function, data augmentation and training make the method
robust, efficient and speedy. Secondly, we made a public benchmark dataset of
diverse real-life 1D barcodes for a reliable evaluation, which we collected,
annotated and checked carefully. Eventually, experimental results prove the
method&#x27;s efficiency on the barcode problem by outperforming industrial tools in
both detecting and decoding rates with a real-time fps at a VGA-similar
resolution. It also did a great job expectedly on the license-plate recognition
task (on the AOLP dataset) by outperforming the current state-of-the-art method
significantly in terms of recognition rate and inference time.</span>

                                        <span>Object recognition in the real-world requires handling long-tailed or even
open-ended data. An ideal visual system needs to recognize the populated head
visual concepts reliably and meanwhile efficiently learn about emerging new
tail categories with a few training instances. Class-balanced many-shot
learning and few-shot learning tackle one side of this problem, by either
learning strong classifiers for head or learning to learn few-shot classifiers
for the tail. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot
learning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about
tail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes. We
propose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (CASTLE), a learning framework that
learns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the
multi-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary,
shedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive
version of CASTLE (ACASTLE) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the
incoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective
backward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with
classes from heterogeneous domains effectively. CASTLE and ACASTLE demonstrate
superior performances than existing GFSL algorithms and strong baselines on
MiniImageNet as well as TieredImageNet datasets. More interestingly, they
outperform previous state-of-the-art methods when evaluated with standard
few-shot learning criteria.</span>

                                        <span>Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a classification task that points to
face variants. Hence, there are certain affinity features between facial
expressions, receiving little attention in the FER literature. Convolution
padding, despite helping capture the edge information, causes erosion of the
feature map simultaneously. After multi-layer filling convolution, the output
feature map named albino feature definitely weakens the representation of the
expression. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named
Amending Representation Module (ARM). ARM is a substitute for the pooling
layer. Theoretically, it can be embedded in the back end of any network to deal
with the Padding Erosion. ARM efficiently enhances facial expression
representation from two different directions: 1) reducing the weight of eroded
features to offset the side effect of padding, and 2) sharing affinity features
over mini-batch to strengthen the representation learning. Experiments on
public benchmarks prove that our ARM boosts the performance of FER remarkably.
The validation accuracies are respectively 92.05% on RAF-DB, 65.2% on
Affect-Net, and 58.71% on SFEW, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods. Our
implementation and trained models are available at

                                        <span>Indoor panorama typically consists of human-made structures parallel or
perpendicular to gravity. We leverage this phenomenon to approximate the scene
in a 360-degree image with (H)orizontal-planes and (V)ertical-planes. To this
end, we propose an effective divide-and-conquer strategy that divides pixels
based on their plane orientation estimation; then, the succeeding instance
segmentation module conquers the task of planes clustering more easily in each
plane orientation group. Besides, parameters of V-planes depend on camera yaw
rotation, but translation-invariant CNNs are less aware of the yaw change. We
thus propose a yaw-invariant V-planar reparameterization for CNNs to learn. We
create a benchmark for indoor panorama planar reconstruction by extending
existing 360 depth datasets with ground truth H\&amp;V-planes (referred to as
PanoH&amp;V dataset) and adopt state-of-the-art planar reconstruction methods to
predict H\&amp;V-planes as our baselines. Our method outperforms the baselines by a

fixed mapping rules between inputs and outputs, thereby limiting their
application in more complex and dynamic situations in which the mapping rules
are not kept the same but changing according to different contexts. To lift
such limits, we developed a novel approach involving a learning algorithm,
called orthogonal weights modification (OWM), with the addition of a
context-dependent processing (CDP) module. We demonstrated that with OWM to
overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, and the CDP module to learn
how to reuse a feature representation and a classifier for different contexts,
a single network can acquire numerous context-dependent mapping rules in an
online and continual manner, with as few as $\sim$10 samples to learn each.
This should enable highly compact systems to gradually learn myriad
regularities of the real world and eventually behave appropriately within it.</span>

their gripper and tactile sensing is often necessary in tasks that involve
contact-rich motion. In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in
touch feedback to guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement
learning tasks. Our approach, Touch-based Curiosity (ToC), learns what visible
objects interactions are supposed to &quot;feel&quot; like. We encourage exploration by
rewarding interactions where the expectation and the experience don&#x27;t match. In
our proposed method, an initial task-independent exploration phase is followed
by an on-task learning phase, in which the original interactions are relabeled
with on-task rewards. We test our approach on a range of touch-intensive robot
arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as part
of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we
demonstrate that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through
sparse reward and curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to
single-modality (touch- or vision-only) approaches as well as other

datasets, which make it hard to identify durable and generalizable scientific

classification with a new large-scale training and testing dataset, SF300,
including both vertical and oblique aerial images and made available to the
research community, and an associated fine-tuning method. We additionally
propose a new adversarial fine-tuning method for global descriptors. We show

                                        <span>Image registration has been widely studied over the past several decades,
with numerous applications in science, engineering and medicine. Most of the
conventional mathematical models for large deformation image registration rely
on prescribed landmarks, which usually require tedious manual labeling and are
prone to error. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the use
of machine learning for image registration. In this paper, we develop a novel
method for large deformation image registration by a fusion of quasiconformal
theory and convolutional neural network (CNN). More specifically, we propose a
quasiconformal energy model with a novel fidelity term that incorporates the
features extracted using a pre-trained CNN, thereby allowing us to obtain
meaningful registration results without any guidance of prescribed landmarks.
Moreover, unlike many prior image registration methods, the bijectivity of our
method is guaranteed by quasiconformal theory. Experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. More
broadly, our work sheds light on how rigorous mathematical theories and
practical machine learning approaches can be integrated for developing
computational methods with improved performance.</span>

approach for pixel-wise image segmentation. In this work, we tackle two defects
that hinder their deployment in real-world applications: 1) Predictions lack
uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems;
2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive
hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we
demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that
achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using
significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture
combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions,
bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference
for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best
performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse

proprocessed using segmentation techniques to filter out images of closed lung,

select one or multiple sets of a fixed number of slice images for training and
validation. A 3D CNN network with BERT is used to classify this set of selected
slice images. In this network, an embedding feature is also extracted. In cases
where there are more than one set of slice images in a volume, the features of
all sets are extracted and pooled into a global feature vector for the whole
CT-scan volume. A simple multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) network is used to
further classify the aggregated feature vector. The models are trained and
evaluated on the provided training and validation datasets. On the validation

since these might lead to biased performances, threatens the user&#x27;s privacy, or
are valuable for commercial aspects. Current face databases are specifically
constructed for the development of face recognition applications. Consequently,
these databases contain large amount of face images but lack in the number of
attribute annotations and the overall annotation correctness. In this work, we
propose MAADFace, a new face annotations database that is characterized by the
large number of its high-quality attribute annotations. MAADFace is build on
the VGGFace2 database and thus, consists of 3.3M faces of over 9k individuals.
Using a novel annotation transfer-pipeline that allows an accurate
label-transfer from multiple source-datasets to a target-dataset, MAAD-Face
consists of 123.9M attribute annotations of 47 different binary attributes.
Consequently, it provides 15 and 137 times more attribute labels than CelebA
and LFW. Our investigation on the annotation quality by three human evaluators
demonstrated the superiority of the MAAD-Face annotations over existing
databases. Additionally, we make use of the large amount of high-quality
annotations from MAAD-Face to study the viability of soft-biometrics for
recognition, providing insights about which attributes support genuine and
imposter decisions. The MAAD-Face annotations dataset is publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. However,
satisfying performance highly depends on a large number of pixel-level
annotations. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised
segmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a
much larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the
limited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the
training data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A
preferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information
while not losing self-awareness. Therefore, we propose to maintain the
context-aware consistency between features of the same identity but with
different contexts, making the representations robust to the varying
environments. Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss)
to accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the
feature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart. In addition,
to avoid the false-negative samples and filter the uncertain positive samples,
we put forward two sampling strategies. Extensive experiments show that our
simple yet effective method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin and also generalizes well with extra image-level annotations.</span>

political discussion and decision-making for many years. Shallow clouds play a
significant role in understanding the Earth&#x27;s climate, but they are challenging
to interpret and represent in a climate model. By classifying these cloud
structures, there is a better possibility of understanding the physical
structures of the clouds, which would improve the climate model generation,
resulting in a better prediction of climate change or forecasting weather
update. Clouds organise in many forms, which makes it challenging to build
traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. In this paper,
classification of cloud organization patterns was performed using a new
scaled-up version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named as EfficientNet
as the encoder and UNet as decoder where they worked as feature extractor and
reconstructor of fine grained feature map and was used as a classifier, which
will help experts to understand how clouds will shape the future climate. By
using a segmentation model in a classification task, it was shown that with a
good encoder alongside UNet, it is possible to obtain good performance from
this dataset. Dice coefficient has been used for the final evaluation metric,

                                        <span>Accelerating multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a new and
effective solution for fast MR imaging, providing superior performance in
restoring the target modality from its undersampled counterpart with guidance
from an auxiliary modality. However, existing works simply introduce the
auxiliary modality as prior information, lacking in-depth investigations on the
potential mechanisms for fusing two modalities. Further, they usually rely on
the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local information and
prevent them from fully capturing the long-distance dependencies of global
knowledge. To this end, we propose a multi-modal transformer (MTrans), which is
capable of transferring multi-scale features from the target modality to the
auxiliary modality, for accelerated MR imaging. By restructuring the
transformer architecture, our MTrans gains a powerful ability to capture deep
multi-modal information. More specifically, the target modality and the
auxiliary modality are first split into two branches and then fused using a
multi-modal transformer module. This module is based on an improved multi-head
attention mechanism, named the cross attention module, which absorbs features
from the auxiliary modality that contribute to the target modality. Our
framework provides two appealing benefits: (i) MTrans is the first attempt at
using improved transformers for multi-modal MR imaging, affording more global
information compared with CNN-based methods. (ii) A new cross attention module
is proposed to exploit the useful information in each branch at different
scales. It affords both distinct structural information and subtle pixel-level
information, which supplement the target modality effectively.</span>

                                        <span>Increasing demands for understanding the internal behavior of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have led to remarkable improvements in explanation
methods. Particularly, several class activation mapping (CAM) based methods,
which generate visual explanation maps by a linear combination of activation
maps from CNNs, have been proposed. However, the majority of the methods lack a
clear theoretical basis on how they assign the coefficients of the linear
combination. In this paper, we revisit the intrinsic linearity of CAM with
respect to the activation maps; we construct an explanation model of CNN as a
linear function of binary variables that denote the existence of the
corresponding activation maps. With this approach, the explanation model can be
determined by additive feature attribution methods in an analytic manner. We
then demonstrate the adequacy of SHAP values, which is a unique solution for
the explanation model with a set of desirable properties, as the coefficients
of CAM. Since the exact SHAP values are unattainable, we introduce an efficient
approximation method, LIFT-CAM, based on DeepLIFT. Our proposed LIFT-CAM can
estimate the SHAP values of the activation maps with high speed and accuracy.
Furthermore, it greatly outperforms other previous CAM-based methods in both
qualitative and quantitative aspects.</span>

                                        <span>Image-based 3D object modeling refers to the process of converting raw
optical images to 3D digital representations of the objects. Very often, such
models are desired to be dimensionally true, semantically labeled with
photorealistic appearance (reality-based modeling). Laser scanning was deemed
as the standard (and direct) way to obtaining highly accurate 3D measurements
of objects, while one would have to abide the high acquisition cost and its
unavailability on some of the platforms. Nowadays the image-based methods
backboned by the recently developed advanced dense image matching algorithms
and geo-referencing paradigms, are becoming the dominant approaches, due to its
high flexibility, availability and low cost. The largely automated geometric
processing of images in a 3D object reconstruction workflow, from
ordered/unordered raw imagery to textured meshes, is becoming a critical part
of the reality-based 3D modeling. This article summarizes the overall geometric
processing workflow, with focuses on introducing the state-of-the-art methods
of three major components of geometric processing: 1) geo-referencing; 2) Image
dense matching 3) texture mapping. Finally, we will draw conclusions and share
our outlooks of the topics discussed in this article.</span>

                                        <span>Instance segmentation of images is an important tool for automated scene
understanding. Neural networks are usually trained to optimize their overall
performance in terms of accuracy. Meanwhile, in applications such as automated
driving, an overlooked pedestrian seems more harmful than a falsely detected
one. In this work, we present a false negative detection method for image
sequences based on inconsistencies in time series of tracked instances given
the availability of image sequences in online applications. As the number of
instances can be greatly increased by this algorithm, we apply a false positive
pruning using uncertainty estimates aggregated over instances. To this end,
instance-wise metrics are constructed which characterize uncertainty and
geometry of a given instance or are predicated on depth estimation. The
proposed method serves as a post-processing step applicable to any neural
network that can also be trained on single frames only. In our tests, we obtain
an improved trade-off between false negative and false positive instances by
our fused detection approach in comparison to the use of an ordinary score
value provided by the instance segmentation network during inference.</span>

                                        <span>With recent advances in deep learning, neuroimaging studies increasingly rely
on convolutional networks (ConvNets) to predict diagnosis based on MR images.
To gain a better understanding of how a disease impacts the brain, the studies
visualize the salience maps of the ConvNet highlighting voxels within the brain
majorly contributing to the prediction. However, these salience maps are
generally confounded, i.e., some salient regions are more predictive of
confounding variables (such as age) than the diagnosis. To avoid such
misinterpretation, we propose in this paper an approach that aims to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps that only highlight voxels predictive of the
diagnosis. The approach incorporates univariate statistical tests to identify
confounding effects within the intermediate features learned by ConvNet. The
influence from the subset of confounded features is then removed by a novel
partial back-propagation procedure. We use this two-step approach to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps extracted from synthetic and two real datasets.
These experiments reveal the potential of our visualization in producing
unbiased model-interpretation.</span>

activities for decades. However, most of traditional decoders require
well-founded barcode under a relatively standard condition. While wilder
conditioned barcodes such as underexposed, occluded, blurry, wrinkled and
rotated are commonly captured in reality, those traditional decoders show
weakness of recognizing. Several works attempted to solve those challenging
barcodes, but many limitations still exist. This work aims to solve the
decoding problem using deep convolutional neural network with the possibility
of running on portable devices. Firstly, we proposed a special modification of
inference based on the feature of having checksum and test-time augmentation,
named as Smart Inference (SI) in prediction phase of a trained model. SI
considerably boosts accuracy and reduces the false prediction for trained
models. Secondly, we have created a large practical evaluation dataset of real
captured 1D barcode under various challenging conditions to test our methods
vigorously, which is publicly available for other researchers. The experiments&#x27;
results demonstrated the SI effectiveness with the highest accuracy of 95.85%
which outperformed many existing decoders on the evaluation set. Finally, we
successfully minimized the best model by knowledge distillation to a shallow
model which is shown to have high accuracy (90.85%) with good inference speed
of 34.2 ms per image on a real edge device.</span>

desired visual multimedia. In particular, image generation using deep learning
has been extensively studied across diverse fields. In comparison, video
generation, especially on conditional inputs, remains a challenging and less
explored area. To narrow this gap, we aim to train our model to produce a video
corresponding to a given text description. We propose a novel training
framework, Text-to-Image-to-Video Generative Adversarial Network (TiVGAN),
which evolves frame-by-frame and finally produces a full-length video. In the
first phase, we focus on creating a high-quality single video frame while
learning the relationship between the text and an image. As the steps proceed,
our model is trained gradually on more number of consecutive frames.This
step-by-step learning process helps stabilize the training and enables the
creation of high-resolution video based on conditional text descriptions.

                                        <span>Discriminating small moving objects within complex visual environments is a
significant challenge for autonomous micro robots that are generally limited in
computational power. By exploiting their highly evolved visual systems, flying
insects can effectively detect mates and track prey during rapid pursuits, even
though the small targets equate to only a few pixels in their visual field. The
high degree of sensitivity to small target movement is supported by a class of
specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Existing
STMD-based computational models normally comprise four sequentially arranged
neural layers interconnected via feedforward loops to extract information on
small target motion from raw visual inputs. However, feedback, another
important regulatory circuit for motion perception, has not been investigated
in the STMD pathway and its functional roles for small target motion detection
are not clear. In this paper, we propose an STMD-based neural network with
feedback connection (Feedback STMD), where the network output is temporally
delayed, then fed back to the lower layers to mediate neural responses. We
compare the properties of the model with and without the time-delay feedback
loop, and find it shows preference for high-velocity objects. Extensive
experiments suggest that the Feedback STMD achieves superior detection
performance for fast-moving small targets, while significantly suppressing
background false positive movements which display lower velocities. The
proposed feedback model provides an effective solution in robotic visual
systems for detecting fast-moving small targets that are always salient and
potentially threatening.</span>

                                        <span>Monocular depth prediction plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene
geometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in terms of
evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect
the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance
of the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a
loss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, virtual normal
directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D
space, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth
estimation. Significantly, the virtual normal loss can not only improve the
performance of learning metric depth, but also disentangle the scale
information and enrich the model with better shape information. Therefore, when
not having access to absolute metric depth training data, we can use virtual
normal to learn a robust affine-invariant depth generated on diverse scenes. In
experiments, We show state-of-the-art results of learning metric depth on NYU
Depth-V2 and KITTI. From the high-quality predicted depth, we are now able to
recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface
normal directly, eliminating the necessity of relying on additional models as
was previously done. To demonstrate the excellent generalizability of learning
affine-invariant depth on diverse data with the virtual normal loss, we
construct a large-scale and diverse dataset for training affine-invariant
depth, termed Diverse Scene Depth dataset (DiverseDepth), and test on five
datasets with the zero-shot test setting. Code is available at:

                                        <span>Automotive traffic scenes are complex due to the variety of possible
scenarios, objects, and weather conditions that need to be handled. In contrast
to more constrained environments, such as automated underground trains,
automotive perception systems cannot be tailored to a narrow field of specific
tasks but must handle an ever-changing environment with unforeseen events. As
currently no single sensor is able to reliably perceive all relevant activity
in the surroundings, sensor data fusion is applied to perceive as much
information as possible. Data fusion of different sensors and sensor modalities
on a low abstraction level enables the compensation of sensor weaknesses and
misdetections among the sensors before the information-rich sensor data are
compressed and thereby information is lost after a sensor-individual object
detection. This paper develops a low-level sensor fusion network for 3D object
detection, which fuses lidar, camera, and radar data. The fusion network is
trained and evaluated on the nuScenes data set. On the test set, fusion of
radar data increases the resulting AP (Average Precision) detection score by
about 5.1% in comparison to the baseline lidar network. The radar sensor fusion
proves especially beneficial in inclement conditions such as rain and night
scenes. Fusing additional camera data contributes positively only in
conjunction with the radar fusion, which shows that interdependencies of the
sensors are important for the detection result. Additionally, the paper
proposes a novel loss to handle the discontinuity of a simple yaw
representation for object detection. Our updated loss increases the detection
and orientation estimation performance for all sensor input configurations. The
code for this research has been made available on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>In large technology companies, the requirements for managing and organizing
technical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant
decision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a
higher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document
classification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for
classification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel
multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document
classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to
train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training
process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document
database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the
hierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that
the trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than
those using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.
The trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical
documents with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge
management in large technology companies and organizations.</span>

                                        <span>The recent vision transformer(i.e.for image classification) learns non-local
attentive interaction of different patch tokens. However, prior arts miss
learning the cross-scale dependencies of different pixels, the semantic
correspondence of different labels, and the consistency of the feature
representations and semantic embeddings, which are critical for biomedical
segmentation. In this paper, we tackle the above issues by proposing a unified
transformer network, termed Multi-Compound Transformer (MCTrans), which
incorporates rich feature learning and semantic structure mining into a unified
framework. Specifically, MCTrans embeds the multi-scale convolutional features
as a sequence of tokens and performs intra- and inter-scale self-attention,
rather than single-scale attention in previous works. In addition, a learnable
proxy embedding is also introduced to model semantic relationship and feature
enhancement by using self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. MCTrans
can be easily plugged into a UNet-like network and attains a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in biomedical image segmentation
in six standard benchmarks. For example, MCTrans outperforms UNet by 3.64%,
3.71%, 4.34%, 2.8%, 1.88%, 1.57% in Pannuke, CVC-Clinic, CVC-Colon, Etis,
Kavirs, ISIC2018 dataset, respectively. Code is available at

                                        <span>The past few years have witnessed great progress in the domain of face
recognition thanks to advances in deep learning. However, cross pose face
recognition remains a significant challenge. It is difficult for many deep
learning algorithms to narrow the performance gap caused by pose variations;
the main reasons for this relate to the intra-class discrepancy between face
images in different poses and the pose imbalances of training datasets.
Learning pose-robust features by traversing to the feature space of frontal
faces provides an effective and cheap way to alleviate this problem. In this
paper, we present a method for progressively transforming profile face
representations to the canonical pose with an attentive pair-wise loss.
Firstly, to reduce the difficulty of directly transforming the profile face
features into a frontal pose, we propose to learn the feature residual between
the source pose and its nearby pose in a block-byblock fashion, and thus
traversing to the feature space of a smaller pose by adding the learned
residual. Secondly, we propose an attentive pair-wise loss to guide the feature
transformation progressing in the most effective direction. Finally, our
proposed progressive module and attentive pair-wise loss are light-weight and
easy to implement, adding only about 7:5% extra parameters. Evaluations on the
CFP and CPLFW datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Code

                                        <span>Data augmentation is a powerful technique for improving the performance of
the few-shot classification task. It generates more samples as supplements, and
then this task can be transformed into a common supervised learning issue for
solution. However, most mainstream data augmentation based approaches only
consider the single modality information, which leads to the low diversity and
quality of generated features. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal
data augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder
(DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue. DCVAE conducts feature
synthesis via pairing two Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs) with the
same seed but different modality conditions in a dizygotic symbiosis manner.
Subsequently, the generated features of two CVAEs are adaptively combined to
yield the final feature, which can be converted back into its paired conditions
while ensuring these conditions are consistent with the original conditions not
only in representation but also in function. DCVAE essentially provides a new
idea of data augmentation in various multi-modal scenarios by exploiting the
complement of different modality prior information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate our work achieves state-of-the-art performances on
miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets, and is able to work well in the
partial modality absence case.</span>

contrastively learned representations are more robust against the catastrophic

                                        <span>Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a destructive joint disease identified by joint
stiffness, pain, and functional disability concerning millions of lives across
the globe. It is generally assessed by evaluating physical symptoms, medical
history, and other joint screening tests like radiographs, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Unfortunately, the
conventional methods are very subjective, which forms a barrier in detecting
the disease progression at an early stage. This paper presents a deep
learning-based framework, namely OsteoHRNet, that automatically assesses the
Knee OA severity in terms of Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade classification
from X-rays. As a primary novelty, the proposed approach is built upon one of
the most recent deep models, called the High-Resolution Network (HRNet), to
capture the multi-scale features of knee X-rays. In addition, we have also
incorporated an attention mechanism to filter out the counterproductive
features and boost the performance further. Our proposed model has achieved the
best multiclass accuracy of 71.74% and MAE of 0.311 on the baseline cohort of
the OAI dataset, which is a remarkable gain over the existing best-published
works. We have also employed the Gradient-based Class Activation Maps

picture by sharpening the output. Instead of producing a coarse localization
map that highlights the important predictive regions in the image, the proposed
method outputs the specific shape that most contributes to the model output.
Thus, the proposed method improves the accuracy of saliency maps. The effect
has been achieved by the gradual propagation of the crude map obtained in the
deep layer through all preceding layers with respect to their activations. In
validation tests conducted on a selected set of images, the faithfulness,
interpretability, and applicability of the method are evaluated. The proposed
technique significantly improves the localization detection of the neural
networks attention at low additional computational costs. Furthermore, the
proposed method is applicable to a variety deep neural network models. The code

                                        <span>Interpretability is a critical factor in applying complex deep learning
models to advance the understanding of brain disorders in neuroimaging studies.
To interpret the decision process of a trained classifier, existing techniques
typically rely on saliency maps to quantify the voxel-wise or feature-level
importance for classification through partial derivatives. Despite providing
some level of localization, these maps are not human-understandable from the
neuroscience perspective as they do not inform the specific meaning of the
alteration linked to the brain disorder. Inspired by the image-to-image
translation scheme, we propose to train simulator networks that can warp a
given image to inject or remove patterns of the disease. These networks are
trained such that the classifier produces consistently increased or decreased
prediction logits for the simulated images. Moreover, we propose to couple all
the simulators into a unified model based on conditional convolution. We
applied our approach to interpreting classifiers trained on a synthetic dataset
and two neuroimaging datasets to visualize the effect of the Alzheimer&#x27;s
disease and alcohol use disorder. Compared to the saliency maps generated by
baseline approaches, our simulations and visualizations based on the Jacobian
determinants of the warping field reveal meaningful and understandable patterns
related to the diseases.</span>

                                        <span>Text spotting in natural scene images is of great importance for many image
understanding tasks. It includes two sub-tasks: text detection and recognition.
In this work, we propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and
recognizes text with a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes
such as image cropping and feature re-calculation, word separation, and
character grouping.

In contrast to existing approaches that consider text detection and
recognition as two distinct tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed
framework settles these two tasks concurrently. The whole framework can be
trained end-to-end and is able to handle text of arbitrary shapes. The
convolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection
and recognition modules. Through multi-task training, the learned features
become more discriminate and improve the overall performance. By employing the
$2$D attention model in word recognition, the irregularity of text can be
robustly addressed. It provides the spatial location for each character, which
not only helps local feature extraction in word recognition, but also indicates
an orientation angle to refine text localization. Our proposed method has
achieved state-of-the-art performance on several standard text spotting
benchmarks, including both regular and irregular ones.</span>

capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode
the location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,
which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,
for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the
position information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly
embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of
deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the
segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate
information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the
consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation
networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related
features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments
on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation
and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of
segmentation networks.</span>

detected objects in an observed scene. The proposed approach modifies the
recently proposed Convolutional Support Estimator Networks (CSENs). CSENs are
designed to compute a direct mapping for the Support Estimation (SE) task in a
representation-based classification problem. We further propose and demonstrate
that representation-based methods (sparse or collaborative representation) can
be used in well-designed regression problems. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first representation-based method proposed for performing a
regression task by utilizing the modified CSENs; and hence, we name this novel
approach as Representation-based Regression (RbR). The initial version of CSENs
has a proxy mapping stage (i.e., a coarse estimation for the support set) that
is required for the input. In this study, we improve the CSEN model by
proposing Compressive Learning CSEN (CL-CSEN) that has the ability to jointly
optimize the so-called proxy mapping stage along with convolutional layers. The
experimental evaluations using the KITTI 3D Object Detection distance
estimation dataset show that the proposed method can achieve a significantly
improved distance estimation performance over all competing methods. Finally,
the software implementations of the methods are publicly shared at

                                        <span>Background: Transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsies of the prostate
is a routine procedure to establish a prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the
10-12 prostate core biopsies only sample a relatively small volume of the
prostate, and tumour lesions in regions between biopsy cores can be missed,
leading to a well-known low sensitivity to detect clinically relevant cancer.
As a proof-of-principle, we developed and validated a deep convolutional neural
network model to distinguish between morphological patterns in benign prostate
biopsy whole slide images from men with and without established cancer.
Methods: This study included 14,354 hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide
images from benign prostate biopsies from 1,508 men in two groups: men without
an established prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and men with at least one core
biopsy diagnosed with PCa. 80% of the participants were assigned as training
data and used for model optimization (1,211 men), and the remaining 20% (297
men) as a held-out test set used to evaluate model performance. An ensemble of
10 deep convolutional neural network models was optimized for classification of
biopsies from men with and without established cancer. Hyperparameter
optimization and model selection was performed by cross-validation in the
training data . Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC) was estimated as 0.727 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.708-0.745) on biopsy
level and 0.738 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.682 - 0.796) on man level. At a
specificity of 0.9 the model had an estimated sensitivity of 0.348. Conclusion:
The developed model has the ability to detect men with risk of missed PCa due
to under-sampling of the prostate. The proposed model has the potential to
reduce the number of false negative cases in routine systematic prostate
biopsies and to indicate men who could benefit from MRI-guided re-biopsy.</span>

                                        <span>Wide field small aperture telescopes (WFSATs) are mainly used to obtain
scientific information of point--like and streak--like celestial objects.
However, qualities of images obtained by WFSATs are seriously affected by the
background noise and variable point spread functions. Developing high speed and
high efficiency data processing method is of great importance for further
scientific research. In recent years, deep neural networks have been proposed
for detection and classification of celestial objects and have shown better
performance than classical methods. In this paper, we further extend abilities
of the deep neural network based astronomical target detection framework to
make it suitable for photometry and astrometry. We add new branches into the
deep neural network to obtain types, magnitudes and positions of different
celestial objects at the same time. Tested with simulated data, we find that
our neural network has better performance in photometry than classical methods.
Because photometry and astrometry are regression algorithms, which would obtain
high accuracy measurements instead of rough classification results, the
accuracy of photometry and astrometry results would be affected by different
observation conditions. To solve this problem, we further propose to use
reference stars to train our deep neural network with transfer learning
strategy when observation conditions change. The photometry framework proposed
in this paper could be used as an end--to--end quick data processing framework
for WFSATs, which can further increase response speed and scientific outputs of
WFSATs.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new perspective on video understanding by casting the video
recognition problem as an image recognition task. We show that an image
classifier alone can suffice for video understanding without temporal modeling.
Our approach is simple and universal. It composes input frames into a super
image to train an image classifier to fulfill the task of action recognition,
in exactly the same way as classifying an image. We prove the viability of such
an idea by demonstrating strong and promising performance on four public
datasets including Kinetics400, Something-to-something (V2), MiT and Jester,
using a recently developed vision transformer. We also experiment with the
prevalent ResNet image classifiers in computer vision to further validate our
idea. The results on Kinetics400 are comparable to some of the best-performed
CNN approaches based on spatio-temporal modeling. our code and models will be
made available at https://github.com/IBM/sifar-pytorch.</span>

                                        <span>Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role
in the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for
3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive
iso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial
data structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to
facilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive
subdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we
devise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex
decomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a
shape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of
planes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network
weights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.
The generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited
to represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net
is competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer
primitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more
generic decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as
well as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders. Code is
available at https://github.com/czq142857/BSP-NET-original.</span>

                                        <span>Perceiving and manipulating 3D articulated objects (e.g., cabinets, doors) in
human environments is an important yet challenging task for future
home-assistant robots. The space of 3D articulated objects is exceptionally
rich in their myriad semantic categories, diverse shape geometry, and
complicated part functionality. Previous works mostly abstract kinematic
structure with estimated joint parameters and part poses as the visual
representations for manipulating 3D articulated objects. In this paper, we
propose object-centric actionable visual priors as a novel
perception-interaction handshaking point that the perception system outputs
more actionable guidance than kinematic structure estimation, by predicting
dense geometry-aware, interaction-aware, and task-aware visual action
affordance and trajectory proposals. We design an interaction-for-perception
framework VAT-Mart to learn such actionable visual representations by
simultaneously training a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy
exploring diverse interaction trajectories and a perception module summarizing
and generalizing the explored knowledge for pointwise predictions among diverse
shapes. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the
large-scale PartNet-Mobility dataset in SAPIEN environment and show promising
generalization capabilities to novel test shapes, unseen object categories, and
real-world data. Project page: https://hyperplane-lab.github.io/vat-mart</span>

related videos generated online are increasing at an unprecedentedly fast pace.
To automate sports video editing/highlight generation process, a key task is to
precisely recognize and locate the events in the long untrimmed videos. In this
tech report, we present a two-stage paradigm to detect what and when events
happen in soccer broadcast videos. Specifically, we fine-tune multiple action
recognition models on soccer data to extract high-level semantic features, and
design a transformer based temporal detection module to locate the target
events. This approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance in both two
tasks, i.e., action spotting and replay grounding, in the SoccerNet-v2
Challenge, under CVPR 2021 ActivityNet workshop. Our soccer embedding features
are released at https://github.com/baidu-research/vidpress-sports. By sharing
these features with the broader community, we hope to accelerate the research

abilities of autonomous agents working in the real-world. Yet, solutions so far
have been computationally intensive, with the fastest algorithms running for
more than half a second per video snippet on powerful GPUs. We propose a novel
idea on video architecture learning - Tiny Video Networks - which automatically
designs highly efficient models for video understanding. The tiny video models
run with competitive performance for as low as 37 milliseconds per video on a

                                        <span>Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a 3D imaging technique that enables the
systemic study of shape, abundance, and distribution of macromolecular
structures in single cells in near-atomic resolution. However, the systematic
and efficient $\textit{de novo}$ recognition and recovery of macromolecular
structures captured by Cryo-ET are very challenging due to the structural
complexity and imaging limits. Even macromolecules with identical structures
have various appearances due to different orientations and imaging limits, such
as noise and the missing wedge effect. Explicitly disentangling the semantic
features of macromolecules is crucial for performing several downstream
analyses on the macromolecules. This paper has addressed the problem by
proposing a 3D Spatial Variational Autoencoder that explicitly disentangle the
structure, orientation, and shift of macromolecules. Extensive experiments on
both synthesized and real cryo-ET datasets and cross-domain evaluations
demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents Kimera-Multi, the first multi-robot system that (i) is
robust and capable of identifying and rejecting incorrect inter and intra-robot
loop closures resulting from perceptual aliasing, (ii) is fully distributed and
only relies on local (peer-to-peer) communication to achieve distributed
localization and mapping, and (iii) builds a globally consistent
metric-semantic 3D mesh model of the environment in real-time, where faces of
the mesh are annotated with semantic labels. Kimera-Multi is implemented by a
team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local
trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is
available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose
graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated
non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve
their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while
being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory
estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques.

We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking
datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both
real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800
meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the
state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation
errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed,
(iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces
accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for
standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory
estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).</span>

expansion learning for image classification, which aims at improving the
supervision-stimulation frequency for the samples of the confusing classes.
Class-based expansion learning takes a bottom-up growing strategy in a
class-based expansion optimization fashion, which pays more attention to the
quality of learning the fine-grained classification boundaries for the
preferentially selected classes. Besides, we develop a class confusion
criterion to select the confusing class preferentially for training. In this
way, the classification boundaries of the confusing classes are frequently
stimulated, resulting in a fine-grained form. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on several benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Image matting is an ill-posed problem that aims to estimate the opacity of
foreground pixels in an image. However, most existing deep learning-based
methods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these
algorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of
exploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and
undetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose
information in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal
result. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced
Information Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently
model the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of
layer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation
mechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the
DGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the
prior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the
opacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other
hand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information
Aggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent
layer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale
Refinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at
the refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed
PIIAMatting performs favourably against state-of-the-art image matting methods
on the Alphamatting.com, Composition-1K and Distinctions-646 dataset.</span>

presented, attempting to reconstruct a face from deep templates. Although some
of these approaches work in a black-box setup using only face embeddings,
usually, on the end-user side, only similarity scores are provided. Therefore,
these algorithms are inapplicable in such scenarios. We propose a novel

                                        <span>Powerful deep learning algorithms open an opportunity for solving non-image
Machine Learning (ML) problems by transforming these problems to into the image
recognition problems. The CPC-R algorithm presented in this chapter converts
non-image data into images by visualizing non-image data. Then deep learning
CNN algorithms solve the learning problems on these images. The design of the
CPC-R algorithm allows preserving all high-dimensional information in 2-D
images. The use of pair values mapping instead of single value mapping used in
the alternative approaches allows encoding each n-D point with 2 times fewer
visual elements. The attributes of an n-D point are divided into pairs of its
values and each pair is visualized as 2-D points in the same 2-D Cartesian
coordinates. Next, grey scale or color intensity values are assigned to each
pair to encode the order of pairs. This is resulted in the heatmap image. The
computational experiments with CPC-R are conducted for different CNN
architectures, and methods to optimize the CPC-R images showing that the
combined CPC-R and deep learning CNN algorithms are able to solve non-image ML
problems reaching high accuracy on the benchmark datasets. This chapter expands
our prior work by adding more experiments to test accuracy of classification,
exploring saliency and informativeness of discovered features to test their
interpretability, and generalizing the approach.</span>

form thanks to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Recent studies show that
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform very well to identify skin lesions
from the image but, there is not much work for Lyme disease prediction from EM
lesion images. The main objective of this study is to extensively analyze the
effectiveness of CNNs for diagnosing Lyme disease from images and to find out
the best CNN architecture for the purpose. There is no publicly available EM

                                        <span>Content-independent watermarks and block-wise independency can be considered
as vulnerabilities in semi-fragile watermarking methods. In this paper to
achieve the objectives of semi-fragile watermarking techniques, a method is
proposed to not have the mentioned shortcomings. In the proposed method, the
watermark is generated by relying on image content and a key. Furthermore, the
embedding scheme causes the watermarked blocks to become dependent on each
other, using a key. In the embedding phase, the image is partitioned into
non-overlapping blocks. In order to detect and separate the different types of
attacks more precisely, the proposed method embeds three copies of each
watermark bit into LWT coefficients of each 4x4 block. In the authentication
phase, by voting between the extracted bits the error maps are created; these
maps indicate image authenticity and reveal the modified regions. Also, in
order to automate the authentication, the images are classified into four
categories using seven features. Classification accuracy in the experiments is
97.97 percent. It is noted that our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method is robust against JPEG compression and is competitive with a
state-of-the-art semi-fragile watermarking method, in terms of robustness and
semi-fragility.</span>

classes, the network learns new concepts but gradually forgets the knowledge of
old training. In some real-life applications, we may be interested in learning
new classes without forgetting the capability of previous experience. Such
learning without forgetting problem is often investigated using 2D image
recognition tasks. In this paper, considering the growth of depth camera
technology, we address the same problem for the 3D point cloud object data.
This problem becomes more challenging in the 3D domain than 2D because of the
unavailability of large datasets and powerful pretrained backbone models. We
investigate knowledge distillation techniques on 3D data to reduce catastrophic
forgetting of the previous training. Moreover, we improve the distillation
process by using semantic word vectors of object classes. We observe that
exploring the interrelation of old and new knowledge during training helps to
learn new concepts without forgetting old ones. Experimenting on three 3D point
cloud recognition backbones (PointNet, DGCNN, and PointConv) and synthetic
(ModelNet40, ModelNet10) and real scanned (ScanObjectNN) datasets, we establish
new baseline results on learning without forgetting for 3D data. This research
will instigate many future works in this area.</span>

                                        <span>Many deep learning based methods are designed to remove non-uniform
(spatially variant) motion blur caused by object motion and camera shake
without knowing the blur kernel. Some methods directly output the latent sharp
image in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (\eg
multi-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp
image. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The
computational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is
applied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform
blur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open
problem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of
multiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to
deblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules
implicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the
same layer to handle movements of different magnitude. To improve the training,
we also propose a reblurring network to map the deblurred output back to the
blurred input, which constrains the solution space. Our experimental results
show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
benchmark datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low
power magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power
fluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the
fluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and
effectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more
prone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise
measurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.
Moreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower
but still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a
shielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,
it can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents
algorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.
To improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms
that employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired
and well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support
vector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network
architecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based
method. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is
generated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by
comparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of
the machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly
emphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural
network can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding
receiver operating characteristic curves.</span>

Although both accuracy and speed are required in real-world applications,
recent tracking methods based on deep learning have focused on accuracy and
require substantial running time. This study aims to improve running speed by
performing human detection at a certain frame interval because it accounts for
most of the running time. The question is how to maintain accuracy while
skipping human detection. In this paper, we propose a method that complements
the detection results with optical flow, based on the fact that someone&#x27;s
appearance does not change much between adjacent frames. To maintain the
tracking accuracy, we introduce robust interest point selection within human
regions and a tracking termination metric calculated by the distribution of the
interest points. On the MOT20 dataset in the MOTChallenge, the proposed
SDOF-Tracker achieved the best performance in terms of the total running speed

(COPSE) from a single depth image, without external pose-annotated real-world
training data. While previous works exploit visual cues in RGB(D) images, our
method makes inferences based on the rich geometric information of the object
in the depth channel alone. Essentially, our framework explores such geometric
information by learning the unified 3D Orientation-Consistent Representations
(3D-OCR) module, and further enforced by the property of Geometry-constrained
Reflection Symmetry (GeoReS) module. The magnitude information of object size
and the center point is finally estimated by Mirror-Paired Dimensional
Estimation (MPDE) module. Extensive experiments on the category-level NOCS
benchmark demonstrate that our framework competes with state-of-the-art
approaches that require labeled real-world images. We also deploy our approach
to a physical Baxter robot to perform manipulation tasks on unseen but
category-known instances, and the results further validate the efficacy of our
proposed model. Our videos are available in the supplementary material.</span>

                                        <span>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is an indispensable and widely used module in face
recognition systems. Although high accuracy has been achieved, a FAS system
will never be perfect due to the non-stationary applied environments and the
potential emergence of new types of presentation attacks in real-world
applications. In practice, given a handful of labeled samples from a new
deployment scenario (target domain) and abundant labeled face images in the
existing source domain, the FAS system is expected to perform well in the new
scenario without sacrificing the performance on the original domain. To this
end, we identify and address a more practical problem: Few-Shot Domain
Expansion for Face Anti-Spoofing (FSDE-FAS). This problem is challenging since
with insufficient target domain training samples, the model may suffer from
both overfitting to the target domain and catastrophic forgetting of the source
domain. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Style transfer-based
Augmentation for Semantic Alignment (SASA) framework. We propose to augment the
target data by generating auxiliary samples based on photorealistic style
transfer. With the assistant of the augmented data, we further propose a
carefully designed mechanism to align different domains from both
instance-level and distribution-level, and then stabilize the performance on
the source domain with a less-forgetting constraint. Two benchmarks are
proposed to simulate the FSDE-FAS scenarios, and the experimental results show
that the proposed SASA method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a novel method on refining cross-person gaze prediction task with
eye/face images only by explicitly modelling the person-specific differences.
Specifically, we first assume that we can obtain some initial gaze prediction
results with existing method, which we refer to as InitNet, and then introduce
three modules, the Validity Module (VM), Self-Calibration (SC) and
Person-specific Transform (PT)) Module. By predicting the reliability of
current eye/face images, our VM is able to identify invalid samples, e.g. eye
blinking images, and reduce their effects in our modelling process. Our SC and
PT module then learn to compensate for the differences on valid samples only.
The former models the translation offsets by bridging the gap between initial
predictions and dataset-wise distribution. And the later learns more general
person-specific transformation by incorporating the information from existing
initial predictions of the same person. We validate our ideas on three publicly
available datasets, EVE, XGaze and MPIIGaze and demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms the SOTA methods significantly on all of them, e.g.
respectively 21.7%, 36.0% and 32.9% relative performance improvements. We won
the GAZE 2021 Competition on the EVE dataset. Our code can be found here

                                        <span>Recently, transformer has achieved remarkable performance on a variety of
computer vision applications. Compared with mainstream convolutional neural
networks, vision transformers are often of sophisticated architectures for
extracting powerful feature representations, which are more difficult to be
developed on mobile devices. In this paper, we present an effective
post-training quantization algorithm for reducing the memory storage and
computational costs of vision transformers. Basically, the quantization task
can be regarded as finding the optimal low-bit quantization intervals for
weights and inputs, respectively. To preserve the functionality of the
attention mechanism, we introduce a ranking loss into the conventional
quantization objective that aims to keep the relative order of the
self-attention results after quantization. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze the
relationship between quantization loss of different layers and the feature
diversity, and explore a mixed-precision quantization scheme by exploiting the
nuclear norm of each attention map and output feature. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is verified on several benchmark models and datasets, which
outperforms the state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithms. For
instance, we can obtain an 81.29\% top-1 accuracy using DeiT-B model on
ImageNet dataset with about 8-bit quantization.</span>

                                        <span>In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via
computer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability
that contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can
significantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in
the ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be
described by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that
can be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged
objects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging
measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this
task has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To
establish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that
augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN
could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN
architectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized
medical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN
training strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or
multi-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive
Growing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the
proposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by
use of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging
system. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging
data are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.</span>

                                        <span>Ultrasound scanning is essential in several medical diagnostic and
therapeutic applications. It is used to visualize and analyze anatomical
features and structures that influence treatment plans. However, it is both
labor intensive, and its effectiveness is operator dependent. Real-time
accurate and robust automatic detection and tracking of anatomical structures
while scanning would significantly impact diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
to be consistent and efficient. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework to automatically detect and track a specific anatomical target
structure in ultrasound scans. Our framework is designed to be accurate and
robust across subjects and imaging devices, to operate in real-time, and to not
require a large training set. It maintains a localization precision and recall
higher than 90% when trained on training sets that are as small as 20% in size
of the original training set. The framework backbone is a weakly trained
segmentation neural network based on U-Net. We tested the framework on two
different ultrasound datasets with the aim to detect and track the Vagus nerve,
where it outperformed current state-of-the-art real-time object detection
networks.</span>

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)
action recognition. However, TAL poses a unique set of challenges. In this
paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the

consistently improve performance for state of the art video-only TAL

                                        <span>Domain shift is a major challenge for object detectors to generalize well to
real world applications. Emerging techniques of domain adaptation for two-stage
detectors help to tackle this problem. However, two-stage detectors are not the
first choice for industrial applications due to its long time consumption. In
this paper, a novel Domain Adaptive YOLO (DA-YOLO) is proposed to improve
cross-domain performance for one-stage detectors. Image level features
alignment is used to strictly match for local features like texture, and
loosely match for global features like illumination. Multi-scale instance level
features alignment is presented to reduce instance domain shift effectively ,
such as variations in object appearance and viewpoint. A consensus
regularization to these domain classifiers is employed to help the network
generate domain-invariant detections. We evaluate our proposed method on
popular datasets like Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K and etc.. The results
demonstrate significant improvement when tested under different cross-domain
scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>During the last decade or so, there has been an insurgence in the deep
learning community to solve health-related issues, particularly breast cancer.
Following the Camelyon-16 challenge in 2016, several researchers have dedicated
their time to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help radiologists
and other clinicians diagnose breast cancer. In particular, there has been an
emphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage
breast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into
this subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that
has proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer
correctly.

We found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an
explanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight
those pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then
chose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen,
using the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later
improved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically
comparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one
converged earlier in the experiments.

Following the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and
regions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is
represented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to
the diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final
classification. The most significant advantage of this algorithm is that it
performs exceptionally well with the Resnet-50 patch classifier architecture.</span>

from generating overconfident output distributions. For each training sample
the LS strategy smooths the one-hot encoded training signal by distributing its
distribution mass over the non-ground truth classes. We extend this technique
by considering example pairs, coined PLS. PLS first creates midpoint samples by
averaging random sample pairs and then learns a smoothing distribution during
training for each of these midpoint samples, resulting in midpoints with high
uncertainty labels for training. We empirically show that PLS significantly
outperforms LS, achieving up to 30% of relative classification error reduction.
We also visualize that PLS produces very low winning softmax scores for both in
and out of distribution samples.</span>

                                        <span>The geodatabase (vectorized data) nowadays becomes a rather standard digital
city infrastructure; however, updating geodatabase efficiently and economically
remains a fundamental and practical issue in the geospatial industry. The cost
of building a geodatabase is extremely high and labor intensive, and very often
the maps we use have several months and even years of latency. One solution is
to develop more automated methods for (vectorized) geospatial data generation,
which has been proven a difficult task in the past decades. An alternative
solution is to first detect the differences between the new data and the
existing geospatial data, and then only update the area identified as changes.
The second approach is becoming more favored due to its high practicality and
flexibility. A highly relevant technique is change detection. This article aims
to provide an overview the state-of-the-art change detection methods in the
field of Remote Sensing and Geomatics to support the task of updating
geodatabases. Data used for change detection are highly disparate, we therefore
structure our review intuitively based on the dimension of the data, being 1)
change detection with 2D data; 2) change detection with 3D data. Conclusions
will be drawn based on the reviewed efforts in the field, and we will share our
outlooks of the topic of updating geodatabases.</span>

possible to provide high-quality traffic data for effective transportation
planning, operations, and management. However, deriving reliable traffic
metrics from these camera feeds has been a challenge due to the limitations of
current vehicle detection techniques, as well as the various camera conditions
such as height and resolution. In this work, a quadtree based algorithm is
developed to continuously partition the image extent until only regions with
high detection accuracy are remained. These regions are referred to as the
high-accuracy identification regions (HAIR) in this paper. We demonstrate how
the use of the HAIR can improve the accuracy of traffic density estimates using
images from traffic cameras at different heights and resolutions in Central
Ohio. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm can be used to derive
robust HAIR where vehicle detection accuracy is 41 percent higher than that in
the original image extent. The use of the HAIR also significantly improves the
traffic density estimation with an overall decrease of 49 percent in root mean
squared error.</span>

                                        <span>Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will
likely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform
real-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful
framework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data
distributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such
as covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to
be independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were
introduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data
sources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such
a way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the
prediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing
across data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider
a conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being
dependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying
data-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism
to adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such
an approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods
since it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further
yields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training
instabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in
domain-invariant methods.</span>

raw images or videos) as input, however, practical scenarios may often consist
the situations where part of the visual information becomes inaccessible due to
various reasons e.g., restricted view with fixed camera or intentional vision
block for security concerns. As a step towards the more practical application
scenarios, we introduce a novel task that aims to describe a video using the
natural language dialog between two agents as a supplementary information
source given incomplete visual data. Different from most existing
vision-language tasks where AI systems have full access to images or video
clips, which may reveal sensitive information such as recognizable human faces
or voices, we intentionally limit the visual input for AI systems and seek a
more secure and transparent information medium, i.e., the natural language
dialog, to supplement the missing visual information. Specifically, one of the
intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two semantic segmented frames from the
beginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities
to ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video.
A-BOT, the other agent who has access to the entire video, assists Q-BOT to
accomplish the goal by answering the asked questions. We introduce two
different experimental settings with either a generative (i.e., agents generate
questions and answers freely) or a discriminative (i.e., agents select the
questions and answers from candidates) internal dialog generation process. With
the proposed unified QA-Cooperative networks, we experimentally demonstrate the
knowledge transfer process between the two dialog agents and the effectiveness
of using the natural language dialog as a supplement for incomplete implicit
visions.</span>

sensing data (e.g. images) obtained from atmospheric monitoring missions. The
first issue relates the building new public datasets and benchmarks, which are
hot priority of the remote sensing community. The second issue is the
investigation of deep learning methodologies for atmospheric data
classification based on vast amount of data without annotations and with
localized annotated data provided by sparse observing networks at the surface.
The targeted application is air quality assessment and prediction. Air quality
is defined as the pollution level linked with several atmospheric constituents
such as gases and aerosols. There are dependency relationships between the bad
air quality, caused by air pollution, and the public health. The target
application is the development of a fast prediction model for local and
regional air quality assessment and tracking. The results of mining data will
have significant implication for citizen and decision makers by providing a
fast prediction and reliable air quality monitoring system able to cover the
local and regional scale through intelligent extrapolation of sparse

re-identification (Re-ID) has attracted much attention in recent years, by
additionally exploiting the source set. However, due to the differences on
camera styles, illumination and backgrounds, there exists a large gap between
source domain and target domain, introducing a great challenge on cross-domain
matching. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method named
Dual-stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning (DRDL), which is quite
efficient in learning domain-invariant features. In DRDL, two encoders are
first constructed for id-related and id-unrelated feature extractions, which
are respectively measured by their associated classifiers. Furthermore,
followed by an adversarial learning strategy, both streams reciprocally and
positively effect each other, so that the id-related features and id-unrelated
features are completely disentangled from a given image, allowing the encoder
to be powerful enough to obtain the discriminative but domain-invariant
features. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed method is free from

differences across different sensor makes and models. This paper focuses on the
task of mapping between different sensor raw-RGB color spaces. Prior work
addressed this problem using a pairwise calibration to achieve accurate color
mapping. Although being accurate, this approach is less practical as it
requires: (1) capturing pair of images by both camera devices with a color
calibration object placed in each new scene; (2) accurate image alignment or
manual annotation of the color calibration object. This paper aims to tackle
color mapping in the raw space through a more practical setup. Specifically, we
present a semi-supervised raw-to-raw mapping method trained on a small set of
paired images alongside an unpaired set of images captured by each camera
device. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves better
results compared to other domain adaptation alternatives in addition to the
single-calibration solution. We have generated a new dataset of raw images from
two different smartphone cameras as part of this effort. Our dataset includes
unpaired and paired sets for our semi-supervised training and evaluation.</span>

high-resolution, realistic and high-fidelity face exchange. First of all, in
order to ensure sufficient clarity and authenticity, our key idea is to use an
advanced pretrained high-quality random face image generator, i.e. StyleGAN, as
backbone. Secondly, we design ShapeEditor, a two-step encoder, to make the
swapped face integrate the identity and attribute of the input faces. In the
first step, we extract the identity vector of the source image and the
attribute vector of the target image respectively; in the second step, we map
the concatenation of identity vector and attribute vector into the
$\mathcal{W+}$ potential space. In addition, for learning to map into the
latent space of StyleGAN, we propose a set of self-supervised loss functions
with which the training data do not need to be labeled manually. Extensive
experiments on the test dataset show that the results of our method not only
have a great advantage in clarity and authenticity than other state-of-the-art
methods, but also reflect the sufficient integration of identity and attribute.</span>

                                        <span>Pose transfer of human videos aims to generate a high fidelity video of a
target person imitating actions of a source person. A few studies have made
great progress either through image translation with deep latent features or
neural rendering with explicit 3D features. However, both of them rely on large
amounts of training data to generate realistic results, and the performance
degrades on more accessible internet videos due to insufficient training
frames. In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamic details can be preserved
even trained from short monocular videos. Overall, we propose a neural video
rendering framework coupled with an image-translation-based dynamic details
generation network (D2G-Net), which fully utilizes both the stability of
explicit 3D features and the capacity of learning components. To be specific, a
novel texture representation is presented to encode both the static and
pose-varying appearance characteristics, which is then mapped to the image
space and rendered as a detail-rich frame in the neural rendering stage.
Moreover, we introduce a concise temporal loss in the training stage to
suppress the detail flickering that is made more visible due to high-quality
dynamic details generated by our method. Through extensive comparisons, we
demonstrate that our neural human video renderer is capable of achieving both
clearer dynamic details and more robust performance even on accessible short
videos with only 2k - 4k frames.</span>

learning involves limitations of labelled samples. For the task of
classification, techniques such as meta-learning, zero-shot learning, and
few-shot learning showcase the ability to learn information about novel classes
based on prior knowledge. Recent techniques try to learn a cross-modal mapping
between the semantic space and the image space. However, they tend to ignore
the local and global semantic knowledge. To overcome this problem, we propose a
Multimodal Variational Auto-Encoder (M-VAE) which can learn the shared latent
space of image features and the semantic space. In our approach we concatenate
multimodal data to a single embedding before passing it to the VAE for learning
the latent space. We propose the use of a multi-modal loss during the
reconstruction of the feature embedding through the decoder. Our approach is
capable to correlating modalities and exploit the local and global semantic
knowledge for novel sample predictions. Our experimental results using a MLP
classifier on four benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms
the current state-of-the-art approaches for generalized zero-shot learning.</span>

                                        <span>Image style transfer aims to manipulate the appearance of a source image, or
&quot;content&quot; image, to share similar texture and colors of a target &quot;style&quot; image.
Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic
content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring
styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based
optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and
their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated
with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style
image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware
multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while
preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We
achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification
to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our
method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations
between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We
validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user
study conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method
is simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when
targeting images that have multiple styles. Source code is available at

improved drastically in the past few years. Despite their impressive
performance, object detectors suffer from a lack of interpretability.
Visualization techniques have been developed and widely applied to introspect
the decisions made by other kinds of deep learning models; however, visualizing
object detectors has been underexplored. In this paper, we propose using
inversion as a primary tool to understand modern object detectors and develop
an optimization-based approach to layout inversion, allowing us to generate
synthetic images recognized by trained detectors as containing a desired
configuration of objects. We reveal intriguing properties of detectors by
applying our layout inversion technique to a variety of modern object
detectors, and further investigate them via validation experiments: they rely
on qualitatively different features for classification and regression; they
learn canonical motifs of commonly co-occurring objects; they use diff erent
visual cues to recognize objects of varying sizes. We hope our insights can
help practitioners improve object detectors.</span>

                                        <span>When trained at sufficient scale, auto-regressive language models exhibit the
notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

counterpart in deep learning. Earlier works used the steering theorems and
presented convolutional networks equivariant to rigid transformations. In our
work, we propose a steerable feed-forward learning-based approach that consists
of spherical decision surfaces and operates on point clouds. Due to the
inherent geometric 3D structure of our theory, we derive a 3D steerability
constraint for its atomic parts, the hypersphere neurons. Exploiting the
rotational equivariance, we show how the model parameters are fully steerable
at inference time. The proposed spherical filter banks enable to make
equivariant and, after online optimization, invariant class predictions for
known synthetic point sets in unknown orientations.</span>

                                        <span>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely used for dimensionality
reduction and feature extraction. Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust
distance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or
outliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that
can not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing
methods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning
pattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex
and less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called
Self-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.
Notably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each
iteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into
training. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal
projection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is
presented to show the rationality of SPCA. Extensive experiments on popular
data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the state of-the-art
results considerably.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative inference enables resource-constrained edge devices to make
inferences by uploading inputs (e.g., images) to a server (i.e., cloud) where
the heavy deep learning models run. While this setup works cost-effectively for
successful inferences, it severely underperforms when the model faces input
samples on which the model was not trained (known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
samples). If the edge devices could, at least, detect that an input sample is
an OOD, that could potentially save communication and computation resources by
not uploading those inputs to the server for inference workload. In this paper,
we propose a novel lightweight OOD detection approach that mines important
features from the shallow layers of a pretrained CNN model and detects an input
sample as ID (In-Distribution) or OOD based on a distance function defined on
the reduced feature space. Our technique (a) works on pretrained models without
any retraining of those models, and (b) does not expose itself to any OOD
dataset (all detection parameters are obtained from the ID training dataset).
To this end, we develop EARLIN (EARLy OOD detection for Collaborative
INference) that takes a pretrained model and partitions the model at the OOD
detection layer and deploys the considerably small OOD part on an edge device
and the rest on the cloud. By experimenting using real datasets and a prototype
implementation, we show that our technique achieves better results than other
approaches in terms of overall accuracy and cost when tested against popular
OOD datasets on top of popular deep learning models pretrained on benchmark
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Highly constrained manipulation tasks continue to be challenging for
autonomous robots as they require high levels of precision, typically less than
1mm, which is often incompatible with what can be achieved by traditional
perception systems. This paper demonstrates that the combination of
state-of-the-art object tracking with passively adaptive mechanical hardware
can be leveraged to complete precision manipulation tasks with tight,
industrially-relevant tolerances (0.25mm). The proposed control method closes
the loop through vision by tracking the relative 6D pose of objects in the
relevant workspace. It adjusts the control reference of both the compliant
manipulator and the hand to complete object insertion tasks via within-hand
manipulation. Contrary to previous efforts for insertion, our method does not
require expensive force sensors, precision manipulators, or time-consuming,
online learning, which is data hungry. Instead, this effort leverages
mechanical compliance and utilizes an object agnostic manipulation model of the
hand learned offline, off-the-shelf motion planning, and an RGBD-based object
tracker trained solely with synthetic data. These features allow the proposed
system to easily generalize and transfer to new tasks and environments. This
paper describes in detail the system components and showcases its efficacy with
extensive experiments involving tight tolerance peg-in-hole insertion tasks of
various geometries as well as open-world constrained placement tasks.</span>

intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we
advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers
real-world deployment.</span>

ResNeXt-56 are severely over-parameterized, necessitating a consequent increase
in the computational resources required for model training which scales
exponentially for increments in model depth. In this paper, we propose an
Entropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust
and simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization
with regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a
priori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to
determine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity
transformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for
enhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature
compression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing
training time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We
present empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,
yet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or
outperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.
The EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models
restrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available
computational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique
for researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for
CNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was
established on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,
MNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and
EfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any
conclusive claims presented in this paper.</span>

                                        <span>In computer vision, recovering spatial information by filling in masked
regions, e.g., inpainting, has been widely investigated for its usability and
wide applicability to other various applications: image inpainting, image
extrapolation, and environment map estimation. Most of them are studied
separately depending on the applications. Our focus, however, is on
accommodating the opposite task, e.g., image outpainting, which would benefit
the target applications, e.g., image inpainting. Our self-supervision method,
In-N-Out, is summarized as a training approach that leverages the knowledge of
the opposite task into the target model. We empirically show that In-N-Out --
which explores the complementary information -- effectively takes advantage
over the traditional pipelines where only task-specific learning takes place in
training. In experiments, we compare our method to the traditional procedure
and analyze the effectiveness of our method on different applications: image
inpainting, image extrapolation, and environment map estimation. For these
tasks, we demonstrate that In-N-Out consistently improves the performance of
the recent works with In-N-Out self-supervision to their training procedure.
Also, we show that our approach achieves better results than an existing
training approach for outpainting.</span>

                                        <span>The recurrent mechanism has recently been introduced into U-Net in various
medical image segmentation tasks. Existing studies have focused on promoting
network recursion via reusing building blocks. Although network parameters
could be greatly saved, computational costs still increase inevitably in
accordance with the pre-set iteration time. In this work, we study a
multi-scale upgrade of a bi-directional skip connected network and then
automatically discover an efficient architecture by a novel two-phase Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, namely BiX-NAS. Our proposed method
reduces the network computational cost by sifting out ineffective multi-scale
features at different levels and iterations. We evaluate BiX-NAS on two
segmentation tasks using three different medical image datasets, and the
experimental results show that our BiX-NAS searched architecture achieves the
state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational cost.</span>

feature mapping of the last layer to obtain the prediction output. However, it
can be difficulty to settle the optimal network depth and make the middle
layers learn distinguished features. This paper proposes the Interflow
algorithm specially for traditional CNN models. Interflow divides CNNs into
several stages according to the depth and makes predictions by the feature
mappings in each stage. Subsequently, we input these prediction branches into a
well-designed attention module, which learns the weights of these prediction
branches, aggregates them and obtains the final output. Interflow weights and
fuses the features learned in both shallower and deeper layers, making the
feature information at each stage processed reasonably and effectively,
enabling the middle layers to learn more distinguished features, and enhancing
the model representation ability. In addition, Interflow can alleviate gradient
vanishing problem, lower the difficulty of network depth selection, and lighten
possible over-fitting problem by introducing attention mechanism. Besides, it
can avoid network degradation as a byproduct. Compared with the original model,
the CNN model with Interflow achieves higher test accuracy on multiple
benchmark datasets.</span>

classifier on a given input datum. Deep neural networks commonly used for image
classification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.
As such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must
specify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and
interpreting &quot;confidence.&quot; To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,
which is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response
to data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the
given image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated
the given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other
than the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,
ensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative
adversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view
reconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior
obtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video. These
developments are only a small step towards assessing the reliability of deep
network classifiers in a manner that is compatible with safety-critical
applications.</span>

associated with image classification using machine learning algorithms, named
the nonuniform defocus removal (NDR) problem. Mathematical analysis of the NDR
problem is done and the so-called defocus removal (DR) algorithm for solving it
is proposed. Global convergence of the DR algorithm is established without
imposing any unverifiable assumption. Numerical results on simulation data show
significant features of DR including solvability, noise robustness,
convergence, model insensitivity and computational efficiency. Physical
relevance of the NDR problem and practicability of the DR algorithm are tested
on experimental data. Back to the application that originally motivated the
investigation of the NDR problem, we show that the DR algorithm can improve the
accuracy of classifying distorted images using convolutional neural networks.
The key difference of this paper compared to most existing works on
single-frame anisoplanatic deconvolution is that the new method does not
require the data image to be decomposable into isoplanatic subregions.
Therefore, solution approaches partitioning the image into isoplanatic zones
are not applicable to the NDR problem and those handling the entire image such
as the DR algorithm need to be developed and analyzed.</span>

for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Concretely, this network contains
two parts that separately named spatial graph reasoning subnetwork (SAGRN) and
spectral graph reasoning subnetwork (SEGRN) to capture the spatial and spectral
graph contexts, respectively. Different from the previous approaches
implementing superpixel segmentation on the original image or attempting to
obtain the category features under the guide of label image, we perform the
superpixel segmentation on intermediate features of the network to adaptively
produce the homogeneous regions to get the effective descriptors. Then, we
adopt a similar idea in spectral part that reasonably aggregating the channels
to generate spectral descriptors for spectral graph contexts capturing. All
graph reasoning procedures in SAGRN and SEGRN are achieved through graph
convolution. To guarantee the global perception ability of the proposed
methods, all adjacent matrices in graph reasoning are obtained with the help of
non-local self-attention mechanism. At last, by combining the extracted spatial
and spectral graph contexts, we obtain the SSGRN to achieve a high accuracy
classification. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three

                                        <span>In this paper, we leverage the properties of non-Euclidean Geometry to define
the Geodesic distance (GD) on the space of statistical manifolds. The Geodesic
distance is a real and intuitive similarity measure that is a good alternative
to the purely statistical and extensively used Kullback-Leibler divergence
(KLD). Despite the effectiveness of the GD, a closed-form does not exist for
many manifolds, since the geodesic equations are hard to solve. This explains
that the major studies have been content to use numerical approximations.
Nevertheless, most of those do not take account of the manifold properties,
which leads to a loss of information and thus to low performances. We propose
an approximation of the Geodesic distance through a graph-based method. This
latter permits to well represent the structure of the statistical manifold, and
respects its geometrical properties. Our main aim is to compare the graph-based
approximation to the state of the art approximations. Thus, the proposed
approach is evaluated for two statistical manifolds, namely the Weibull
manifold and the Gamma manifold, considering the Content-Based Texture
Retrieval application on different databases.</span>

in the field of high dimensional data classification. In this paper, we present
a novel classification framework using functional data and classwise Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). Our proposed method can be used in high dimensional
time series data which typically suffers from small sample size problem. Our
method extracts a piece wise linear functional feature space and is
particularly suitable for hard classification problems.The proposed framework
converts time series data into functional data and uses classwise functional
PCA for feature extraction followed by classification using a Bayesian linear
classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method by applying it
to both synthetic data sets and real time series data from diverse fields
including but not limited to neuroscience, food science, medical sciences and
chemometrics.</span>

yarn geometrical features in woven composites so that a direct parametrization
of the textile reinforcement is achieved (e.g., FE mesh). Thus, our aim is not
only to perform yarn segmentation from tomographic images but rather to provide
a complete descriptive modeling of the fabric. As such, this direct approach
improves on previous methods that use voxel-wise masks as intermediate
representations followed by re-meshing operations (yarn envelope estimation).
The proposed approach employs two deep neural network architectures (U-Net and
Mask RCNN). First, we train the U-Net to generate synthetic CT images from the
corresponding FE simulations. This allows to generate large quantities of
annotated data without requiring costly manual annotations. This data is then
used to train the Mask R-CNN, which is focused on predicting contour points
around each of the yarns in the image. Experimental results show that our
method is accurate and robust for performing yarn instance segmentation on CT
images, this is further validated by quantitative and qualitative analyses.</span>

domain translation problem between different sensor modalities with unique data
formats. By relying only on the semantics of the scene, our modular generative
framework can, for the first time, synthesize a panoramic color image from a
given full 3D LiDAR point cloud. The framework starts with semantic
segmentation of the point cloud, which is initially projected onto a spherical
surface. The same semantic segmentation is applied to the corresponding camera
image. Next, our new conditional generative model adversarially learns to
translate the predicted LiDAR segment maps to the camera image counterparts.
Finally, generated image segments are processed to render the panoramic scene
images. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the SemanticKitti
dataset and show that our proposed framework outperforms other strong baseline
models.

                                        <span>Modern E-commerce websites contain heterogeneous sources of information, such
as numerical ratings, textual reviews and images. These information can be
utilized to assist recommendation. Through textual reviews, a user explicitly
express her affinity towards the item. Previous researchers found that by using
the information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users&#x27;
explicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement
of recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were
only utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating
prediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as
top-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully
explored. Seeing this gap, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
textual review information for top-N recommendation under E-commerce settings.
We adapt several SOTA review-based rating prediction models for top-N
recommendation tasks and compare them to existing top-N recommendation models
from both performance and efficiency. We find that models utilizing only review
information can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback
matrix factorization method. When utilizing review information as a regularizer
or auxiliary information, the performance of implicit-feedback matrix
factorization method can be further improved. However, the optimal model
structure to utilize textual reviews for E-commerce top-N recommendation is yet
to be determined.</span>

                                        <span>Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users&#x27; historical behaviors to
predict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main
challenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich
historical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they
cannot sufficiently reflect users&#x27; actual preferences. In addition, users&#x27;
dynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult
to capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we
propose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential
Recommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues.
Specifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user
behaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences
into tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps
explicitly distinguish users&#x27; core interests, by forming dense clusters in the
interest graph. Then, we perform cluster-aware and query-aware graph
convolutional propagation and graph pooling on the constructed graph. It
dynamically fuses and extracts users&#x27; current activated core interests from
noisy user behavior sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on both public
and proprietary industrial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance gains of our proposed method compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Further studies on sequence length confirm that our
method can model long behavioral sequences effectively and efficiently.</span>

hampered by the difficulty of gathering enough annotated data for training deep
learning methods, giving rise to a variety of small datasets and associated
dataset-specific methods. Moreover, typical tasks such as classification and
retrieval lack a systematic evaluation on standard benchmarks and training
datasets, which make it hard to identify durable and generalizable scientific
contributions. We aim at unifying remote sensing image retrieval and
classification with a new large-scale training and testing dataset, SF300,
including both vertical and oblique aerial images and made available to the
research community, and an associated fine-tuning method. We additionally

                                        <span>Most sequential recommendation models capture the features of consecutive
items in a user-item interaction history. Though effective, their
representation expressiveness is still hindered by the sparse learning signals.
As a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent
predictions. In this paper, we propose a model, \textbf{SSI}, to improve
sequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.
Precisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three
self-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona
consistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological
order and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the
model with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by
maximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.
Finally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of
consistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning
framework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and
transferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit
as well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the
flexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student
recommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively
outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.</span>

content delivery. The trend now is to create presentations, and then
subsequently deliver the same using various virtual meeting platforms. The time
being spent in such creation of presentations and delivering is what we try to
reduce and eliminate through this paper which aims to use Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules to automate the
process of creating a slides-based presentation from a document, and then use
state-of-the-art voice cloning models to deliver the content in the desired
author&#x27;s voice. We consider a structured document such as a research paper to
be the content that has to be presented. The research paper is first summarized
using BERT summarization techniques and condensed into bullet points that go
into the slides. Tacotron inspired architecture with Encoder, Synthesizer, and
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder, is used to convey the
contents of the slides in the author&#x27;s voice (or any customized voice). Almost
all learning has now been shifted to online mode, and professionals are now
working from the comfort of their homes. Due to the current situation, teachers
and professionals have shifted to presentations to help them in imparting
information. In this paper, we aim to reduce the considerable amount of time
that is taken in creating a presentation by automating this process and
subsequently delivering this presentation in a customized voice, using a
content delivery mechanism that can clone any voice using a short audio clip.</span>

automation of the working process of the Indian Judiciary System. The manual
working procedures and documentation at any level (from lower to higher court)
of the judiciary system are very complex in nature. The systems produced as a
part of this track would assist the law practitioners. It would be helpful for
common men too. This kind of track also opens the path of research of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in the judicial domain. This track defined two
problems such as Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation
and Task 2: Identifying the most relevant statutes for a given situation. We
tackled both of them. Our proposed approaches are based on BM25 and Doc2Vec. As
per the results declared by the task organizers, we are in 3rd and a modest
position in Task 1 and Task 2 respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as
human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the
users&#x27; bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although
researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional
manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis
disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method
to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as
personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically
dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an
attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the
tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative
knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a
dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,
reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine
that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.
Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based
algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the
prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis
results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the
proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the
adaptive tree.</span>

technical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant
decision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a
higher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document
classification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for
classification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel
multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document
classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to
train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training
process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document
database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the
hierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that
the trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than
those using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.
The trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical
documents with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge
management in large technology companies and organizations.</span>

                                        <span>One key property in recommender systems is the long-tail distribution in
user-item interactions where most items only have few user feedback. Improving
the recommendation of tail items can promote novelty and bring positive effects
to both users and providers, and thus is a desirable property of recommender
systems. Current novel recommendation studies over-emphasize the importance of
tail items without differentiating the degree of users&#x27; intent on popularity
and often incur a sharp decline of accuracy. Moreover, none of existing methods
has ever taken the extreme case of tail items, i.e., cold-start items without
any interaction, into consideration.

In this work, we first disclose the mechanism that drives a user&#x27;s
interaction towards popular or niche items by disentangling her intent into
conformity influence (popularity) and personal interests (preference). We then
present a unified end-to-end framework to simultaneously optimize accuracy and
novelty targets based on the disentangled intent of popularity and that of
preference. We further develop a new paradigm for novel recommendation of
cold-start items which exploits the self-supervised learning technique to model
the correlation between collaborative features and content features. We conduct
extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets. The results
demonstrate that our proposed model yields significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, novelty, coverage, and
trade-off.</span>

duties of multi-sided recommender systems. Item providers are key stakeholders
in online platforms, and their earnings and plans are influenced by the
exposure their items receive in recommended lists. Prior work showed that
certain minority groups of providers, characterized by a common sensitive
attribute (e.g., gender or race), are being disproportionately affected by
indirect and unintentional discrimination. Our study in this paper handles a
situation where ($i$) the same provider is associated with multiple items of a
list suggested to a user, ($ii$) an item is created by more than one provider
jointly, and ($iii$) predicted user-item relevance scores are biasedly
estimated for items of provider groups. Under this scenario, we assess
disparities in relevance, visibility, and exposure, by simulating diverse
representations of the minority group in the catalog and the interactions.
Based on emerged unfair outcomes, we devise a treatment that combines
observation upsampling and loss regularization, while learning user-item
relevance scores. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our treatment
leads to lower disparate relevance. The resulting recommended lists show fairer
visibility and exposure, higher minority item coverage, and negligible loss in
recommendation utility.</span>

ranking information. However, their outputs are often subjected to bias that
can lead to skewed representation of subjects such as professional occupations
or gender. In our paper, we use a mixed-method approach to investigate presence
of race and gender bias in representation of artificial intelligence (AI) in
image search results coming from six different search engines. Our findings
show that search engines prioritize anthropomorphic images of AI that portray
it as white, whereas non-white images of AI are present only in non-Western
search engines. By contrast, gender representation of AI is more diverse and
less skewed towards a specific gender that can be attributed to higher
awareness about gender bias in search outputs. Our observations indicate both
the the need and the possibility for addressing bias in representation of
societally relevant subjects, such as technological innovation, and emphasize
the importance of designing new approaches for detecting bias in information
retrieval systems.</span>

can enable the use of radiology report information for a variety of critical
healthcare applications. In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of
entities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a
novel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.
We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist
annotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579
entities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two
independent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology
reports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these
datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR
and CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference
dataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph
Benchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4
million relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908

                                        <span>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used algorithms
in reinforcement learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in many
challenging problems. The keys to its success are the reliable policy updates
through the clipping mechanism and the multiple epochs of minibatch updates.
The aim of this research is to give new simple but effective alternatives to
the former. For this, we propose linearly and exponentially decaying clipping
range approaches throughout the training. With these, we would like to provide
higher exploration at the beginning and stronger restrictions at the end of the
learning phase. We investigate their performance in several classical control
and locomotive robotic environments. During the analysis, we found that they
influence the achieved rewards and are effective alternatives to the constant
clipping method in many reinforcement learning tasks.</span>

                                        <span>An in-depth understanding of the particular environment is crucial in
reinforcement learning (RL). To address this challenge, the decision-making
process of a mobile collaborative robotic assistant modeled by the Markov
decision process (MDP) framework is studied in this paper. The optimal
state-action combinations of the MDP are calculated with the non-linear Bellman
optimality equations. This system of equations can be solved with relative ease
by the computational power of Wolfram Mathematica, where the obtained optimal
action-values point to the optimal policy. Unlike other RL algorithms, this
methodology does not approximate the optimal behavior, it gives the exact,
explicit solution, which provides a strong foundation for our study. With this,
we offer new insights into understanding the action selection mechanisms in RL
by presenting various small modifications on the very same schema that lead to
different optimal policies.</span>

                                        <span>Consider a regression problem where the learner is given a large collection
of $d$-dimensional data points, but can only query a small subset of the
real-valued labels. How many queries are needed to obtain a $1+\epsilon$
relative error approximation of the optimum? While this problem has been
extensively studied for least squares regression, little is known for other
losses. An important example is least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$
regression) which enjoys superior robustness to outliers compared to least
squares. We develop a new framework for analyzing importance sampling methods
in regression problems, which enables us to show that the query complexity of
least absolute deviation regression is $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ up to logarithmic
factors. We further extend our techniques to show the first bounds on the query
complexity for any $\ell_p$ loss with $p\in(1,2)$. As a key novelty in our
analysis, we introduce the notion of robust uniform convergence, which is a new
approximation guarantee for the empirical loss. While it is inspired by uniform
convergence in statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a
correction term to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers. This can be
viewed as a new connection between statistical learning theory and variance
reduction techniques in stochastic optimization, which should be of independent
interest.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically
based on supervised learning, which requires a large number of ground-truth
labels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive
to obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor
disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and
consistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time.
Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a
multivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI
and a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across
acquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by
self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce
change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this
model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard
autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the
image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to
highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and
revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and
neuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL
facilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher
(or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation
learning techniques.</span>

performance in uncertainty estimation and lead to accuracy improvement. In this
work, we focus on a classification problem and investigate the behavior of both
non-calibrated and calibrated negative log-likelihood (CNLL) of a deep ensemble
as a function of the ensemble size and the member network size. We indicate the
conditions under which CNLL follows a power law w.r.t. ensemble size or member
network size, and analyze the dynamics of the parameters of the discovered
power laws. Our important practical finding is that one large network may
perform worse than an ensemble of several medium-size networks with the same
total number of parameters (we call this ensemble a memory split). Using the
detected power law-like dependencies, we can predict (1) the possible gain from
the ensembling of networks with given structure, (2) the optimal memory split
given a memory budget, based on a relatively small number of trained networks.

                                        <span>Signal processing, communications, and control have traditionally relied on
classical statistical modeling techniques. Such model-based methods utilize
mathematical formulations that represent the underlying physics, prior
information and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical models are useful
but sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real
systems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely
data-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly
popular as datasets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning
pipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures
which learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance,
especially for supervised problems. However, DNNs typically require massive
amounts of data and immense computational resources, limiting their
applicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid
techniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems
to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep
learning methods exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical
structures designed for specific problems, as well as learning from limited
data. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and
designing model-based deep learning systems. We divide hybrid
model-based/data-driven systems into categories based on their inference
mechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for
combining model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner,
along with concrete guidelines and detailed signal processing oriented examples
from recent literature. Our aim is to facilitate the design and study of future
systems on the intersection of signal processing and machine learning that
incorporate the advantages of both domains.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving
impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet,
obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling
function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple
sum or average over all node representations considers all node features
equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural
dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods,
on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs
that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally
preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of
existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as
a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph
structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head
attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between
nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies
both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as
powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods
can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for
hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph
classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains
even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.</span>

their convergence rates and ultimate accuracy as a function of the problem
structure. Such instance-specific behavior is not captured by existing global
minimax bounds, which are worst-case in nature. We analyze the problem of
estimating optimal $Q$-value functions for a discounted Markov decision process
with discrete states and actions and identify an instance-dependent functional
that controls the difficulty of estimation in the $\ell_\infty$-norm. Using a
local minimax framework, we show that this functional arises in lower bounds on
the accuracy on any estimation procedure. In the other direction, we establish
the sharpness of our lower bounds, up to factors logarithmic in the state and
action spaces, by analyzing a variance-reduced version of $Q$-learning. Our
theory provides a precise way of distinguishing &quot;easy&quot; problems from &quot;hard&quot;

                                        <span>In this work, we focus on large graph similarity computation problem and
propose a novel &quot;embedding-coarsening-matching&quot; learning framework, which
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in this task and has significant
improvement in time efficiency. Graph similarity computation for metrics such
as Graph Edit Distance (GED) is typically NP-hard, and existing
heuristics-based algorithms usually achieves a unsatisfactory trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency. Recently the development of deep learning techniques
provides a promising solution for this problem by a data-driven approach which
trains a network to encode graphs to their own feature vectors and computes
similarity based on feature vectors. These deep-learning methods can be
classified to two categories, embedding models and matching models. Embedding
models such as GCN-Mean and GCN-Max, which directly map graphs to respective
feature vectors, run faster but the performance is usually poor due to the lack
of interactions across graphs. Matching models such as GMN, whose encoding
process involves interaction across the two graphs, are more accurate but
interaction between whole graphs brings a significant increase in time
consumption (at least quadratic time complexity over number of nodes). Inspired
by large biological molecular identification where the whole molecular is first
mapped to functional groups and then identified based on these functional
groups, our &quot;embedding-coarsening-matching&quot; learning framework first embeds and
coarsens large graphs to coarsened graphs with denser local topology and then
matching mechanism is deployed on the coarsened graphs for the final similarity
scores. Detailed experiments have been conducted and the results demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed framework.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools in learning sophisticated but
fixed mapping rules between inputs and outputs, thereby limiting their
application in more complex and dynamic situations in which the mapping rules
are not kept the same but changing according to different contexts. To lift
such limits, we developed a novel approach involving a learning algorithm,
called orthogonal weights modification (OWM), with the addition of a
context-dependent processing (CDP) module. We demonstrated that with OWM to
overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, and the CDP module to learn
how to reuse a feature representation and a classifier for different contexts,
a single network can acquire numerous context-dependent mapping rules in an
online and continual manner, with as few as $\sim$10 samples to learn each.
This should enable highly compact systems to gradually learn myriad
regularities of the real world and eventually behave appropriately within it.</span>

                                        <span>As predictive models are increasingly being deployed to make a variety of
consequential decisions, there is a growing emphasis on designing algorithms
that can provide recourse to affected individuals. Existing recourse algorithms
function under the assumption that the underlying predictive model does not
change. However, models are regularly updated in practice for several reasons
including data distribution shifts. In this work, we make the first attempt at
understanding how model updates resulting from data distribution shifts impact
the algorithmic recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms. We carry
out a rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis to address the above
question. Our theoretical results establish a lower bound on the probability of
recourse invalidation due to model shifts, and show the existence of a tradeoff
between this invalidation probability and typical notions of &quot;cost&quot; minimized
by modern recourse generation algorithms. We experiment with multiple synthetic
and real world datasets, capturing different kinds of distribution shifts
including temporal shifts, geospatial shifts, and shifts due to data
correction. These experiments demonstrate that model updation due to all the
aforementioned distribution shifts can potentially invalidate recourses
generated by state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings thus not only expose
previously unknown flaws in the current recourse generation paradigm, but also
pave the way for fundamentally rethinking the design and development of
recourse generation algorithms.</span>

in the local model of differential privacy. Unlike in the non-private
literature, differentially private algorithms for the $k$-means objective incur
both additive and multiplicative errors. Our algorithm significantly reduces
the additive error while keeping the multiplicative error the same as in
previous state-of-the-art results. Specifically, on a database of size $n$, our
algorithm guarantees $O(1)$ multiplicative error and $\approx n^{1/2+a}$
additive error for an arbitrarily small constant $a&gt;0$. All previous algorithms
in the local model had additive error $\approx n^{2/3+a}$. Our techniques
extend to $k$-median clustering.

We show that the additive error we obtain is almost optimal in terms of its
dependency on the database size $n$. Specifically, we give a simple lower bound
showing that every locally-private algorithm for the $k$-means objective must
have additive error at least $\approx\sqrt{n}$.</span>

                                        <span>Object recognition in the real-world requires handling long-tailed or even
open-ended data. An ideal visual system needs to recognize the populated head
visual concepts reliably and meanwhile efficiently learn about emerging new
tail categories with a few training instances. Class-balanced many-shot
learning and few-shot learning tackle one side of this problem, by either
learning strong classifiers for head or learning to learn few-shot classifiers
for the tail. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot
learning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about
tail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes. We
propose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (CASTLE), a learning framework that
learns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the
multi-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary,
shedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive
version of CASTLE (ACASTLE) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the
incoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective
backward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with
classes from heterogeneous domains effectively. CASTLE and ACASTLE demonstrate
superior performances than existing GFSL algorithms and strong baselines on
MiniImageNet as well as TieredImageNet datasets. More interestingly, they
outperform previous state-of-the-art methods when evaluated with standard
few-shot learning criteria.</span>

                                        <span>Although achieving remarkable progress, it is very difficult to induce a
supervised classifier without any labeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation
is able to overcome this challenge by transferring knowledge from a labeled
source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Transferability and
discriminability are two key criteria for characterizing the superiority of
feature representations to enable successful domain adaptation. In this paper,
a novel method called \textit{learning TransFerable and Discriminative Features
for unsupervised domain adaptation} (TFDF) is proposed to optimize these two
objectives simultaneously. On the one hand, distribution alignment is performed
to reduce domain discrepancy and learn more transferable representations.
Instead of adopting \textit{Maximum Mean Discrepancy} (MMD) which only captures
the first-order statistical information to measure distribution discrepancy, we
adopt a recently proposed statistic called \textit{Maximum Mean and Covariance
Discrepancy} (MMCD), which can not only capture the first-order statistical
information but also capture the second-order statistical information in the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). On the other hand, we propose to
explore both local discriminative information via manifold regularization and
global discriminative information via minimizing the proposed \textit{class
confusion} objective to learn more discriminative features, respectively. We
integrate these two objectives into the \textit{Structural Risk Minimization}
(RSM) framework and learn a domain-invariant classifier. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets and the results verify
the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

system, which is used to perceive the surrounding world. While making a
prediction, the human brain tends to relate crucial cues from multiple sources
of information. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion module that
learns to emphasize more contributive features across all modalities.
Specifically, the proposed Multimodal Split Attention Fusion (MSAF) module
splits each modality into channel-wise equal feature blocks and creates a joint
representation that is used to generate soft attention for each channel across
the feature blocks. Further, the MSAF module is designed to be compatible with
features of various spatial dimensions and sequence lengths, suitable for both
CNNs and RNNs. Thus, MSAF can be easily added to fuse features of any unimodal
networks and utilize existing pretrained unimodal model weights. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our fusion module, we design three multimodal networks
with MSAF for emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition
tasks. Our approach achieves competitive results in each task and outperforms
other application-specific networks and multimodal fusion benchmarks.</span>

user knowledge and statistical data. The algorithms have two components: a
scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network
structure, statistical data, and a user&#x27;s prior knowledge, and returns a score
proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the
data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring
metric. Previous work has concentrated on metrics for domains containing only
discrete variables, under the assumption that data represents a multinomial
sample. In this paper, we extend this work, developing scoring metrics for
domains containing all continuous variables or a mixture of discrete and
continuous variables, under the assumption that continuous data is sampled from
a multivariate normal distribution. Our work extends traditional statistical
approaches for identifying vanishing regression coefficients in that we
identify two important assumptions, called event equivalence and parameter
modularity, that when combined allow the construction of prior distributions
for multivariate normal parameters from a single prior Bayesian network

                                        <span>We study the asymmetric low-rank factorization problem: \[\min_{\mathbf{U}
\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}, \mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}}
\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top -\mathbf{\Sigma}\|_F^2\] where
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a given matrix of size $m \times n$ and rank $d$. This is
a canonical problem that admits two difficulties in optimization: 1)
non-convexity and 2) non-smoothness (due to unbalancedness of $\mathbf{U}$ and
$\mathbf{V}$). This is also a prototype for more complex problems such as
asymmetric matrix sensing and matrix completion. Despite being non-convex and
non-smooth, it has been observed empirically that the randomly initialized
gradient descent algorithm can solve this problem in polynomial time. Existing
theories to explain this phenomenon all require artificial modifications of the
algorithm, such as adding noise in each iteration and adding a balancing
regularizer to balance the $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$.

This paper presents the first proof that shows randomly initialized gradient
descent converges to a global minimum of the asymmetric low-rank factorization
problem with a polynomial rate. For the proof, we develop 1) a new
symmetrization technique to capture the magnitudes of the symmetry and
asymmetry, and 2) a quantitative perturbation analysis to approximate matrix
derivatives. We believe both are useful for other related non-convex problems.</span>

the classical two-dimensional (2D) RadViz that visualizes multivariate data in
the 2D plane by mapping every observation to a point inside the unit circle. We
show that distributing anchor points uniformly on the 3D unit sphere provides
the best visualization with minimal artificial visual correlation for data with
uncorrelated variables. However, anchor points can be placed exactly
equi-distant from each other only for the five Platonic solids. We provide
equi-distant anchor points for these five settings, and approximately
equi-distant anchor points via a Fibonacci grid for the other cases. Our
methodology, implemented in the R package $radviz3d$, makes fully 3D RadViz
possible and is shown to improve clarity of this nonlinear display technique on

constant increase in contribution to the electrical power grids. Solar energy
is one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is
dependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical
power grids, forecasting models that predict solar irradiation, with high
accuracy, are needed. In the current study, Machine Learning techniques such as
Linear Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Genetic Algorithm Optimization
are used to forecast solar irradiation. The data used for training and
validation is recorded from across three different geographical stations in the
United States that are part of the SURFRAD network. A Global Horizontal Index
(GHI) is predicted for the models built and compared. Genetic Algorithm
Optimization is applied to XGB to further improve the accuracy of solar

object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as
healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural
architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior
experience on the researchers&#x27; behalf. More recently, this process of finding
the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible
operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper,
we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS)
against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with
carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance
on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space
poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design
flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for
child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in
using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.</span>

                                        <span>One approach to understanding complex data is to study its shape through the
lens of algebraic topology. While the early development of topological data
analysis focused primarily on static data, in recent years, theoretical and
applied studies have turned to data that varies in time. A time-varying
collection of metric spaces as formed, for example, by a moving school of fish
or flock of birds, can contain a vast amount of information. There is often a
need to simplify or summarize the dynamic behavior. We provide an introduction
to topological summaries of time-varying metric spaces including vineyards
[19], crocker plots [56], and multiparameter rank functions [37]. We then
introduce a new tool to summarize time-varying metric spaces: a crocker stack.
Crocker stacks are convenient for visualization, amenable to machine learning,
and satisfy a desirable continuity property which we prove. We demonstrate the
utility of crocker stacks for a parameter identification task involving an
influential model of biological aggregations [58]. Altogether, we aim to bring
the broader applied mathematics community up-to-date on topological summaries
of time-varying metric spaces.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-40 and
ResNeXt-56 are severely over-parameterized, necessitating a consequent increase
in the computational resources required for model training which scales
exponentially for increments in model depth. In this paper, we propose an
Entropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust
and simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization
with regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a
priori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to
determine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity
transformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for
enhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature
compression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing
training time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We
present empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,
yet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or
outperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.
The EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models
restrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available
computational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique
for researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for
CNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was
established on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,
MNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and
EfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any
conclusive claims presented in this paper.</span>

                                        <span>Image registration has been widely studied over the past several decades,
with numerous applications in science, engineering and medicine. Most of the
conventional mathematical models for large deformation image registration rely
on prescribed landmarks, which usually require tedious manual labeling and are
prone to error. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the use
of machine learning for image registration. In this paper, we develop a novel
method for large deformation image registration by a fusion of quasiconformal
theory and convolutional neural network (CNN). More specifically, we propose a
quasiconformal energy model with a novel fidelity term that incorporates the
features extracted using a pre-trained CNN, thereby allowing us to obtain
meaningful registration results without any guidance of prescribed landmarks.
Moreover, unlike many prior image registration methods, the bijectivity of our
method is guaranteed by quasiconformal theory. Experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. More
broadly, our work sheds light on how rigorous mathematical theories and
practical machine learning approaches can be integrated for developing
computational methods with improved performance.</span>

                                        <span>The recent advent of various forms of Federated Knowledge Distillation (FD)
paves the way for a new generation of robust and communication-efficient
Federated Learning (FL), where mere soft-labels are aggregated, rather than
whole gradients of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) as done in previous FL schemes.
This security-per-design approach in combination with increasingly performant
Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices opens up a new realm of
possibilities to utilize private data from industries as well as from
individuals as input for artificial intelligence model training. Yet in
previous FL systems, lack of trust due to the imbalance of power between
workers and a central authority, the assumption of altruistic worker
participation and the inability to correctly measure and compare contributions
of workers hinder this technology from scaling beyond small groups of already
entrusted entities towards mass adoption. This work aims to mitigate the
aforementioned issues by introducing a novel decentralized federated learning
framework where heavily compressed 1-bit soft-labels, resembling 1-hot label
predictions, are aggregated on a smart contract. In a context where workers&#x27;
contributions are now easily comparable, we modify the Peer Truth Serum for
Crowdsourcing mechanism (PTSC) for FD to reward honest participation based on
peer consistency in an incentive compatible fashion. Due to heavy reductions of
both computational complexity and storage, our framework is a fully
on-blockchain FL system that is feasible on simple smart contracts and
therefore blockchain agnostic. We experimentally test our new framework and
validate its theoretical properties.</span>

we opened several possibilities within the field, applying modern Bayesian
Statistics techniques and developing efficient algorithms, focusing on the

was the development of a emotion-based music recommendation system, its main
contribution is a highly adaptable multivariate model that can be useful
interpreting any database where there is an interest in applying regularization

theoretical statistical analysis can play in the modeling of an algorithm that
is able to understand a well-known database and what can be gained with this

adapting the Mask R-CNN state-of-the-art image processing neural architecture

method learns to solve all 68 kinds of geometric construction problems from the
first six level packs of Euclidea with an average 92% accuracy. When evaluated
on new kinds of problems, the method can solve 31 of the 68 kinds of Euclidea

a novel unsupervised skill discovery method named Information Bottleneck Option

learn visual representations that can be transferred better to unseen tasks
than joint-training methods relying on task-specific supervision. In this
paper, we found that the similar holds in the continual learning con-text:
contrastively learned representations are more robust against the catastrophic
forgetting than jointly trained representations. Based on this novel
observation, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning algorithm that
focuses on continually learning and maintaining transferable representations.
More specifically, the proposed scheme (1) learns representations using the
contrastive learning objective, and (2) preserves learned representations using
a self-supervised distillation step. We conduct extensive experimental
validations under popular benchmark image classification datasets, where our
method sets the new state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>We present a new way of study of Mercer kernels, by corresponding to a
special kernel $K$ a pseudo-differential operator $p({\mathbf x}, D)$ such that
$\mathcal{F} p({\mathbf x}, D)^\dag p({\mathbf x}, D) \mathcal{F}^{-1}$ acts on
smooth functions in the same way as an integral operator associated with $K$
(where $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform). We show that kernels defined by
pseudo-differential operators are able to approximate uniformly any continuous
Mercer kernel on a compact set.

The symbol $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ encapsulates a lot of useful
information about the structure of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance
defined by the kernel $K$. We approximate $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ with
the sum of the first $r$ terms of the Singular Value Decomposition of $p$,
denoted by $p_r({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$. If ordered singular values of the
integral operator associated with $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ die down
rapidly, the MMD distance defined by the new symbol $p_r$ differs from the
initial one only slightly. Moreover, the new MMD distance can be interpreted as
an aggregated result of comparing $r$ local moments of two probability
distributions.

The latter results holds under the condition that right singular vectors of
the integral operator associated with $p$ are uniformly bounded. But even if
this is not satisfied we can still hold that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance
between $p$ and $p_r$ vanishes. Thus, we report an interesting phenomenon: the
MMD distance measures the difference of two probability distributions with
respect to a certain number of local moments, $r^\ast$, and this number
$r^\ast$ depends on the speed with which singular values of $p$ die down.</span>

achieve this property for a class of critical points. These theoretical

Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning. Given a fill-in-the-blank-type
question and a corresponding context, the task is to predict the most suitable
word from a list of 5 options. There are three sub-tasks within this task:
Imperceptibility (subtask-I), Non-Specificity (subtask-II), and Intersection
(subtask-III). We use encoders of transformers-based models pre-trained on the
masked language modelling (MLM) task to build our Fill-in-the-blank (FitB)
models. Moreover, to model imperceptibility, we define certain linguistic
features, and to model non-specificity, we leverage information from hypernyms
and hyponyms provided by a lexical database. Specifically, for non-specificity,
we try out augmentation techniques, and other statistical techniques. We also
propose variants, namely Chunk Voting and Max Context, to take care of input
length restrictions for BERT, etc. Additionally, we perform a thorough ablation
study, and use Integrated Gradients to explain our predictions on a few
samples. Our best submissions achieve accuracies of 75.31% and 77.84%, on the

combination of gradient clipping, momentum, and normalized gradient descent
yields convergence to critical points in high-probability with best-known rates
for smooth losses when the gradients only have bounded $\mathfrak{p}$th moments
for some $\mathfrak{p}\in(1,2]$. We then consider the case of second-order
smooth losses, which to our knowledge have not been studied in this setting,
and again obtain high-probability bounds for any $\mathfrak{p}$. Moreover, our
results hold for arbitrary smooth norms, in contrast to the typical SGD
analysis which requires a Hilbert space norm. Further, we show that after a
suitable &quot;burn-in&quot; period, the objective value will monotonically decrease for
every iteration until a critical point is identified, which provides intuition
behind the popular practice of learning rate &quot;warm-up&quot; and also yields a

of learning Nash equilibria in zero-sum stochastic games. We propose a new
Q-learning type algorithm that uses a sequence of entropy-regularized soft
policies to approximate the Nash policy during the Q-function updates. We prove
that under certain conditions, by updating the regularized Q-function, the
algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium. We also demonstrate the proposed
algorithm&#x27;s ability to transfer previous training experiences, enabling the
agents to adapt quickly to new environments. We provide a dynamic
hyper-parameter scheduling scheme to further expedite convergence. Empirical
results applied to a number of stochastic games verify that the proposed

                                        <span>K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)-based deep learning methods have been applied to
many applications due to their simplicity and geometric interpretability.
However, the robustness of kNN-based classification models has not been
thoroughly explored and kNN attack strategies are underdeveloped. In this
paper, we propose an Adversarial Soft kNN (ASK) loss to both design more
effective kNN attack strategies and to develop better defenses against them.
Our ASK loss approach has two advantages. First, ASK loss can better
approximate the kNN&#x27;s probability of classification error than objectives
proposed in previous works. Second, the ASK loss is interpretable: it preserves
the mutual information between the perturbed input and the kNN of the
unperturbed input. We use the ASK loss to generate a novel attack method called
the ASK-Attack (ASK-Atk), which shows superior attack efficiency and accuracy
degradation relative to previous kNN attacks. Based on the ASK-Atk, we then
derive an ASK-Defense (ASK-Def) method that optimizes the worst-case training
loss induced by ASK-Atk.</span>

                                        <span>With recent advances in deep learning, neuroimaging studies increasingly rely
on convolutional networks (ConvNets) to predict diagnosis based on MR images.
To gain a better understanding of how a disease impacts the brain, the studies
visualize the salience maps of the ConvNet highlighting voxels within the brain
majorly contributing to the prediction. However, these salience maps are
generally confounded, i.e., some salient regions are more predictive of
confounding variables (such as age) than the diagnosis. To avoid such
misinterpretation, we propose in this paper an approach that aims to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps that only highlight voxels predictive of the
diagnosis. The approach incorporates univariate statistical tests to identify
confounding effects within the intermediate features learned by ConvNet. The
influence from the subset of confounded features is then removed by a novel
partial back-propagation procedure. We use this two-step approach to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps extracted from synthetic and two real datasets.
These experiments reveal the potential of our visualization in producing
unbiased model-interpretation.</span>

                                        <span>Powerful deep learning algorithms open an opportunity for solving non-image
Machine Learning (ML) problems by transforming these problems to into the image
recognition problems. The CPC-R algorithm presented in this chapter converts
non-image data into images by visualizing non-image data. Then deep learning
CNN algorithms solve the learning problems on these images. The design of the
CPC-R algorithm allows preserving all high-dimensional information in 2-D
images. The use of pair values mapping instead of single value mapping used in
the alternative approaches allows encoding each n-D point with 2 times fewer
visual elements. The attributes of an n-D point are divided into pairs of its
values and each pair is visualized as 2-D points in the same 2-D Cartesian
coordinates. Next, grey scale or color intensity values are assigned to each
pair to encode the order of pairs. This is resulted in the heatmap image. The
computational experiments with CPC-R are conducted for different CNN
architectures, and methods to optimize the CPC-R images showing that the
combined CPC-R and deep learning CNN algorithms are able to solve non-image ML
problems reaching high accuracy on the benchmark datasets. This chapter expands
our prior work by adding more experiments to test accuracy of classification,
exploring saliency and informativeness of discovered features to test their
interpretability, and generalizing the approach.</span>

which modify input images to improve the classifier&#x27;s performance. In this
work, we combine the idea of STN with Reinforcement Learning (RL). To this end,
we break the affine transformation down into a sequence of simple and discrete
transformations. We formulate the task as a Markovian Decision Process (MDP)
and use RL to solve this sequential decision-making problem. STN architectures
learn the transformation parameters by minimizing the classification error and
backpropagating the gradients through a sub-differentiable sampling module. In
our method, we are not bound to the differentiability of the sampling modules.
Moreover, we have freedom in designing the objective rather than only
minimizing the error; e.g., we can directly set the target as maximizing the
accuracy. We design multiple experiments to verify the effectiveness of our
method using cluttered MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets and show that our
method outperforms STN with a proper definition of MDP components.</span>

routines to the problem of sparse signal recovery from noisy observation. Using
Stochastic Mirror Descent algorithm as a building block, we develop a
multistage procedure for recovery of sparse solutions to Stochastic
Optimization problem under assumption of smoothness and quadratic minoration on
the expected objective. An interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is
linear convergence of the approximate solution during the preliminary phase of
the routine when the component of stochastic error in the gradient observation
which is due to bad initial approximation of the optimal solution is larger
than the &quot;ideal&quot; asymptotic error component owing to observation noise &quot;at the
optimal solution.&quot; We also show how one can straightforwardly enhance
reliability of the corresponding solution by using Median-of-Means like
techniques.

We illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms in application to
classical problems of recovery of sparse and low rank signals in linear
regression framework. We show, under rather weak assumption on the regressor
and noise distributions, how they lead to parameter estimates which obey (up to
factors which are logarithmic in problem dimension and confidence level) the

the wind power forecasting field. However, deep learning-based wind power
forecasting studies have not investigated two aspects. In the first stage,
different learning structures considering multiple inputs and multiple outputs
have not been discussed. In the second stage, the model extrapolation issue has
not been investigated. Therefore, we develop four deep neural networks for the
first stage to learn data features considering the input-and-output structure.
We then explore the model extrapolation issue in the second stage using
different modeling methods. Considering the overfitting issue, we propose a new
moving window-based algorithm using a validation set in the first stage to
update the training data in both stages with two different moving window
processes.Experiments were conducted at three wind farms, and the results
demonstrate that the model with single input multiple output structure obtains
better forecasting accuracy compared to existing models. In addition, the ridge
regression method results in a better ensemble model that can further improve
forecasting accuracy compared to existing machine learning methods. Finally,
the proposed two-stage forecasting algorithm can generate more accurate and
stable results than existing algorithms.</span>

models to advance the understanding of brain disorders in neuroimaging studies.
To interpret the decision process of a trained classifier, existing techniques
typically rely on saliency maps to quantify the voxel-wise or feature-level
importance for classification through partial derivatives. Despite providing
some level of localization, these maps are not human-understandable from the
neuroscience perspective as they do not inform the specific meaning of the
alteration linked to the brain disorder. Inspired by the image-to-image
translation scheme, we propose to train simulator networks that can warp a
given image to inject or remove patterns of the disease. These networks are
trained such that the classifier produces consistently increased or decreased
prediction logits for the simulated images. Moreover, we propose to couple all
the simulators into a unified model based on conditional convolution. We
applied our approach to interpreting classifiers trained on a synthetic dataset
and two neuroimaging datasets to visualize the effect of the Alzheimer&#x27;s
disease and alcohol use disorder. Compared to the saliency maps generated by
baseline approaches, our simulations and visualizations based on the Jacobian
determinants of the warping field reveal meaningful and understandable patterns
related to the diseases.</span>

                                        <span>Researchers currently use a number of approaches to predict and substantiate
information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistical estimation
problems. A prominent approach is to characterize the limits of restricted
models of computation, which on the one hand yields strong computational lower
bounds for powerful classes of algorithms and on the other hand helps guide the
development of efficient algorithms. In this paper, we study two of the most
popular restricted computational models, the statistical query framework and
low-degree polynomials, in the context of high-dimensional hypothesis testing.
Our main result is that under mild conditions on the testing problem, the two
classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent in power. As corollaries, we
obtain new statistical query lower bounds for sparse PCA, tensor PCA and
several variants of the planted clique problem.</span>

and study the problem of regret minimization, which is central to the analysis
and design of optimal learning algorithms. We present logarithmic
problem-specific regret lower bounds that explicitly depend on the system
parameter (in contrast to previous minimax approaches) and thus, truly quantify
the fundamental limit of performance achievable by any learning algorithm.
Deterministic MDPs can be interpreted as graphs and analyzed in terms of their
cycles, a fact which we leverage in order to identify a class of deterministic
MDPs whose regret lower bound can be determined numerically. We further
exemplify this result on a deterministic line search problem, and a
deterministic MDP with state-dependent rewards, whose regret lower bounds we
can state explicitly. These bounds share similarities with the known
problem-specific bound of the multi-armed bandit problem and suggest that
navigation on a deterministic MDP need not have an effect on the performance of
a learning algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Training large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) currently requires a
significant amount of energy, leading to serious environmental impacts. One
promising approach to reduce the energy costs is representing DNNs with
low-precision numbers. While it is common to train DNNs with forward and
backward propagation in low-precision, training directly over low-precision
weights, without keeping a copy of weights in high-precision, still remains to
be an unsolved problem. This is due to complex interactions between learning
algorithms and low-precision number systems. To address this, we jointly design
a low-precision training framework involving a logarithmic number system (LNS)
and a multiplicative weight update training method, termed LNS-Madam. LNS has a
high dynamic range even in a low-bitwidth setting, leading to high energy
efficiency and making it relevant for on-board training in energy-constrained
edge devices. We design LNS to have the flexibility of choosing different bases
for weights and gradients, as they usually require different quantization gaps
and dynamic ranges during training. By drawing the connection between LNS and
multiplicative update, LNS-Madam ensures low quantization error during weight
update, leading to a stable convergence even if the bitwidth is limited.
Compared to using a fixed-point or floating-point number system and training
with popular learning algorithms such as SGD and Adam, our joint design with
LNS and LNS-Madam optimizer achieves better accuracy while requiring smaller
bitwidth. Notably, with only 5-bit for gradients, the proposed training
framework achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision state-of-the-art
models such as ResNet-50 and BERT. After conducting energy estimations by
analyzing the math datapath units during training, the results show that our
design achieves over 60x energy reduction compared to FP32 on BERT models.</span>

equilibria in sequential games such as poker games. However, most regret-based
algorithms, including counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) and its
variants, rely on iterate averaging to achieve convergence. Inspired by recent
advances on last-iterate convergence of optimistic algorithms in zero-sum
normal-form games, we study this phenomenon in sequential games, and provide a
comprehensive study of last-iterate convergence for zero-sum extensive-form
games with perfect recall (EFGs), using various optimistic regret-minimization
algorithms over treeplexes. This includes algorithms using the vanilla entropy
or squared Euclidean norm regularizers, as well as their dilated versions which
admit more efficient implementation. In contrast to CFR, we show that all of
these algorithms enjoy last-iterate convergence, with some of them even
converging exponentially fast. We also provide experiments to further support
our theoretical results.</span>

                                        <span>In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel
arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is
represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts
an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two
novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:
factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to
build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs
for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to
complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the
performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing
the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we
explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like
out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation,
accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate
outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior. The project page is

architecture includes two recurrent networks (RNs) followed by a linear
predictor. In this manuscript we perform analysis of a corresponding algorithm
and show that the parameters of the RNs of the well trained predictive network
are not independent of each other. Their dependence can be used to
significantly improve the network effectiveness. The traditional seq2seq
algorithms require short term memory of a size proportional to the predicted
sequence length. This requirement is quite difficult to implement in a
neuroscience context. We present a novel memoryless algorithm for seq2seq
predictive networks and compare it to the traditional one in the context of
time series prediction. We show that the new algorithm is more robust and makes

data from many domains. We introduce a new method to identify topics in a
corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic
Modeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic
modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each.
We first identify a set of vectors (&quot;discourse atoms&quot;) that provide a sparse
representation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent
topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words;
one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate
our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death
incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify
225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical
aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured
variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and
recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias
of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then
compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female
versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of
reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a
flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.</span>

                                        <span>Normalizing flows are among the most popular paradigms in generative
modeling, especially for images, primarily because we can efficiently evaluate
the likelihood of a data point. This is desirable both for evaluating the fit
of a model, and for ease of training, as maximizing the likelihood can be done
by gradient descent. However, training normalizing flows comes with
difficulties as well: models which produce good samples typically need to be
extremely deep -- which comes with accompanying vanishing/exploding gradient
problems. A very related problem is that they are often poorly conditioned:
since they are parametrized as invertible maps from $\mathbb{R}^d \to
\mathbb{R}^d$, and typical training data like images intuitively is
lower-dimensional, the learned maps often have Jacobians that are close to
being singular.

In our paper, we tackle representational aspects around depth and
conditioning of normalizing flows: both for general invertible architectures,
and for a particular common architecture, affine couplings. We prove that
$\Theta(1)$ affine coupling layers suffice to exactly represent a permutation
or $1 \times 1$ convolution, as used in GLOW, showing that representationally
the choice of partition is not a bottleneck for depth. We also show that
shallow affine coupling networks are universal approximators in Wasserstein
distance if ill-conditioning is allowed, and experimentally investigate related
phenomena involving padding. Finally, we show a depth lower bound for general
flow architectures with few neurons per layer and bounded Lipschitz constant.</span>

                                        <span>In data systems, activities or events are continuously collected in the field
to trace their proper executions. Logging, which means recording sequences of
events, can be used for analyzing system failures and malfunctions, and
identifying the causes and locations of such issues. In our research we focus
on creating an Anomaly detection models for system logs. The task of anomaly
detection is identifying unexpected events in dataset, which differ from the
normal behavior. Anomaly detection models also assist in data systems analysis
tasks.

Modern systems may produce such a large amount of events monitoring every
individual event is not feasible. In such cases, the events are often
aggregated over a fixed period of time, reporting the number of times every
event has occurred in that time period. This aggregation facilitates scaling,
but requires a different approach for anomaly detection. In this research, we
present a thorough analysis of the aggregated data and the relationships
between aggregated events. Based on the initial phase of our research we
present graphs representations of our aggregated dataset, which represent the
different relationships between aggregated instances in the same context.

Using the graph representation, we propose Multiple-graphs autoencoder MGAE,
a novel convolutional graphs-autoencoder model which exploits the relationships
of the aggregated instances in our unique dataset. MGAE outperforms standard
graph-autoencoder models and the different experiments. With our novel MGAE we
present 60% decrease in reconstruction error in comparison to standard graph
autoencoder, which is expressed in reconstructing high-degree relationships.</span>

\citep{qiu2018multivariate,Jammalamadaka2019Predicting} as a generalized
version of many structural time series models, deals with inference and
prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one also has the choice
of using a different candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each
target series. The MBSTS model has wide applications and is ideal for feature
selection, time series forecasting, nowcasting, inferring causal impact, and
others. This paper demonstrates how to use the R package \pkg{mbsts} for MBSTS
modeling, establishing a bridge between user-friendly and developer-friendly
functions in package and the corresponding methodology. A simulated dataset and

fuels the demand for automated condition monitoring strategies that can reduce
the operating cost and avoid unplanned downtime. Normal behaviour modelling has
been introduced to detect anomalous deviations from normal operation based on
the turbine&#x27;s SCADA data. A growing number of machine learning models of the
normal behaviour of turbine subsystems are being developed by wind farm
managers to this end. However, these models need to be kept track of, be
maintained and require frequent updates. This research explores multi-target
models as a new approach to capturing a wind turbine&#x27;s normal behaviour. We
present an overview of multi-target regression methods, motivate their
application and benefits in wind turbine condition monitoring, and assess their
performance in a wind farm case study. We find that multi-target models are
advantageous in comparison to single-target modelling in that they can reduce
the cost and effort of practical condition monitoring without compromising on
the accuracy. We also outline some areas of future research.</span>

discovery process. However, measuring progress in the field has been
challenging due to the lack of realistic retrospective benchmarks, and the
large cost of prospective validation. To close this gap, we propose a benchmark
based on docking, a popular computational method for assessing molecule binding
to a protein. Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are
scored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that popular
graph-based generative models fail to generate molecules with a high docking
score when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a
limitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design.
Finally, we propose a simplified version of the benchmark based on a simpler
scoring function, and show that the tested models are able to partially solve
it. We release the benchmark as an easy to use package available at
https://github.com/cieplinski-tobiasz/smina-docking-benchmark. We hope that our
benchmark will serve as a stepping stone towards the goal of automatically
generating promising drug candidates.</span>

rhythmic, tonal and timbral features of music. Formally, generating dance
conditioned on a piece of music can be expressed as a problem of modelling a
high-dimensional continuous motion signal, conditioned on an audio signal. In
this work we make two contributions to tackle this problem. First, we present a
novel probabilistic autoregressive architecture that models the distribution
over future poses with a normalizing flow conditioned on previous poses as well
as music context, using a multimodal transformer encoder. Second, we introduce
the currently largest 3D dance-motion dataset, obtained with a variety of
motion-capture technologies, and including both professional and casual
dancers. Using this dataset, we compare our new model against two baselines,
via objective metrics and a user study, and show that both the ability to model
a probability distribution, as well as being able to attend over a large motion

dance that matches the music.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian process regression is a widely-applied method for function
approximation and uncertainty quantification. The technique has gained
popularity recently in the machine learning community due to its robustness and
interpretability. The mathematical methods we discuss in this paper are an
extension of the Gaussian-process framework. We are proposing advanced kernel
designs that only allow for functions with certain desirable characteristics to
be elements of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that underlies all
kernel methods and serves as the sample space for Gaussian process regression.
These desirable characteristics reflect the underlying physics; two obvious
examples are symmetry and periodicity constraints. In addition, non-stationary
kernel designs can be defined in the same framework to yield flexible
multi-task Gaussian processes. We will show the impact of advanced kernel
designs on Gaussian processes using several synthetic and two scientific data
sets. The results show that including domain knowledge, communicated through
advanced kernel designs, has a significant impact on the accuracy and relevance
of the function approximation.</span>

offers the promise of freeing algorithm designers and programmers from
specifying how those choices should be made; in implementations, the choices
can be realized by optimization techniques and,increasingly, by
machine-learning methods. We study this approach from a programming-language
perspective. We define two small languages that support decision-making
abstractions: one with choices and rewards, and the other additionally with
probabilities. We give both operational and denotational semantics.

In the case of the second language we consider three denotational semantics,
with varying degrees of correlation between possible program values and
expected rewards. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of
standard constructs with optimization over spaces of possible execution
strategies. The denotational semantics, which are compositional rely on the
selection monad, to handle choice, augmented with an auxiliary monad to handle
other effects, such as rewards or probability.

We establish adequacy theorems that the two semantics coincide in all cases.
We also prove full abstraction at base types, with varying notions of
observation in the probabilistic case corresponding to the various degrees of
correlation. We present axioms for choice combined with rewards and
probability, establishing completeness at base types for the case of rewards
without probability.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we are concerned with differentially private {stochastic
gradient descent (SGD)} algorithms in the setting of stochastic convex
optimization (SCO). Most of the existing work requires the loss to be Lipschitz
continuous and strongly smooth, and the model parameter to be uniformly
bounded. However, these assumptions are restrictive as many popular losses
violate these conditions including the hinge loss for SVM, the absolute loss in
robust regression, and even the least square loss in an unbounded domain. We
significantly relax these restrictive assumptions and establish privacy and
generalization (utility) guarantees for private SGD algorithms using output and
gradient perturbations associated with non-smooth convex losses. Specifically,
the loss function is relaxed to have an $\alpha$-H\&quot;{o}lder continuous gradient
(referred to as $\alpha$-H\&quot;{o}lder smoothness) which instantiates the
Lipschitz continuity ($\alpha&#x3D;0$) and the strong smoothness ($\alpha&#x3D;1$). We
prove that noisy SGD with $\alpha$-H\&quot;older smooth losses using gradient
perturbation can guarantee $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) and
attain optimal excess population risk
$\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\sqrt{d\log(1/\delta)}}{n\epsilon}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$,
up to logarithmic terms, with the gradient complexity $ \mathcal{O}(
n^{2-\alpha\over 1+\alpha}+ n).$ This shows an important trade-off between
$\alpha$-H\&quot;older smoothness of the loss and the computational complexity for
private SGD with statistically optimal performance. In particular, our results
indicate that $\alpha$-H\&quot;older smoothness with $\alpha\ge {1/2}$ is sufficient
to guarantee $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP of noisy SGD algorithms while achieving
optimal excess risk with the linear gradient complexity $\mathcal{O}(n).$</span>

                                        <span>We consider a sequential setting in which a single dataset of individuals is
used to perform adaptively-chosen analyses, while ensuring that the
differential privacy loss of each participant does not exceed a pre-specified
privacy budget. The standard approach to this problem relies on bounding a
worst-case estimate of the privacy loss over all individuals and all possible
values of their data, for every single analysis. Yet, in many scenarios this
approach is overly conservative, especially for &quot;typical&quot; data points which
incur little privacy loss by participation in most of the analyses. In this
work, we give a method for tighter privacy loss accounting based on the value
of a personalized privacy loss estimate for each individual in each analysis.
To implement the accounting method we design a filter for R\&#x27;enyi differential
privacy. A filter is a tool that ensures that the privacy parameter of a
composed sequence of algorithms with adaptively-chosen privacy parameters does
not exceed a pre-specified budget. Our filter is simpler and tighter than the
known filter for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy by Rogers et al. We
apply our results to the analysis of noisy gradient descent and show that
personalized accounting can be practical, easy to implement, and can only make
the privacy-utility tradeoff tighter.</span>

technical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant
decision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a
higher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document
classification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for
classification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel
multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document
classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to
train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training
process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document
database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the
hierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that
the trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than
those using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.
The trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical
documents with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge
management in large technology companies and organizations.</span>

labeled input data, but DNNs sometimes fail to generalize to test data sampled
from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)
proves useful when no input labels are available, and distribution shifts are
observed in the target domain (TD). Experiments are performed on seismic images
of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and
Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological
classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. In
the present study, an improved deep neural network architecture named
EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images. We
specifically use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated
convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy &gt;84%
and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance
compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduced the CORAL
(Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain
adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections
fromF3 and Penobscot. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of
Penobscot with &gt;50% overall accuracy. Taken together, EAN-DDA has the potential
to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a new class of models that eschews
traditional depth in favor of finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear
layer. These models have been shown to achieve performance competitive with the
state-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they
are also slower, brittle to architectural choices, and introduce potential
instability to the model. In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for
DEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update
equations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this
regularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes
the fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales
well to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language
modeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for
the first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same
speed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as
ResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and
architectural simplicity of DEQs. Code is available at

                                        <span>It is well known that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, in which great efforts have been made to improve the
robustness. However, such examples are usually imperceptible to humans, and
thus their effect on biological neural circuits is largely unknown. This paper
will investigate the adversarial robustness in a simulated cerebellum, a
well-studied supervised learning system in computational neuroscience.
Specifically, we propose to study three unique characteristics revealed in the
cerebellum: (i) network width; (ii) long-term depression on the parallel
fiber-Purkinje cell synapses; (iii) sparse connectivity in the granule layer,
and hypothesize that they will be beneficial for improving robustness. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the adversarial
robustness in simulated cerebellum models.

The results are negative in the experimental phase -- no significant
improvements in robustness are discovered from the proposed three mechanisms.
Consequently, the cerebellum is expected to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples as the deep neural networks under batch training. Neuroscientists are
encouraged to fool the biological system in experiments with adversarial
attacks.</span>

inspection well-known to be slow, error-prone and operator-dependent. This
issue raises strong demand for automated real-time quality monitoring developed
from data-driven approaches thus alleviating from operator dependence and
adapting to various process uncertainties. Nonetheless, current approaches do
not take into account the streaming nature of sensory information while relying
heavily on hand-crafted features making them application-specific. This paper
proposes the online quality monitoring methodology developed from recently
developed deep learning algorithms for data streams, Neural Networks with
Dynamically Evolved Capacity (NADINE), namely NADINE++. It features the
integration of 1-D and 2-D convolutional layers to extract natural features of
time-series and visual data streams captured from sensors and cameras of the
injection molding machines from our own project. Real-time experiments have
been conducted where the online quality monitoring task is simulated on the fly
under the prequential test-then-train fashion - the prominent data stream
evaluation protocol. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques clearly
exhibits the advantage of NADINE++ with 4.68\% improvement on average for the
quality monitoring task in streaming environments. To support the reproducible
research initiative, codes, results of NADINE++ along with supplementary
materials and injection molding dataset are made available in

                                        <span>We consider the $k$-clustering problem with $\ell_p$-norm cost, which
includes $k$-median, $k$-means and $k$-center cost functions, under an
individual notion of fairness proposed by Jung et al. [2020]: given a set of
points $P$ of size $n$, a set of $k$ centers induces a fair clustering if for
every point $v\in P$, $v$ can find a center among its $n/k$ closest neighbors.
Recently, Mahabadi and Vakilian [2020] showed how to get a
$(p^{O(p)},7)$-bicriteria approximation for the problem of fair $k$-clustering
with $\ell_p$-norm cost: every point finds a center within distance at most $7$
times its distance to its $(n/k)$-th closest neighbor and the $\ell_p$-norm
cost of the solution is at most $p^{O(p)}$ times the cost of an optimal fair
solution. In this work, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we present an improved $(16^p
+\varepsilon,3)$-bicriteria approximation for the fair $k$-clustering with
$\ell_p$-norm cost. To achieve our guarantees, we extend the framework of
[Charikar et al., 2002, Swamy, 2016] and devise a $16^p$-approximation
algorithm for the facility location with $\ell_p$-norm cost under matroid
constraint which might be of an independent interest. Besides, our approach
suggests a reduction from our individually fair clustering to a clustering with
a group fairness requirement proposed by Kleindessner et al. [2019], which is
essentially the median matroid problem [Krishnaswamy et al., 2011].</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents novel reconfigurable architectures for reducing the
latency of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are used for detecting
gravitational waves. Gravitational interferometers such as the LIGO detectors
capture cosmic events such as black hole mergers which happen at unknown times
and of varying durations, producing time-series data. We have developed a new
architecture capable of accelerating RNN inference for analyzing time-series
data from LIGO detectors. This architecture is based on optimizing the
initiation intervals (II) in a multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
network, by identifying appropriate reuse factors for each layer. A
customizable template for this architecture has been designed, which enables
the generation of low-latency FPGA designs with efficient resource utilization
using high-level synthesis tools. The proposed approach has been evaluated
based on two LSTM models, targeting a ZYNQ 7045 FPGA and a U250 FPGA.
Experimental results show that with balanced II, the number of DSPs can be
reduced up to 42% while achieving the same IIs. When compared to other
FPGA-based LSTM designs, our design can achieve about 4.92 to 12.4 times lower
latency.</span>

                                        <span>Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will
likely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform
real-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful
framework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data
distributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such
as covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to
be independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were
introduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data
sources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such
a way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the
prediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing
across data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider
a conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being
dependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying
data-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism
to adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such
an approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods
since it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further
yields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training
instabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in
domain-invariant methods.</span>

                                        <span>In vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is prevalent to assign
the auxiliary task with a surrogate self-supervised loss so as to obtain more
semantic representations and improve sample efficiency. However, abundant
information in self-supervised auxiliary tasks has been disregarded, since the
representation learning part and the decision-making part are separated. To
sufficiently utilize information in the auxiliary task, we present a simple yet
effective idea to employ self-supervised loss as an intrinsic reward, called
Intrinsically Motivated Self-Supervised learning in Reinforcement learning
(IM-SSR). We formally show that the self-supervised loss can be decomposed as
exploration for novel states and robustness improvement from nuisance
elimination. IM-SSR can be effortlessly plugged into any reinforcement learning
with self-supervised auxiliary objectives with nearly no additional cost.
Combined with IM-SSR, the previous underlying algorithms achieve salient
improvements on both sample efficiency and generalization in various
vision-based robotics tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, especially when
the reward signal is sparse.</span>

                                        <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and
simulating problems across a wide range of disciplines. Recent advances in deep
learning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis.
However, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs,
pose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations.
Moreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via
penalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this
end, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning
architectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled
data. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory
network is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal
evolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized
PDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure
forcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are
further enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly
simulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been
assessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers&#x27; equations, the
$\lambda$-$\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and
compared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms. The numerical
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in the context
of solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability.</span>

                                        <span>This work considers predicting the relational structure of a hypergraph for a
given set of vertices, as common for applications in particle physics,
biological systems and other complex combinatorial problems. A problem arises
from the number of possible multi-way relationships, or hyperedges, scaling in
$\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ for a set of $n$ elements. Simply storing an indicator
tensor for all relationships is already intractable for moderately sized $n$,
prompting previous approaches to restrict the number of vertices a hyperedge
connects. Instead, we propose a recurrent hypergraph neural network that
predicts the incidence matrix by iteratively refining an initial guess of the
solution. We leverage the property that most hypergraphs of interest are
sparsely connected and reduce the memory requirement to $\mathcal{O}(nk)$,
where $k$ is the maximum number of positive edges, i.e., edges that actually
exist. In order to counteract the linearly growing memory cost from training a
lengthening sequence of refinement steps, we further propose an algorithm that
applies backpropagation through time on randomly sampled subsequences. We
empirically show that our method can match an increase in the intrinsic
complexity without a performance decrease and demonstrate superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art models.</span>

with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on

either extractive rationales (i.e., subsets of input features) or free-text
natural language explanations (NLEs) as abstractive justifications. While NLEs
can be more comprehensive than extractive rationales, machine-generated NLEs
have been shown to sometimes lack commonsense knowledge. Here, we show that
commonsense knowledge can act as a bridge between extractive rationales and
NLEs, rendering both types of explanations better. More precisely, we introduce
a unified framework, called RExC (Rationale-Inspired Explanations with
Commonsense), that (1) extracts rationales as a set of features responsible for
machine predictions, (2) expands the extractive rationales using available
commonsense resources, and (3) uses the expanded knowledge to generate natural
language explanations. Our framework surpasses by a large margin the previous
state-of-the-art in generating NLEs across five tasks in both natural language
processing and vision-language understanding, with human annotators
consistently rating the explanations generated by RExC to be more
comprehensive, grounded in commonsense, and overall preferred compared to

learning of arbitrary data, from tree-like structures and text to graphs.
Building on the success of deep learning with prototypes in Euclidean and
hyperspherical spaces, a few recent works have proposed hyperbolic prototypes
for classification. Such approaches enable effective learning in
low-dimensional output spaces and can exploit hierarchical relations amongst
classes, but require privileged information about class labels to position the
hyperbolic prototypes. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Busemann Learning.
The main idea behind our approach is to position prototypes on the ideal
boundary of the Poincare ball, which does not require prior label knowledge. To
be able to compute proximities to ideal prototypes, we introduce the penalised
Busemann loss. We provide theory supporting the use of ideal prototypes and the
proposed loss by proving its equivalence to logistic regression in the
one-dimensional case. Empirically, we show that our approach provides a natural
interpretation of classification confidence, while outperforming recent
hyperspherical and hyperbolic prototype approaches.</span>

                                        <span>As people spend up to 87% of their time indoors, intelligent Heating,
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for
maintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. Those HVAC
systems in modern smart buildings rely on real-time sensor readings, which in
practice often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to
malicious attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of
indoor environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the
increase of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been
proposed in the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop
accurate physical models for ensuring their performance and even more
challenging to address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a
novel learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which
includes three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature
proposals with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of
the proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying
reinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to
address the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks,
we propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of
building physical dynamics. Through extensive numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that the proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can
significantly reduce building temperature violations under a variety of sensor
fault patterns while maintaining energy efficiency.</span>

(MOAFL) framework, where multiple learning tasks share edge devices for data
collection and learning models under the coordination of a edge server (ES).
Specially, the model updates for all the tasks are transmitted and
superpositioned concurrently over a non-orthogonal uplink channel via
over-the-air computation, and the aggregation results of all the tasks are
reconstructed at the ES through an extended version of the turbo compressed
sensing algorithm. Both the convergence analysis and numerical results
demonstrate that the MOAFL framework can significantly reduce the uplink

                                        <span>Consider the geometric range space $(X, \mathcal{H}_d)$ where $X \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathcal{H}_d$ is the set of ranges defined by
$d$-dimensional halfspaces. In this setting we consider that $X$ is the
disjoint union of a red and blue set. For each halfspace $h \in \mathcal{H}_d$
define a function $\Phi(h)$ that measures the &quot;difference&quot; between the fraction
of red and fraction of blue points which fall in the range $h$. In this context
the maximum discrepancy problem is to find the $h^* &#x3D; \arg \max_{h \in (X,
\mathcal{H}_d)} \Phi(h)$. We aim to instead find an $\hat{h}$ such that
$\Phi(h^*) - \Phi(\hat{h}) \le \varepsilon$. This is the central problem in
linear classification for machine learning, in spatial scan statistics for
spatial anomaly detection, and shows up in many other areas. We provide a
solution for this problem in $O(|X| + (1/\varepsilon^d) \log^4
(1/\varepsilon))$ time, which improves polynomially over the previous best
solutions. For $d&#x3D;2$ we show that this is nearly tight through conditional
lower bounds. For different classes of $\Phi$ we can either provide a
$\Omega(|X|^{3/2 - o(1)})$ time lower bound for the exact solution with a
reduction to APSP, or an $\Omega(|X| + 1/\varepsilon^{2-o(1)})$ lower bound for
the approximate solution with a reduction to 3SUM.

A key technical result is a $\varepsilon$-approximate halfspace range
counting data structure of size $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ with $O(\log
(1/\varepsilon))$ query time, which we can build in $O(|X| + (1/\varepsilon^d)
\log^4 (1/\varepsilon))$ time.</span>

such as online advertising, recommendation systems, healthcare, etc. However,
most of the algorithms use flat feature vectors to represent context whereas,
in the real world, there is a varying number of objects and relations among
them to model in the context. For example, in a music recommendation system,
the user context contains what music they listen to, which artists create this
music, the artist albums, etc. Adding richer relational context representations
also introduces a much larger context space making exploration-exploitation
harder. To improve the efficiency of exploration-exploitation knowledge about
the context can be infused to guide the exploration-exploitation strategy.
Relational context representations allow a natural way for humans to specify
knowledge owing to their descriptive nature. We propose an adaptation of
Knowledge Infused Policy Gradients to the Contextual Bandit setting and a novel
Knowledge Infused Policy Gradients Upper Confidence Bound algorithm and perform
an experimental analysis of a simulated music recommendation dataset and
various real-life datasets where expert knowledge can drastically reduce the
total regret and where it cannot.</span>

robots in interactive 3D environments and complex physics-enabled scenarios. We
make comprehensive contributions to all levels of the embodied AI stack - data,
simulation, and benchmark tasks. Specifically, we present: (i) ReplicaCAD: an
artist-authored, annotated, reconfigurable 3D dataset of apartments (matching
real spaces) with articulated objects (e.g. cabinets and drawers that can
open/close); (ii) H2.0: a high-performance physics-enabled 3D simulator with
speeds exceeding 25,000 simulation steps per second (850x real-time) on an
8-GPU node, representing 100x speed-ups over prior work; and, (iii) Home
Assistant Benchmark (HAB): a suite of common tasks for assistive robots (tidy
the house, prepare groceries, set the table) that test a range of mobile
manipulation capabilities. These large-scale engineering contributions allow us
to systematically compare deep reinforcement learning (RL) at scale and
classical sense-plan-act (SPA) pipelines in long-horizon structured tasks, with
an emphasis on generalization to new objects, receptacles, and layouts. We find

when applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to real-world robotics
problems, where agents have an incomplete view of the world. We present graph
convolutional memory (GCM) for solving POMDPs using deep reinforcement
learning. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, GCM embeds
domain-specific priors into the memory recall process via a knowledge graph. By
encapsulating priors in the graph, GCM adapts to specific tasks but remains
applicable to any DRL task. Using graph convolutions, GCM extracts hierarchical
graph features, analogous to image features in a convolutional neural network
(CNN). We show GCM outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM), gated
transformers for reinforcement learning (GTrXL), and differentiable neural
computers (DNCs) on control, long-term non-sequential recall, and 3D navigation

are rarely used as learning models because their function class is considered
to be restricted. This work shows that when trained properly polynomial
functions can be strong learning models. Particularly this work constructs
polynomial feedforward neural networks using the product activation, a new
activation function constructed from multiplications. The new neural network is
a polynomial function and provides accurate control of its polynomial order. It
can be trained by standard training techniques such as batch normalization and
dropout. This new feedforward network covers several previous polynomial models
as special cases. Compared with common feedforward neural networks, the
polynomial feedforward network has closed-form calculations of a few

                                        <span>We study the problems of offline and online contextual optimization with
feedback information, where instead of observing the loss, we observe,
after-the-fact, the optimal action an oracle with full knowledge of the
objective function would have taken. We aim to minimize regret, which is
defined as the difference between our losses and the ones incurred by an
all-knowing oracle. In the offline setting, the decision-maker has information
available from past periods and needs to make one decision, while in the online
setting, the decision-maker optimizes decisions dynamically over time based a
new set of feasible actions and contextual functions in each period. For the
offline setting, we characterize the optimal minimax policy, establishing the
performance that can be achieved as a function of the underlying geometry of
the information induced by the data. In the online setting, we leverage this
geometric characterization to optimize the cumulative regret. We develop an
algorithm that yields the first regret bound for this problem that is
logarithmic in the time horizon.</span>

post-processed. I propose a novel member-by-member post-processing approach
with neural networks. I bridge ideas from ensemble data assimilation with
self-attention, resulting into the self-attentive ensemble transformer. Here,
interactions between ensemble members are represented as additive and dynamic
self-attentive part. As proof-of-concept, global ECMWF ensemble forecasts are
regressed to 2-metre-temperature fields from the ERA5 reanalysis. I demonstrate
that the ensemble transformer can calibrate the ensemble spread and extract
additional information from the ensemble. Furthermore, the ensemble transformer
directly outputs multivariate and spatially-coherent ensemble members.
Therefore, self-attention and the transformer technique can be a missing piece
for a member-by-member post-processing of ensemble data with neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>Broad learning system (BLS) has been proposed for a few years. It
demonstrates an effective learning capability for many classification and
regression problems. However, BLS and its improved versions are mainly used to
deal with unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised learning problems in a
single domain. As far as we know, a little attention is paid to the
cross-domain learning ability of BLS. Therefore, we introduce BLS into the
field of transfer learning and propose a novel algorithm called domain
adaptation broad learning system based on locally linear embedding (DABLS-LLE).
The proposed algorithm can learn a robust classification model by using a small
part of labeled data from the target domain and all labeled data from the
source domain. The proposed algorithm inherits the computational efficiency and
learning capability of BLS. Experiments on benchmark dataset
(Office-Caltech-10) verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results show
that our approach can get better classification accuracy with less running time
than many existing transfer learning approaches. It shows that our approach can
bring a new superiority for BLS.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work has made significant progress in helping users to automate single
data preparation steps, such as string-transformations and table-manipulation
operators (e.g., Join, GroupBy, Pivot, etc.). We in this work propose to
automate multiple such steps end-to-end, by synthesizing complex data pipelines
with both string transformations and table-manipulation operators. We propose a
novel &quot;by-target&quot; paradigm that allows users to easily specify the desired
pipeline, which is a significant departure from the traditional by-example
paradigm. Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json
files), and point us to a &quot;target table&quot; (e.g., an existing database table or
BI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would
schematically &quot;look like&quot;. While the problem is seemingly underspecified, our
unique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be
exploited to significantly constrain the space to make the problem tractable.
We develop an Auto-Pipeline system that learns to synthesize pipelines using
reinforcement learning and search. Experiments on large numbers of real
pipelines crawled from GitHub suggest that Auto-Pipeline can successfully
synthesize 60-70% of these complex pipelines (up to 10 steps) in 10-20 seconds
on average.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks given by
logical specifications. Recent approaches automatically generate a reward
function from a given specification and use a suitable reinforcement learning
algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward. These
approaches, however, scale poorly to complex tasks that require high-level
planning. In this work, we develop a compositional learning approach, called
DiRL, that interleaves high-level planning and reinforcement learning. First,
DiRL encodes the specification as an abstract graph; intuitively, vertices and
edges of the graph correspond to regions of the state space and simpler
sub-tasks, respectively. Our approach then incorporates reinforcement learning
to learn neural network policies for each edge (sub-task) within a
Dijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan in the graph. An
evaluation of the proposed approach on a set of challenging control benchmarks
with continuous state and action spaces demonstrates that it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

gain control over decisions in generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems
including deep learning neural networks. In contrast to adversarial data
modification, the attack mechanism we consider here involves alterations to the
AI system itself. Such a stealth attack could be conducted by a mischievous,
corrupt or disgruntled member of a software development team. It could also be
made by those wishing to exploit a &quot;democratization of AI&quot; agenda, where
network architectures and trained parameter sets are shared publicly. Building
on work by [Tyukin et al., International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,
2020], we develop a range of new implementable attack strategies with
accompanying analysis, showing that with high probability a stealth attack can
be made transparent, in the sense that system performance is unchanged on a
fixed validation set which is unknown to the attacker, while evoking any
desired output on a trigger input of interest. The attacker only needs to have
estimates of the size of the validation set and the spread of the AI&#x27;s relevant
latent space. In the case of deep learning neural networks, we show that a one
neuron attack is possible - a modification to the weights and bias associated
with a single neuron - revealing a vulnerability arising from
over-parameterization. We illustrate these concepts in a realistic setting.
Guided by the theory and computational results, we also propose strategies to
guard against stealth attacks.</span>

                                        <span>High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the primary procedure used to diagnose
esophageal motility disorders. Its interpretation and classification includes
an initial evaluation of swallow-level outcomes and then derivation of a
study-level diagnosis based on Chicago Classification (CC), using a tree-like
algorithm. This diagnostic approach on motility disordered using HRM was
mirrored using a multi-stage modeling framework developed using a combination
of various machine learning approaches. Specifically, the framework includes
deep-learning models at the swallow-level stage and feature-based machine
learning models at the study-level stage. In the swallow-level stage, three
models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to predict
swallow type, swallow pressurization, and integrated relaxation pressure (IRP).
At the study-level stage, model selection from families of the
expert-knowledge-based rule models, xgboost models and artificial neural
network(ANN) models were conducted, with the latter two model designed and
augmented with motivation from the export knowledge. A simple model-agnostic
strategy of model balancing motivated by Bayesian principles was utilized,
which gave rise to model averaging weighted by precision scores. The averaged
(blended) models and individual models were compared and evaluated, of which
the best performance on test dataset is 0.81 in top-1 prediction, 0.92 in top-2
predictions. This is the first artificial-intelligence-style model to
automatically predict CC diagnosis of HRM study from raw multi-swallow data.
Moreover, the proposed modeling framework could be easily extended to
multi-modal tasks, such as diagnosis of esophageal patients based on clinical
data from both HRM and functional luminal imaging probe panometry (FLIP).</span>

                                        <span>We propose POLAR, a \textbf{pol}ynomial \textbf{ar}ithmetic framework that
leverages polynomial overapproximations with interval remainders for
bounded-time reachability analysis of neural network-controlled systems
(NNCSs). Compared with existing arithmetic approaches that use standard Taylor
models, our framework uses a novel approach to iteratively overapproximate the
neuron output ranges layer-by-layer with a combination of Bernstein polynomial
interpolation for continuous activation functions and Taylor model arithmetic
for the other operations. This approach can overcome the main drawback in the
standard Taylor model arithmetic, i.e. its inability to handle functions that
cannot be well approximated by Taylor polynomials, and significantly improve
the accuracy and efficiency of reachable states computation for NNCSs. To
further tighten the overapproximation, our method keeps the Taylor model
remainders symbolic under the linear mappings when estimating the output range
of a neural network. We show that POLAR can be seamlessly integrated with
existing Taylor model flowpipe construction techniques, and demonstrate that
POLAR significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques on a
suite of benchmarks.</span>

but it is also creating issues related to the development of fair, accountable,
transparent, and ethical Artificial Intelligence. As the ML models are not
fully comprehensible yet, it is obvious that we still need humans to be part of
algorithmic decision-making processes. In this paper, we consider a ML
framework that may accelerate model learning and improve its interpretability
by incorporating human experts into the model learning loop. We propose a novel
human-in-the-loop ML framework aimed at dealing with learning problems that the
cost of data annotation is high and the lack of appropriate data to model the
association between the target tasks and the input features. With an
application to precision dosing, our experimental results show that the
approach can learn interpretable rules from data and may potentially lower
experts&#x27; workload by replacing data annotation with rule representation
editing. The approach may also help remove algorithmic bias by introducing
experts&#x27; feedback into the iterative model learning process.</span>

in applications with sparsely user-provided labels. Their unique relative
prediction setup offers opportunities for novel attacks, such as targeting
support sets required to categorise unseen test samples, which are not
available in other machine learning setups. In this work, we propose a
detection strategy to identify adversarial support sets, aimed at destroying
the understanding of a few-shot classifier for a certain class. We achieve this
by introducing the concept of self-similarity of a support set and by employing
filtering of supports. Our method is attack-agnostic, and we are the first to
explore adversarial detection for support sets of few-shot classifiers to the
best of our knowledge. Our evaluation of the miniImagenet (MI) and CUB datasets
exhibits good attack detection performance despite conceptual simplicity,
showing high AUROC scores. We show that self-similarity and filtering for
adversarial detection can be paired with other filtering functions,
constituting a generalisable concept.</span>

                                        <span>Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) algorithms have been traditionally
designed with the goal of learning accurate dynamics of the environment. This
introduces a mismatch between the objectives of model-learning and the overall
learning problem of finding an optimal policy. Value-aware model learning, an
alternative model-learning paradigm to maximum likelihood, proposes to inform
model-learning through the value function of the learnt policy. While this
paradigm is theoretically sound, it does not scale beyond toy settings. In this
work, we propose a novel value-aware objective that is an upper bound on the
absolute performance difference of a policy across two models. Further, we
propose a general purpose algorithm that modifies the standard MBRL pipeline --
enabling learning with value aware objectives. Our proposed objective, in
conjunction with this algorithm, is the first successful instantiation of
value-aware MBRL on challenging continuous control environments, outperforming
previous value-aware objectives and with competitive performance w.r.t.

variational quantum algorithm today. We train QAOA one layer at a time to
maximize overlap with an $n$ qubit target state. Doing so we discovered that
such training always saturates -- called \textit{training saturation} -- at
some depth $p^*$, meaning that past a certain depth, overlap can not be
improved by adding subsequent layers. We formulate necessary conditions for
saturation. Numerically, we find layerwise QAOA reaches its maximum overlap at
depth $p^*&#x3D;n$. The addition of coherent dephasing errors to training removes
saturation, recovering robustness to layerwise training. This study sheds new
light on the performance limitations and prospects of QAOA.</span>

patterns. Both sampling and inference are tractable for DPPs, a rare feature
among models with negative dependence that explains their popularity in machine
learning and spatial statistics. Parametric and nonparametric inference methods
have been proposed in the finite case, i.e. when the point patterns live in a
finite ground set. In the continuous case, only parametric methods have been
investigated, while nonparametric maximum likelihood for DPPs -- an
optimization problem over trace-class operators -- has remained an open
question. In this paper, we show that a restricted version of this maximum
likelihood (MLE) problem falls within the scope of a recent representer theorem
for nonnegative functions in an RKHS. This leads to a finite-dimensional
problem, with strong statistical ties to the original MLE. Moreover, we
propose, analyze, and demonstrate a fixed point algorithm to solve this
finite-dimensional problem. Finally, we also provide a controlled estimate of
the correlation kernel of the DPP, thus providing more interpretability.</span>

experiences it absorbs from previous episodes. While regularization techniques
such as LWF, SI, EWC have proven themselves as an effective avenue to overcome
this issue by constraining important parameters of old tasks from changing when
accepting new concepts, these approaches do not exploit common information of
each task which can be shared to existing neurons. As a result, they do not
scale well to large-scale problems since the parameter importance variables
quickly explode. An Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping (ISYANA) is proposed here to
underpin knowledge retention for continual learning. ISYANA combines
task-to-neuron relationship as well as concept-to-concept relationship such
that it prevents a neuron to embrace distinct concepts while merely accepting
relevant concept. Numerical study in the benchmark continual learning problems
has been carried out followed by comparison against prominent continual
learning algorithms. ISYANA exhibits competitive performance compared to state
of the arts. Codes of ISYANA is made available in

its logs. Our own study of a production debugging workflow confirms the
magnitude of this burden. This paper explores whether a machine-learning model
can assist developers in distributed systems debugging. We present Revelio, a
debugging assistant which takes user reports and system logs as input, and
outputs debugging queries that developers can use to find a bug&#x27;s root cause.
The key challenges lie in (1) combining inputs of different types (e.g.,
natural language reports and quantitative logs) and (2) generalizing to unseen
faults. Revelio addresses these by employing deep neural networks to uniformly
embed diverse input sources and potential queries into a high-dimensional
vector space. In addition, it exploits observations from production systems to
factorize query generation into two computationally and statistically simpler
learning tasks. To evaluate Revelio, we built a testbed with multiple
distributed applications and debugging tools. By injecting faults and training
on logs and reports from 800 Mechanical Turkers, we show that Revelio includes
the most helpful query in its predicted list of top-3 relevant queries 96% of
the time. Our developer study confirms the utility of Revelio.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of the outcome of an image
classifier on a given input datum. Deep neural networks commonly used for image
classification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.
As such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must
specify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and
interpreting &quot;confidence.&quot; To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,
which is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response
to data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the
given image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated
the given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other
than the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,
ensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative
adversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view
reconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior
obtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video. These
developments are only a small step towards assessing the reliability of deep
network classifiers in a manner that is compatible with safety-critical
applications.</span>

                                        <span>Variation Autoencoder (VAE) has become a powerful tool in modeling the
non-linear generative process of data from a low-dimensional latent space.
Recently, several studies have proposed to use VAE for unsupervised clustering
by using mixture models to capture the multi-modal structure of latent
representations. This strategy, however, is ineffective when there are outlier
data samples whose latent representations are meaningless, yet contaminating
the estimation of key major clusters in the latent space. This exact problem
arises in the context of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis, where
clustering major functional connectivity patterns is often hindered by heavy
noise of rs-fMRI and many minor clusters (rare connectivity patterns) of no
interest to analysis. In this paper we propose a novel generative process, in
which we use a Gaussian-mixture to model a few major clusters in the data, and
use a non-informative uniform distribution to capture the remaining data. We
embed this truncated Gaussian-Mixture model in a Variational AutoEncoder
framework to obtain a general joint clustering and outlier detection approach,
called tGM-VAE. We demonstrated the applicability of tGM-VAE on the MNIST
dataset and further validated it in the context of rs-fMRI connectivity
analysis.</span>

                                        <span>A basic requirement for a mathematical model is often that its solution
(output) shouldn&#x27;t change much if the model&#x27;s parameters (input) are perturbed.
This is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and
one would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect
values. Thus, it&#x27;s rarely enough to address an application by formulating a
model, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution
as the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,
&quot;good,&quot; and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of
optimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The
resulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable
solutions, which we referred to as &quot;bad&quot; models, and indicates better model
formulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of
problems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as
computationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal
circumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of
the actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be
intimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus
emerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the
tuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,
we&#x27;ll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad
perspective.</span>

to build a coherent statistical inference procedure on persistent diagrams. The

model to each data holder for local training and then aggregates committed
models globally to achieve privacy protection. However, both the dragger issue
of synchronous collaborative learning and the staleness issue of asynchronous
collaborative learning make collaborative learning inefficient in real-world
heterogeneous environments. We propose a novel and efficient collaborative
learning framework named AdaptCL, which generates an adaptive sub-model
dynamically from the global base model for each data holder, without any prior
information about worker capability. All workers (data holders) achieve
approximately identical update time as the fastest worker by equipping them
with capability-adapted pruned models. Thus the training process can be
dramatically accelerated. Besides, we tailor the efficient pruned rate learning
algorithm and pruning approach for AdaptCL. Meanwhile, AdaptCL provides a
mechanism for handling the trade-off between accuracy and time overhead and can
be combined with other techniques to accelerate training further. Empirical
results show that AdaptCL introduces little computing and communication
overhead. AdaptCL achieves time savings of more than 41\% on average and
improves accuracy in a low heterogeneous environment. In a highly heterogeneous
environment, AdaptCL achieves a training speedup of 6.2x with a slight loss of
accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>The mean squared error loss is widely used in many applications, including
auto-encoders, multi-target regression, and matrix factorization, to name a
few. Despite computational advantages due to its differentiability, it is not
robust to outliers. In contrast, l_p norms are known to be robust, but cannot
be optimized via, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, as they are
non-differentiable. We propose an algorithm inspired by so-called model-based
optimization (MBO) [35, 36], which replaces a non-convex objective with a
convex model function and alternates between optimizing the model function and
updating the solution. We apply this to robust regression, proposing SADM, a
stochastic variant of the Online Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(OADM) [50] to solve the inner optimization in MBO. We show that SADM converges
with the rate O(log T/T). Finally, we demonstrate experimentally (a) the
robustness of l_p norms to outliers and (b) the efficiency of our proposed
model-based algorithms in comparison with gradient methods on autoencoders and
multi-target regression.</span>

pointwise residuals. We derive rigorous bounds on the error, incurred by PINNs
in approximating the solutions of a large class of linear parabolic PDEs,
namely Kolmogorov equations that include the heat equation and Black-Scholes
equation of option pricing, as examples. We construct neural networks, whose
PINN residual (generalization error) can be made as small as desired. We also
prove that the total $L^2$-error can be bounded by the generalization error,
which in turn is bounded in terms of the training error, provided that a
sufficient number of randomly chosen training (collocation) points is used.
Moreover, we prove that the size of the PINNs and the number of training
samples only grow polynomially with the underlying dimension, enabling PINNs to
overcome the curse of dimensionality in this context. These results enable us
to provide a comprehensive error analysis for PINNs in approximating Kolmogorov
PDEs.</span>

large memory footprint makes them ill-suited for low-resource platforms such as
connected objects. We explored using reduced-precision floating-point
representations to lower memory consumption and evaluated its effect on
classification performance. We applied the Mondrian Forest implementation
provided by OrpailleCC, a C++ collection of data stream algorithms, to two
canonical datasets in human activity recognition: Recofit and Banos \emph{et
al}. Results show that the precision of floating-point values used by tree
nodes can be reduced from 64 bits to 8 bits with no significant difference in
F1 score. In some cases, reduced precision was shown to improve classification
performance, presumably due to its regularization effect. We conclude that
numerical precision is a relevant hyperparameter in the Mondrian Forest, and
that commonly-used double precision values may not be necessary for optimal
performance. Future work will evaluate the generalizability of these findings
to other data stream classifiers.</span>

morbidity. The prevention of DFU may be achieved by the identification of
patients at risk of DFU and the institution of preventative measures through
education and offloading. Several studies have reported that thermogram images
may help to detect an increase in plantar temperature prior to DFU. However,
the distribution of plantar temperature may be heterogeneous, making it
difficult to quantify and utilize to predict outcomes. We have compared a
machine learning-based scoring technique with feature selection and
optimization techniques and learning classifiers to several state-of-the-art
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on foot thermogram images and propose a
robust solution to identify the diabetic foot. A comparatively shallow CNN
model, MobilenetV2 achieved an F1 score of ~95% for a two-feet thermogram
image-based classification and the AdaBoost Classifier used 10 features and
achieved an F1 score of 97 %. A comparison of the inference time for the
best-performing networks confirmed that the proposed algorithm can be deployed

                                        <span>Supervised learning, while deployed in real-life scenarios, often encounters
instances of unknown classes. Conventional algorithms for training a supervised
learning model do not provide an option to detect such instances, so they
miss-classify such instances with 100% probability. Open Set Recognition (OSR)
and Non-Exhaustive Learning (NEL) are potential solutions to overcome this
problem. Most existing methods of OSR first classify members of existing
classes and then identify instances of new classes. However, many of the
existing methods of OSR only makes a binary decision, i.e., they only identify
the existence of the unknown class. Hence, such methods cannot distinguish test
instances belonging to incremental unseen classes. On the other hand, the
majority of NEL methods often make a parametric assumption over the data
distribution, which either fail to return good results, due to the reason that
real-life complex datasets may not follow a well-known data distribution. In
this paper, we propose a new online non-exhaustive learning model, namely,
Non-Exhaustive Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks (NE-GM-GAN) to
address these issues. Our proposed model synthesizes Gaussian mixture based
latent representation over a deep generative model, such as GAN, for
incremental detection of instances of emerging classes in the test data.
Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that
NE-GM-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting
instances of novel classes in streaming data.</span>

it requires expertise and experience to identify abnormalities. It is thus
crucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormalities in EEGs
related to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of
compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal patterns
and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired by a CNN
developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet (mEEGNet).
Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number of
electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormal patterns. The mEEGNet was
evaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and
childhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given
to paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and
interictal (nonseizure) durations. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected
abnormalities with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity
equivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of
parameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset
of absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is
the largest in the literature.</span>

                                        <span>Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge devices
while the training is done at server machines. However, retraining or
customizing a model is required at edge devices as the model is becoming
outdated due to environmental changes over time. To follow such a concept
drift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is recently proposed,
so that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to update their model. In
this case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices, the issue is
that only a limited amount of training data can be used for each edge device.
To address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or federated
learning, where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their
model by using those collected from the other devices. In this paper, as an
on-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme
Learning Machine) to sequentially train a model based on recent samples and
combine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection. We extend it for an
on-device federated learning so that edge devices can exchange their trained
results and update their model by using those collected from the other edge
devices. This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be repeatedly
applied to synchronize their model. Our approach is evaluated with anomaly
detection tasks generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity
dataset, and MNIST dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed on-device
federated learning can produce a merged model by integrating trained results
from multiple edge devices as accurately as traditional backpropagation based
neural networks and a traditional federated learning approach with lower
computation or communication cost.</span>

graph data. They have wide applications in chemistry and biology, such as
molecular property prediction, reaction prediction and drug-target interaction
prediction. Despite the interest, GNN-based modeling is challenging as it
requires graph data pre-processing and modeling in addition to programming and
deep learning. Here we present DGL-LifeSci, an open-source package for deep
learning on graphs in life science. DGL-LifeSci is a python toolkit based on
RDKit, PyTorch and Deep Graph Library (DGL). DGL-LifeSci allows GNN-based
modeling on custom datasets for molecular property prediction, reaction
prediction and molecule generation. With its command-line interfaces, users can
perform modeling without any background in programming and deep learning. We
test the command-line interfaces using standard benchmarks MoleculeNet, USPTO,
and ZINC. Compared with previous implementations, DGL-LifeSci achieves a speed
up by up to 6x. For modeling flexibility, DGL-LifeSci provides well-optimized
modules for various stages of the modeling pipeline. In addition, DGL-LifeSci

                                        <span>One of the most well-established applications of machine learning is in
deciding what content to show website visitors. When observation data comes
from high-velocity, user-generated data streams, machine learning methods
perform a balancing act between model complexity, training time, and
computational costs. Furthermore, when model freshness is critical, the
training of models becomes time-constrained. Parallelized batch offline
training, although horizontally scalable, is often not time-considerate or
cost-effective. In this paper, we propose Lambda Learner, a new framework for
training models by incremental updates in response to mini-batches from data
streams. We show that the resulting model of our framework closely estimates a
periodically updated model trained on offline data and outperforms it when
model updates are time-sensitive. We provide theoretical proof that the
incremental learning updates improve the loss-function over a stale batch
model. We present a large-scale deployment on the sponsored content platform
for a large social network, serving hundreds of millions of users across
different channels (e.g., desktop, mobile). We address challenges and
complexities from both algorithms and infrastructure perspectives, and
illustrate the system details for computation, storage, and streaming
production of training data.</span>

                                        <span>Dropout is a powerful and widely used technique to regularize the training of
deep neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a simple regularization
strategy upon dropout in model training, namely R-Drop, which forces the output
distributions of different sub models generated by dropout to be consistent
with each other. Specifically, for each training sample, R-Drop minimizes the
bidirectional KL-divergence between the output distributions of two sub models
sampled by dropout. Theoretical analysis reveals that R-Drop reduces the
freedom of the model parameters and complements dropout. Experiments on
$\bf{5}$ widely used deep learning tasks ($\bf{18}$ datasets in total),
including neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, language
understanding, language modeling, and image classification, show that R-Drop is
universally effective. In particular, it yields substantial improvements when
applied to fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models, e.g., ViT, RoBERTa-large,
and BART, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances with the vanilla
Transformer model on WMT14 English$\to$German translation ($\bf{30.91}$ BLEU)
and WMT14 English$\to$French translation ($\bf{43.95}$ BLEU), even surpassing
models trained with extra large-scale data and expert-designed advanced
variants of Transformer models. Our code is available at

high-dimensional inputs, such as images, to obtain models that are provably
robust against adversarial perturbations of the input. We extend this technique
to produce provable robustness for functions that map inputs into an arbitrary
metric space rather than discrete classes. Such functions are used in many
machine learning problems like image reconstruction, dimensionality reduction,
facial recognition, etc. Our robustness certificates guarantee that the change
in the output of the smoothed model as measured by the distance metric remains
small for any norm-bounded perturbation of the input. We can certify robustness
under a variety of different output metrics, such as total variation distance,
Jaccard distance, perceptual metrics, etc. In our experiments, we apply our
procedure to create certifiably robust models with disparate output spaces --
from sets to images -- and show that it yields meaningful certificates without
significantly degrading the performance of the base model. The code for our
experiments is available at: https://github.com/aounon/center-smoothing.</span>

capture a model&#x27;s predictive reasoning by identifying &quot;important&quot; pixels in an
input image. However, the development and adoption of saliency methods are
currently hindered by the lack of access to underlying model reasoning, which
prevents accurate method evaluation. In this work, we design a synthetic
evaluation framework, SMERF, that allows us to perform ground-truth-based
evaluation of saliency methods while controlling the underlying complexity of
model reasoning. Experimental evaluations via SMERF reveal significant
limitations in existing saliency methods, especially given the relative
simplicity of SMERF&#x27;s synthetic evaluation tasks. Moreover, the SMERF
benchmarking suite represents a useful tool in the development of new saliency
methods to potentially overcome these limitations.</span>

highlighted than ever. The task of transferring an input&#x27;s style to another is
accompanied by plenty of challenges (e.g., fluency and content preservation)
that need to be taken care of. In this research, we introduce PGST, a novel
polyglot text style transfer approach in the gender domain, composed of
different constitutive elements. In contrast to prior studies, it is feasible
to apply a style transfer method in multiple languages by fulfilling our
method&#x27;s predefined elements. We have proceeded with a pre-trained word
embedding for token replacement purposes, a character-based token classifier
for gender exchange purposes, and a beam search algorithm for extracting the
most fluent combination. Since different approaches are introduced in our
research, we determine a trade-off value for evaluating different models&#x27;
success in faking our gender identification model with transferred text. To
demonstrate our method&#x27;s multilingual applicability, we applied our method on
both English and Persian corpora and ended up defeating our proposed gender
identification model by 45.6% and 39.2%, respectively. While this research&#x27;s
focus is not limited to a specific language, our obtained evaluation results
are highly competitive in an analogy among English state of the art methods.</span>

sequential decision-making tasks, there has been little research on explaining
their predictions. In this work, we present TimeSHAP, a model-agnostic
recurrent explainer that builds upon KernelSHAP and extends it to the

pruning method that is shown to dramatically decrease both its computational
cost and the variance of its attributions. We use TimeSHAP to explain the
predictions of a real-world bank account takeover fraud detection RNN model,
and draw key insights from its explanations: i) the model identifies important
features and events aligned with what fraud analysts consider cues for account
takeover; ii) positive predicted sequences can be pruned to only 10% of the
original length, as older events have residual attribution values; iii) the
most recent input event of positive predictions only contributes on average to
41% of the model&#x27;s score; iv) notably high attribution to client&#x27;s age,
suggesting a potential discriminatory reasoning, later confirmed as higher
false positive rates for older clients.</span>

                                        <span>Learning efficiently a causal model of the environment is a key challenge of
model-based RL agents operating in POMDPs. We consider here a scenario where
the learning agent has the ability to collect online experiences through direct
interactions with the environment (interventional data), but has also access to
a large collection of offline experiences, obtained by observing another agent
interacting with the environment (observational data). A key ingredient, that
makes this situation non-trivial, is that we allow the observed agent to
interact with the environment based on hidden information, which is not
observed by the learning agent. We then ask the following questions: can the
online and offline experiences be safely combined for learning a causal model ?
And can we expect the offline experiences to improve the agent&#x27;s performances ?
To answer these questions, we import ideas from the well-established causal
framework of do-calculus, and we express model-based reinforcement learning as
a causal inference problem. Then, we propose a general yet simple methodology
for leveraging offline data during learning. In a nutshell, the method relies
on learning a latent-based causal transition model that explains both the
interventional and observational regimes, and then using the recovered latent
variable to infer the standard POMDP transition model via deconfounding. We
prove our method is correct and efficient in the sense that it attains better
generalization guarantees due to the offline data (in the asymptotic case), and
we illustrate its effectiveness empirically on synthetic toy problems. Our
contribution aims at bridging the gap between the fields of reinforcement
learning and causality.</span>

                                        <span>Most sequential recommendation models capture the features of consecutive
items in a user-item interaction history. Though effective, their
representation expressiveness is still hindered by the sparse learning signals.
As a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent
predictions. In this paper, we propose a model, \textbf{SSI}, to improve
sequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.
Precisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three
self-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona
consistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological
order and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the
model with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by
maximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.
Finally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of
consistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning
framework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and
transferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit
as well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the
flexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student
recommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively
outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.</span>

                                        <span>A major obstacle to achieving global convergence in distributed and federated
learning is the misalignment of gradients across clients, or mini-batches due
to heterogeneity and stochasticity of the distributed data. One way to
alleviate this problem is to encourage the alignment of gradients across
different clients throughout training. Our analysis reveals that this goal can
be accomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the
implicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as
improvements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in
SGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during
training, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches. To
obtain the generalization benefits of this regularization while increasing
parallelism, we propose a novel GradAlign algorithm that induces the same
implicit regularization while allowing the use of arbitrarily large batches in
each update. We experimentally validate the benefit of our algorithm in
different distributed and federated learning settings.</span>

                                        <span>Learning and reasoning over graphs is increasingly done by means of
probabilistic models, e.g. exponential random graph models, graph embedding
models, and graph neural networks. When graphs are modeling relations between
people, however, they will inevitably reflect biases, prejudices, and other
forms of inequity and inequality. An important challenge is thus to design
accurate graph modeling approaches while guaranteeing fairness according to the
specific notion of fairness that the problem requires. Yet, past work on the
topic remains scarce, is limited to debiasing specific graph modeling methods,
and often aims to ensure fairness in an indirect manner.

We propose a generic approach applicable to most probabilistic graph modeling
approaches. Specifically, we first define the class of fair graph models
corresponding to a chosen set of fairness criteria. Given this, we propose a
fairness regularizer defined as the KL-divergence between the graph model and
its I-projection onto the set of fair models. We demonstrate that using this
fairness regularizer in combination with existing graph modeling approaches
efficiently trades-off fairness with accuracy, whereas the state-of-the-art
models can only make this trade-off for the fairness criterion that they were
specifically designed for.</span>

                                        <span>Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role
in the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for
3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive
iso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial
data structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to
facilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive
subdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we
devise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex
decomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a
shape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of
planes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network
weights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.
The generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited
to represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net
is competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer
primitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more
generic decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as
well as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders. Code is
available at https://github.com/czq142857/BSP-NET-original.</span>

(DR), a frequent complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment
and blindness. Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides
real-time retinal images with resolution down to 2 $\mu m$ and thus allows
detection of the morphologies of individual MAs, a potential marker that might
dictate MA pathology and affect the progression of DR. In contrast to the
numerous automatic models developed for assessing the number of MAs on fundus
photographs, currently there is no high throughput image protocol available for
automatic analysis of AOSLO photographs. To address this urgency, we introduce
AOSLO-net, a deep neural network framework with customized training policies to
automatically segment MAs from AOSLO images. We evaluate the performance of
AOSLO-net using 87 DR AOSLO images and our results demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation model both in

make decisions over time under uncertainty. An enormous body of work has
accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book
provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each
chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained,
teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further
developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.

The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID
rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to
Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the
full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards
and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a
middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward
distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three
chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to
bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of
incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and
KL-divergence.

The chapters on &quot;bandits with similarity information&quot;, &quot;bandits with
knapsacks&quot; and &quot;bandits and agents&quot; can also be consumed as standalone surveys
on the respective topics.</span>

                                        <span>During the last decade or so, there has been an insurgence in the deep
learning community to solve health-related issues, particularly breast cancer.
Following the Camelyon-16 challenge in 2016, several researchers have dedicated
their time to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help radiologists
and other clinicians diagnose breast cancer. In particular, there has been an
emphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage
breast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into
this subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that
has proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer
correctly.

We found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an
explanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight
those pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then
chose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen,
using the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later
improved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically
comparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one
converged earlier in the experiments.

Following the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and
regions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is
represented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to
the diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final
classification. The most significant advantage of this algorithm is that it
performs exceptionally well with the Resnet-50 patch classifier architecture.</span>

                                        <span>Toxicity detection of text has been a popular NLP task in the recent years.
In SemEval-2021 Task-5 Toxic Spans Detection, the focus is on detecting toxic
spans within passages. Most state-of-the-art span detection approaches employ
various techniques, each of which can be broadly classified into Token
Classification or Span Prediction approaches. In our paper, we explore simple
versions of both of these approaches and their performance on the task.
Specifically, we use BERT-based models -- BERT, RoBERTa, and SpanBERT for both
approaches. We also combine these approaches and modify them to bring
improvements for Toxic Spans prediction. To this end, we investigate results on
four hybrid approaches -- Multi-Span, Span+Token, LSTM-CRF, and a combination
of predicted offsets using union/intersection. Additionally, we perform a
thorough ablative analysis and analyze our observed results. Our best
submission -- a combination of SpanBERT Span Predictor and RoBERTa Token
Classifier predictions -- achieves an F1 score of 0.6753 on the test set. Our
best post-eval F1 score is 0.6895 on intersection of predicted offsets from
top-3 RoBERTa Token Classification checkpoints. These approaches improve the
performance by 3% on average than those of the shared baseline models -- RNNSL
and SpaCy NER.</span>

by mobile users. However, this popular service can be abused by executing
illegal activities and influencing security risks. Nowadays, many automatic
machine learning (AutoML) tools exist which can help domain experts and lay
users to build high-quality ML models with little or no machine learning
knowledge. In this work, a classification performance comparison was conducted
between three automatic ML tools for SMS spam message filtering. These tools
are mljar-supervised AutoML, H2O AutoML, and Tree-based Pipeline Optimization
Tool (TPOT) AutoML. Experimental results showed that ensemble models achieved
the best classification performance. The Stacked Ensemble model, which was
built using H2O AutoML, achieved the best performance in terms of Log Loss
(0.8370), true positive (1088/1116), and true negative (281/287) metrics. There
is a 19.05\% improvement in Log Loss with respect to TPOT AutoML and 5.56\%
improvement with respect to mljar-supervised AutoML. The satisfactory filtering
performance achieved with AutoML tools provides a potential application for
AutoML tools to automatically determine the best ML model that can perform best

                                        <span>Attention mechanism has shown enormous potential for single image
super-resolution (SISR). However, existing works only proposed some attention
mechanism for a specific network. A universal attention mechanism for SISR,
which could further improve the performance of networks without attention and
provide a baseline for networks with attention, is still lacking. To fit this
gap, we propose a lightweight and efficient Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM),
which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial
Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. The information extraction mechanism of
ACAM and MSAM effectively filters redundant information, making the overall
structure of BAM very lightweight. Owing to the parallel structure, during the
gradient backpropagation process of BAM, ACAM and MSAM not only conduct
self-optimization, but also mutual optimization so as to generate more balanced
attention information. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we
applied it to 12 state-ofthe-art SISR networks. The results on 4 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks&#x27;
performance, and for those with attention, the substitution with BAM further
reduces the amount of parameters and increase the inference speed. Moreover,
ablation experiments were conducted to prove the minimalism of BAM.</span>

                                        <span>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a computational technique to estimate
the power loads&#x27; appliance-by-appliance from the whole consumption measured by
a single meter. In this paper, we propose a conditional density estimation
model, based on deep neural networks, that joins a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder with a Conditional Invertible Normalizing Flow model to estimate
the individual appliance&#x27;s power demand. The resulting model is called Prior
Flow Variational Autoencoder or, for simplicity PFVAE. Thus, instead of having
one model per appliance, the resulting model is responsible for estimating the
power demand, appliance-by-appliance, at once. We train and evaluate our
proposed model in a publicly available dataset composed of power demand
measures from a poultry feed factory located in Brazil. The proposed model&#x27;s
quality is evaluated by comparing the obtained normalized disaggregation error
(NDE) and signal aggregated error (SAE) with the previous work values on the
same dataset. Our proposal achieves highly competitive results, and for six of
the eight machines belonging to the dataset, we observe consistent improvements
that go from 28% up to 81% in NDE and from 27% up to 86% in SAE.</span>

intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we

real-world deployment.</span>

                                        <span>Kernel mean embeddings are a popular tool that consists in representing
probability measures by their infinite-dimensional mean embeddings in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space. When the kernel is characteristic, mean
embeddings can be used to define a distance between probability measures, known
as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). A well-known advantage of mean
embeddings and MMD is their low computational cost and low sample complexity.
However, kernel mean embeddings have had limited applications to problems that
consist in optimizing distributions, due to the difficulty of characterizing
which Hilbert space vectors correspond to a probability distribution. In this
note, we propose to leverage the kernel sums-of-squares parameterization of
positive functions of Marteau-Ferey et al. [2020] to fit distributions in the
MMD geometry. First, we show that when the kernel is characteristic,
distributions with a kernel sum-of-squares density are dense. Then, we provide
algorithms to optimize such distributions in the finite-sample setting, which
we illustrate in a density fitting numerical experiment.</span>

feed-forward artificial neural networks. The core of our results is the
construction of neural-network layers that efficiently perform tensor
contractions, and that use commonly adopted non-linear activation functions.
The resulting deep networks feature a number of edges that closely matches the
contraction complexity of the tensor networks to be approximated. In the
context of many-body quantum states, this result establishes that
neural-network states have strictly the same or higher expressive power than
practically usable variational tensor networks. As an example, we show that all
matrix product states can be efficiently written as neural-network states with
a number of edges polynomial in the bond dimension and depth logarithmic in the
system size. The opposite instead does not hold true, and our results imply
that there exist quantum states that are not efficiently expressible in terms
of matrix product states or practically usable PEPS, but that are instead
efficiently expressible with neural network states.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight
but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically
impair the network&#x27;s performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for
improving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially
perturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of
attacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of
previously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
adversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain
adaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),
aims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations
of the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are
both predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be
used to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
against a wide range of attack types and attack strengths.</span>

                                        <span>Fabrication process variations can significantly influence the performance
and yield of nano-scale electronic and photonic circuits. Stochastic spectral
methods have achieved great success in quantifying the impact of process
variations, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Recently,
low-rank tensor methods have been developed to mitigate this issue, but two
fundamental challenges remain open: how to automatically determine the tensor
rank and how to adaptively pick the informative simulation samples. This paper
proposes a novel tensor regression method to address these two challenges. We
use a $\ell_{q}/ \ell_{2}$ group-sparsity regularization to determine the
tensor rank. The resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved via
an alternating minimization solver. We also propose a two-stage adaptive
sampling method to reduce the simulation cost. Our method considers both
exploration and exploitation via the estimated Voronoi cell volume and
nonlinearity measurement respectively. The proposed model is verified with
synthetic and some realistic circuit benchmarks, on which our method can well
capture the uncertainty caused by 19 to 100 random variables with only 100 to
600 simulation samples.</span>

diagnosis of medical conditions such as depression, using a collection of a
person&#x27;s utterances. Depression is a serious medical illness that can have
adverse effects on how one feels, thinks, and acts, which can lead to emotional
and physical problems. Due to the sensitive nature of such data, privacy
measures need to be taken for handling and training models with such data. In
this work, we study the effects that the application of Differential Privacy
(DP) has, in both a centralized and a Federated Learning (FL) setup, on
training contextualized language models (BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT).
We offer insights on how to privately train NLP models and what architectures
and setups provide more desirable privacy utility trade-offs. We envisage this
work to be used in future healthcare and mental health studies to keep medical
history private. Therefore, we provide an open-source implementation of this

                                        <span>Swimming organisms can escape their predators by creating and harnessing
unsteady flow fields through their body motions. Stochastic optimization and
flow simulations have identified escape patterns that are consistent with those
observed in natural larval swimmers. However, these patterns have been limited
by the specification of a particular cost function and depend on a prescribed
functional form of the body motion. Here, we deploy reinforcement learning to
discover swimmer escape patterns for larval fish under energy constraints. The
identified patterns include the C-start mechanism, in addition to more
energetically efficient escapes. We find that maximizing distance with limited
energy requires swimming via short bursts of accelerating motion interlinked
with phases of gliding. The present, data efficient, reinforcement learning
algorithm results in an array of patterns that reveal practical flow
optimization principles for efficient swimming and the methodology can be
transferred to the control of aquatic robotic devices operating under energy
constraints.</span>

$\textit{in-distribution}$ [ID], in which the train and test tasks are sampled
$\textit{iid}$ from the same underlying task distribution, and
$\textit{out-of-distribution}$ [OOD], in which they are not. While most
meta-learning theory and some FSL applications follow the ID setting, we
identify that most existing few-shot classification benchmarks instead reflect
OOD evaluation, as they use disjoint sets of train (base) and test (novel)
classes for task generation. This discrepancy is problematic because -- as we
show on numerous benchmarks -- meta-learning methods that perform better on
existing OOD datasets may perform significantly worse in the ID setting. In
addition, in the OOD setting, even though current FSL benchmarks seem
befitting, our study highlights concerns in 1) reliably performing model
selection for a given meta-learning method, and 2) consistently comparing the
performance of different methods. To address these concerns, we provide
suggestions on how to construct FSL benchmarks to allow for ID evaluation as
well as more reliable OOD evaluation. Our work aims to inform the meta-learning
community about the importance and distinction of ID vs. OOD evaluation, as

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) methods are ubiquitous in wireless communication
systems and have proven powerful for applications including radio-frequency
(RF) fingerprinting, automatic modulation classification, and cognitive radio.
However, the large size of ML models can make them difficult to implement on
edge devices for latency-sensitive downstream tasks. In wireless communication
systems, ML data processing at a sub-millisecond scale will enable real-time
network monitoring to improve security and prevent infiltration. In addition,
compact and integratable hardware platforms which can implement ML models at
the chip scale will find much broader application to wireless communication
networks. Toward real-time wireless signal classification at the edge, we
propose a novel compact deep network that consists of a
photonic-hardware-inspired recurrent neural network model in combination with a
simplified convolutional classifier, and we demonstrate its application to the
identification of RF emitters by their random transmissions. With the proposed
model, we achieve 96.32% classification accuracy over a set of 30 identical
ZigBee devices when using 50 times fewer training parameters than an existing
state-of-the-art CNN classifier. Thanks to the large reduction in network size,
we demonstrate real-time RF fingerprinting with 0.219 ms latency using a
small-scale FPGA board, the PYNQ-Z1.</span>

optimization of queueing systems. In recent years, techniques from supervised
learning, bandit learning and reinforcement learning have been applied to
queueing systems supported by increasing role of information in decision
making. We present observations and new results that help rationalize the
application of these areas to queueing systems.

We prove that the MaxWeight and BackPressure policies are an application of
Blackwell&#x27;s Approachability Theorem. This connects queueing theoretic results
with adversarial learning. We then discuss the requirements of statistical
learning for service parameter estimation. As an example, we show how queue
size regret can be bounded when applying a perceptron algorithm to classify
service. Next, we discuss the role of state information in improved decision
making. Here we contrast the roles of epistemic information (information on
uncertain parameters) and aleatoric information (information on an uncertain
state). Finally we review recent advances in the theory of reinforcement
learning and queueing, as well as, provide discussion on current research
challenges.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training (AT) is currently one of the most successful methods to
obtain the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. However, the
phenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness starts to decrease
significantly during AT, has been problematic, not only making practitioners
consider a bag of tricks for a successful training, e.g., early stopping, but
also incurring a significant generalization gap in the robustness. In this
paper, we propose an effective regularization technique that prevents robust
overfitting by optimizing an auxiliary &#x27;consistency&#x27; regularization loss during
AT. Specifically, it forces the predictive distributions after attacking from
two different augmentations of the same instance to be similar with each other.
Our experimental results demonstrate that such a simple regularization
technique brings significant improvements in the test robust accuracy of a wide
range of AT methods. More remarkably, we also show that our method could
significantly help the model to generalize its robustness against unseen
adversaries, e.g., other types or larger perturbations compared to those used
during training. Code is available at

is robust to causal interventions on unobserved variables, when noisy proxies
of those variables are available. Our approach takes the form of a
regularization term that trades off between in-distribution performance and
robustness to interventions. Under the assumption of a linear structural causal
model, we show that a single proxy can be used to create estimators that are
prediction optimal under interventions of bounded strength. This strength
depends on the magnitude of the measurement noise in the proxy, which is, in
general, not identifiable. In the case of two proxy variables, we propose a
modified estimator that is prediction optimal under interventions up to a known
strength. We further show how to extend these estimators to scenarios where
additional information about the &quot;test time&quot; intervention is available during
training. We evaluate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and
using real data of hourly pollution levels across several cities in China.</span>

                                        <span>During online decision making in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), one needs to
conduct inference on the true mean reward of each arm based on data collected
so far at each step. However, since the arms are adaptively selected--thereby
yielding non-iid data--conducting inference accurately is not straightforward.
In particular, sample averaging, which is used in the family of UCB and
Thompson sampling (TS) algorithms, does not provide a good choice as it suffers
from bias and a lack of good statistical properties (e.g. asymptotic
normality). Our thesis in this paper is that more sophisticated inference
schemes that take into account the adaptive nature of the sequentially
collected data can unlock further performance gains, even though both UCB and
TS type algorithms are optimal in the worst case. In particular, we propose a
variant of TS-style algorithms--which we call doubly adaptive TS--that
leverages recent advances in causal inference and adaptively reweights the
terms of a doubly robust estimator on the true mean reward of each arm. Through
20 synthetic domain experiments and a semi-synthetic experiment based on data
from an A/B test of a web service, we demonstrate that using an adaptive
inferential scheme (while still retaining the exploration efficacy of TS)
provides clear benefits in online decision making: the proposed DATS algorithm
has superior empirical performance to existing baselines (UCB and TS) in terms
of regret and sample complexity in identifying the best arm. In addition, we
also provide a finite-time regret bound of doubly adaptive TS that matches (up
to log factors) those of UCB and TS algorithms, thereby establishing that its
improved practical benefits do not come at the expense of worst-case
suboptimality.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest
for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from
unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged
with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its
counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data
augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of
thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That
significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill
in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization
framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data
augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general
framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as
min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to
be in general aligned with previous &quot;best practices&quot; observed from handcrafted
tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we
propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route
output features through different projection heads corresponding to different
augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art
competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and
types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on
augmentation selection. We release the code at

their gripper and tactile sensing is often necessary in tasks that involve
contact-rich motion. In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in
touch feedback to guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement
learning tasks. Our approach, Touch-based Curiosity (ToC), learns what visible
objects interactions are supposed to &quot;feel&quot; like. We encourage exploration by
rewarding interactions where the expectation and the experience don&#x27;t match. In
our proposed method, an initial task-independent exploration phase is followed
by an on-task learning phase, in which the original interactions are relabeled
with on-task rewards. We test our approach on a range of touch-intensive robot
arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as part
of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we
demonstrate that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through
sparse reward and curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to
single-modality (touch- or vision-only) approaches as well as other

                                        <span>In representation learning on the graph-structured data, under heterophily
(or low homophily), many popular GNNs may fail to capture long-range
dependencies, which leads to their performance degradation. To solve the
above-mentioned issue, we propose a graph convolutional networks with structure
learning (GCN-SL), and furthermore, the proposed approach can be applied to
node classification. The proposed GCN-SL contains two improvements:
corresponding to node features and edges, respectively. In the aspect of node
features, we propose an efficient-spectral-clustering (ESC) and an ESC with
anchors (ESC-ANCH) algorithms to efficiently aggregate feature representations
from all similar nodes. In the aspect of edges, we build a re-connected
adjacency matrix by using a special data preprocessing technique and similarity
learning, and the re-connected adjacency matrix can be optimized directly along
with GCN-SL parameters. Considering that the original adjacency matrix may
provide misleading information for aggregation in GCN, especially the graphs
being with a low level of homophily. The proposed GCN-SL can aggregate feature
representations from nearby nodes via re-connected adjacency matrix and is
applied to graphs with various levels of homophily. Experimental results on a
wide range of benchmark datasets illustrate that the proposed GCN-SL
outperforms the stateof-the-art GNN counterparts.</span>

                                        <span>The widespread significance of Android IoT devices is due to its flexibility
and hardware support features which revolutionized the digital world by
introducing exciting applications almost in all walks of daily life, such as
healthcare, smart cities, smart environments, safety, remote sensing, and many
more. Such versatile applicability gives incentive for more malware attacks. In
this paper, we propose a framework which continuously aggregates multiple user
trained models on non-overlapping data into single model. Specifically for
malware detection task, (i) we propose a novel user (local) neural network
(LNN) which trains on local distribution and (ii) then to assure the model
authenticity and quality, we propose a novel smart contract which enable
aggregation process over blokchain platform. The LNN model analyzes various
static and dynamic features of both malware and benign whereas the smart
contract verifies the malicious applications both for uploading and downloading
processes in the network using stored aggregated features of local models. In
this way, the proposed model not only improves malware detection accuracy using
decentralized model network but also model efficacy with blockchain. We
evaluate our approach with three state-of-the-art models and performed deep
analyses of extracted features of the relative model.</span>

single neural network for developing a neural vocoder capable of generating
high-quality synthetic speech waveforms while retaining flexibility of the
source-filter model to control their voice characteristics. Our proposed
network called unified source-filter generative adversarial networks (uSFGAN)
is developed by factorizing quasi-periodic parallel WaveGAN (QPPWG), one of the
neural vocoders based on a single neural network, into a source excitation
generation network and a vocal tract resonance filtering network by
additionally implementing a regularization loss. Moreover, inspired by neural
source filter (NSF), only a sinusoidal waveform is additionally used as the
simplest clue to generate a periodic source excitation waveform while
minimizing the effect of approximations in the source filter model. The
experimental results demonstrate that uSFGAN outperforms conventional neural
vocoders, such as QPPWG and NSF in both speech quality and pitch

                                        <span>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely used for dimensionality
reduction and feature extraction. Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust
distance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or
outliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that
can not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing
methods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning
pattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex
and less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called
Self-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.
Notably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each
iteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into
training. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal
projection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is
presented to show the rationality of SPCA. Extensive experiments on popular
data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the state of-the-art
results considerably.</span>

                                        <span>Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal
dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual
Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data.
First, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet
correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a
novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by
designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn
discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module
built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to
maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while
minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have
been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest
that training a linear classifier on top of the features learned by our
proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally,
our proposed TS-TCC shows high efficiency in few-labeled data and transfer
learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at

processing large amounts of data for business and other applications, it would
be helpful to consider how these areas of research can complement each other.
To understand how they can be paired, we provide an overview of machine
learning foundations and development cycle. We then examine how conceptual
modeling can be applied to machine learning and propose a framework for
incorporating conceptual modeling into data science projects. The framework is
illustrated by applying it to a healthcare application. For the inverse
pairing, machine learning can impact conceptual modeling through text and rule
mining, as well as knowledge graphs. The pairing of conceptual modeling and

can enable the use of radiology report information for a variety of critical
healthcare applications. In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of
entities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a
novel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.
We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist
annotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579
entities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two
independent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology
reports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these
datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR
and CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference
dataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph
Benchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4
million relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908
relations) with mappings to associated chest radiographs. Our freely available
dataset can facilitate a wide range of research in medical natural language
processing, as well as computer vision and multi-modal learning when linked to
chest radiographs.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel multi-view training framework and CNN architecture for
combining information from multiple overlapping satellite images and noisy
training labels derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically label
buildings and roads across large geographic regions (100 km$^2$). Our approach
to multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class
IoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views
independently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of
our system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for
learning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference
with a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that
the benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of
the network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of
the GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per
scene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates
comparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first
training them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the
predicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our
IoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively
which are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that
are not completely automated.</span>

can be greatly improved by utilizing a useful set of skills. However, the
design of robot skills can often be intractable in real-world applications due
to the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise that it requires. In this
work, we introduce Skill Learning In Diversified Environments (SLIDE), a method
to discover generalizable skills via automated generation of a diverse set of
tasks. As opposed to prior work on unsupervised discovery of skills which
incentivizes the skills to produce different outcomes in the same environment,
our method pairs each skill with a unique task produced by a trainable task
generator. To encourage generalizable skills to emerge, our method trains each
skill to specialize in the paired task and maximizes the diversity of the
generated tasks. A task discriminator defined on the robot behaviors in the
generated tasks is jointly trained to estimate the evidence lower bound of the
diversity objective. The learned skills can then be composed in a hierarchical
reinforcement learning algorithm to solve unseen target tasks. We demonstrate
that the proposed method can effectively learn a variety of robot skills in two
tabletop manipulation domains. Our results suggest that the learned skills can
effectively improve the robot&#x27;s performance in various unseen target tasks
compared to existing reinforcement learning and skill learning methods.</span>

generalization of both the classical Mallows model of ranking distributions and
the extensively studied model of noisy pairwise comparisons. Our selective
Mallows model outputs a noisy ranking on any given subset of alternatives,
based on an underlying Mallows distribution. Assuming a sequence of subsets
where each pair of alternatives appears frequently enough, we obtain strong
asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of
learning the underlying complete ranking and the (identities and the) ranking
of the top-k alternatives from selective Mallows rankings. Moreover, building

inherent geometric 3D structure of our theory, we derive a 3D steerability
constraint for its atomic parts, the hypersphere neurons. Exploiting the
rotational equivariance, we show how the model parameters are fully steerable
at inference time. The proposed spherical filter banks enable to make
equivariant and, after online optimization, invariant class predictions for
known synthetic point sets in unknown orientations.</span>

                                        <span>Random forest (RF) is one of the most popular methods for estimating
regression functions. The local nature of the RF algorithm, based on intra-node
means and variances, is ideal when errors are i.i.d. For dependent error
processes like time series and spatial settings where data in all the nodes
will be correlated, operating locally ignores this dependence. Also, RF will
involve resampling of correlated data, violating the principles of bootstrap.
Theoretically, consistency of RF has been established for i.i.d. errors, but
little is known about the case of dependent errors.

We propose RF-GLS, a novel extension of RF for dependent error processes in
the same way Generalized Least Squares (GLS) fundamentally extends Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) for linear models under dependence. The key to this
extension is the equivalent representation of the local decision-making in a
regression tree as a global OLS optimization which is then replaced with a GLS
loss to create a GLS-style regression tree. This also synergistically addresses
the resampling issue, as the use of GLS loss amounts to resampling uncorrelated
contrasts (pre-whitened data) instead of the correlated data. For spatial
settings, RF-GLS can be used in conjunction with Gaussian Process correlated
errors to generate kriging predictions at new locations. RF becomes a special
case of RF-GLS with an identity working covariance matrix.

We establish consistency of RF-GLS under beta- (absolutely regular) mixing
error processes and show that this general result subsumes important cases like
autoregressive time series and spatial Matern Gaussian Processes. As a
byproduct, we also establish consistency of RF for beta-mixing processes, which
to our knowledge, is the first such result for RF under dependence.

We empirically demonstrate the improvement achieved by RF-GLS over RF for
both estimation and prediction under dependence.</span>

                                        <span>Estimating mutual information is an important statistics and machine learning
problem. To estimate the mutual information from data, a common practice is
preparing a set of paired samples $\{(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i)\}_{i&#x3D;1}^n
\stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$. However, in many
situations, it is difficult to obtain a large number of data pairs. To address
this problem, we propose the semi-supervised Squared-loss Mutual Information
(SMI) estimation method using a small number of paired samples and the
available unpaired ones. We first represent SMI through the density ratio
function, where the expectation is approximated by the samples from marginals
and its assignment parameters. The objective is formulated using the optimal
transport problem and quadratic programming. Then, we introduce the
Least-Squares Mutual Information with Sinkhorn (LSMI-Sinkhorn) algorithm for
efficient optimization. Through experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed method can estimate the SMI without a large number of paired samples.
Then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed LSMI-Sinkhorn algorithm on
various types of machine learning problems such as image matching and photo
album summarization. Code can be found at

matches the lower bound asymptotically. We demonstrate that contextual

                                        <span>Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse
representation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a
dictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to
state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,
classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternative
optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or
convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding
with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the
development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex
approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an
atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works
seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially
reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is
degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an
efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed
scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage
optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary
recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom
calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme
can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of
samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application
on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.</span>

                                        <span>Continuous-depth neural models, where the derivative of the model&#x27;s hidden
state is defined by a neural network, have enabled strong sequential data
processing capabilities. However, these models rely on advanced numerical
differential equation (DE) solvers resulting in a significant overhead both in
terms of computational cost and model complexity. In this paper, we present a
new family of models, termed Closed-form Continuous-depth (CfC) networks, that
are simple to describe and at least one order of magnitude faster while
exhibiting equally strong modeling abilities compared to their ODE-based
counterparts. The models are hereby derived from the analytical closed-form
solution of an expressive subset of time-continuous models, thus alleviating
the need for complex DE solvers all together. In our experimental evaluations,
we demonstrate that CfC networks outperform advanced, recurrent models over a
diverse set of time-series prediction tasks, including those with long-term
dependencies and irregularly sampled data. We believe our findings open new
opportunities to train and deploy rich, continuous neural models in
resource-constrained settings, which demand both performance and efficiency.</span>

detection algorithms to monitor their behavior over time. As a machine learning
algorithm learns from a continuous, possibly evolving, stream of data, it is
desirable and often critical to supplement it with a companion change detection
algorithm to facilitate its monitoring and control. We present a generic
score-based change detection method that can detect a change in any number of
components of a machine learning model trained via empirical risk minimization.
This proposed statistical hypothesis test can be readily implemented for such
models designed within a differentiable programming framework. We establish the

related videos generated online are increasing at an unprecedentedly fast pace.
To automate sports video editing/highlight generation process, a key task is to
precisely recognize and locate the events in the long untrimmed videos. In this
tech report, we present a two-stage paradigm to detect what and when events
happen in soccer broadcast videos. Specifically, we fine-tune multiple action
recognition models on soccer data to extract high-level semantic features, and
design a transformer based temporal detection module to locate the target
events. This approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance in both two
tasks, i.e., action spotting and replay grounding, in the SoccerNet-v2
Challenge, under CVPR 2021 ActivityNet workshop. Our soccer embedding features
are released at https://github.com/baidu-research/vidpress-sports. By sharing
these features with the broader community, we hope to accelerate the research
into soccer video understanding.</span>

                                        <span>In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via
computer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability
that contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can
significantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in
the ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be
described by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that
can be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged
objects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging
measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this
task has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To
establish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that
augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN
could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN
architectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized
medical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN
training strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or
multi-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive
Growing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the
proposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by
use of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging
system. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging
data are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.</span>

capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode
the location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,
which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,
for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the
position information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly
embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of
deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the
segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate
information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the
consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation
networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related
features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments
on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation
and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of
segmentation networks.</span>

                                        <span>Like many other domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), there are specific
tasks in the field of AI in Education (AIEd) for which labels are scarce and
expensive, such as predicting exam score or review correctness. A common way of
circumventing label-scarce problems is pre-training a model to learn
representations of the contents of learning items. However, such methods fail
to utilize the full range of student interaction data available and do not
model student learning behavior. To this end, we propose Assessment Modeling, a
class of fundamental pre-training tasks for general interactive educational
systems. An assessment is a feature of student-system interactions which can
serve as a pedagogical evaluation. Examples include the correctness and
timeliness of a student&#x27;s answer. Assessment Modeling is the prediction of
assessments conditioned on the surrounding context of interactions. Although it
is natural to pre-train on interactive features available in large amounts,
limiting the prediction targets to assessments focuses the tasks&#x27; relevance to
the label-scarce educational problems and reduces less-relevant noise. While
the effectiveness of different combinations of assessments is open for

tensor CUR decompositions for low multilinear rank tensors. We also present
theoretical error bounds of the tensor CUR approximations when (adversarial or

sufficient for tensor CUR approximations if the tensor has an incoherent

The study of CL for sequential patterns revolves around trained recurrent

Networks (ESNs), where the recurrent component is kept fixed. We provide the
first evaluation of catastrophic forgetting in ESNs and we highlight the

                                        <span>The important recent book by G. Schurz appreciates that the no-free-lunch
theorems (NFL) have major implications for the problem of (meta) induction.
Here I review the NFL theorems, emphasizing that they do not only concern the
case where there is a uniform prior -- they prove that there are &quot;as many
priors&quot; (loosely speaking) for which any induction algorithm $A$
out-generalizes some induction algorithm $B$ as vice-versa. Importantly though,
in addition to the NFL theorems, there are many \textit{free lunch} theorems.
In particular, the NFL theorems can only be used to compare the
\textit{marginal} expected performance of an induction algorithm $A$ with the
marginal expected performance of an induction algorithm $B$. There is a rich
set of free lunches which instead concern the statistical correlations among
the generalization errors of induction algorithms. As I describe, the
meta-induction algorithms that Schurz advocate as a &quot;solution to Hume&#x27;s
problem&quot; are just an example of such a free lunch based on correlations among
the generalization errors of induction algorithms. I end by pointing out that
the prior that Schurz advocates, which is uniform over bit frequencies rather
than bit patterns, is contradicted by thousands of experiments in statistical
physics and by the great success of the maximum entropy procedure in inductive
inference.</span>

                                        <span>In many important graph data processing applications the acquired information
includes both node features and observations of the graph topology. Graph
neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit both sources of evidence but
they do not optimally trade-off their utility and integrate them in a manner
that is also universal. Here, universality refers to independence on homophily
or heterophily graph assumptions. We address these issues by introducing a new
Generalized PageRank (GPR) GNN architecture that adaptively learns the GPR
weights so as to jointly optimize node feature and topological information
extraction, regardless of the extent to which the node labels are homophilic or
heterophilic. Learned GPR weights automatically adjust to the node label
pattern, irrelevant on the type of initialization, and thereby guarantee
excellent learning performance for label patterns that are usually hard to
handle. Furthermore, they allow one to avoid feature over-smoothing, a process
which renders feature information nondiscriminative, without requiring the
network to be shallow. Our accompanying theoretical analysis of the GPR-GNN
method is facilitated by novel synthetic benchmark datasets generated by the
so-called contextual stochastic block model. We also compare the performance of
our GNN architecture with that of several state-of-the-art GNNs on the problem
of node-classification, using well-known benchmark homophilic and heterophilic
datasets. The results demonstrate that GPR-GNN offers significant performance
improvement compared to existing techniques on both synthetic and benchmark
data.</span>

(conditionally quasi-randomly assigned instruments) since the algorithms make
decisions based only on observable input variables. We use this observation to
develop a treatment-effect estimator for a class of stochastic and
deterministic decision-making algorithms. Our estimator is shown to be
consistent and asymptotically normal for well-defined causal effects. A key
special case of our estimator is a multidimensional regression discontinuity
design. We apply our estimator to evaluate the effect of the Coronavirus Aid,

(KGs) have been applied to find answers to conjunctive queries (CQs) over
incomplete KGs. However, the current methods only focus on inductive reasoning,
i.e. answering CQs by predicting facts based on patterns learned from the data,
and lack the ability of deductive reasoning by applying external domain
knowledge. Such (expert or commonsense) domain knowledge is an invaluable
resource which can be used to advance machine intelligence. To address this
shortcoming, we introduce a neural-symbolic method for ontology-mediated CQ
answering over incomplete KGs that operates in the embedding space. More
specifically, we propose various data augmentation strategies to generate
training queries using query-rewriting based methods and then exploit a novel
loss function for training the model. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our training strategies and the new loss function, i.e., our
method significantly outperforms the baseline in the settings that require both

that has stemmed more so in recent times with an increase in demand for virtual
content delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All educational institutions,
workplaces, research centers, etc. are trying to bridge the gap of
communication during these socially distanced times with the use of online
content delivery. The trend now is to create presentations, and then
subsequently deliver the same using various virtual meeting platforms. The time
being spent in such creation of presentations and delivering is what we try to
reduce and eliminate through this paper which aims to use Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules to automate the
process of creating a slides-based presentation from a document, and then use
state-of-the-art voice cloning models to deliver the content in the desired
author&#x27;s voice. We consider a structured document such as a research paper to
be the content that has to be presented. The research paper is first summarized
using BERT summarization techniques and condensed into bullet points that go
into the slides. Tacotron inspired architecture with Encoder, Synthesizer, and
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder, is used to convey the
contents of the slides in the author&#x27;s voice (or any customized voice). Almost
all learning has now been shifted to online mode, and professionals are now
working from the comfort of their homes. Due to the current situation, teachers
and professionals have shifted to presentations to help them in imparting
information. In this paper, we aim to reduce the considerable amount of time
that is taken in creating a presentation by automating this process and
subsequently delivering this presentation in a customized voice, using a
content delivery mechanism that can clone any voice using a short audio clip.</span>

the LS strategy smooths the one-hot encoded training signal by distributing its
distribution mass over the non-ground truth classes. We extend this technique
by considering example pairs, coined PLS. PLS first creates midpoint samples by
averaging random sample pairs and then learns a smoothing distribution during
training for each of these midpoint samples, resulting in midpoints with high
uncertainty labels for training. We empirically show that PLS significantly
outperforms LS, achieving up to 30% of relative classification error reduction.
We also visualize that PLS produces very low winning softmax scores for both in
and out of distribution samples.</span>

autonomous driving development platform developed for self-driving vehicles. We
show that CondenseNeXt is remarkably efficient in terms of FLOPs, designed for
ARM-based embedded computing platforms with limited computational resources and

three benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 (4.79% top-1 error), CIFAR-100

                                        <span>We consider the problem of interpretable network representation learning for
samples of network-valued data. We propose the Principal Component Analysis for
Networks (PCAN) algorithm to identify statistically meaningful low-dimensional
representations of a network sample via subgraph count statistics. The PCAN
procedure provides an interpretable framework for which one can readily
visualize, explore, and formulate predictive models for network samples. We
furthermore introduce a fast sampling-based algorithm, sPCAN, which is
significantly more computationally efficient than its counterpart, but still
enjoys advantages of interpretability. We investigate the relationship between
these two methods and analyze their large-sample properties under the common
regime where the sample of networks is a collection of kernel-based random
graphs. We show that under this regime, the embeddings of the sPCAN method
enjoy a central limit theorem and moreover that the population level embeddings
of PCAN and sPCAN are equivalent. We assess PCAN&#x27;s ability to visualize,
cluster, and classify observations in network samples arising in nature,
including functional connectivity network samples and dynamic networks
describing the political co-voting habits of the U.S. Senate. Our analyses
reveal that our proposed algorithm provides informative and discriminatory
features describing the networks in each sample. The PCAN and sPCAN methods
build on the current literature of network representation learning and set the
stage for a new line of research in interpretable learning on network-valued
data. Publicly available software for the PCAN and sPCAN methods are available

                                        <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as
human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the
users&#x27; bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although
researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional
manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis
disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method
to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as
personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically
dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an
attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the
tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative
knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a
dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,
reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine
that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.
Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based
algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the
prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis
results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the
proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the
adaptive tree.</span>

                                        <span>Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low
power magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power
fluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the
fluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and
effectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more
prone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise
measurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.
Moreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower
but still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a
shielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,
it can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents
algorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.
To improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms
that employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired
and well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support
vector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network
architecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based
method. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is
generated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by
comparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of
the machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly
emphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural
network can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding
receiver operating characteristic curves.</span>

for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Concretely, this network contains
two parts that separately named spatial graph reasoning subnetwork (SAGRN) and
spectral graph reasoning subnetwork (SEGRN) to capture the spatial and spectral
graph contexts, respectively. Different from the previous approaches
implementing superpixel segmentation on the original image or attempting to

superpixel segmentation on intermediate features of the network to adaptively
produce the homogeneous regions to get the effective descriptors. Then, we
adopt a similar idea in spectral part that reasonably aggregating the channels
to generate spectral descriptors for spectral graph contexts capturing. All
graph reasoning procedures in SAGRN and SEGRN are achieved through graph
convolution. To guarantee the global perception ability of the proposed
methods, all adjacent matrices in graph reasoning are obtained with the help of
non-local self-attention mechanism. At last, by combining the extracted spatial

                                        <span>Content-independent watermarks and block-wise independency can be considered
as vulnerabilities in semi-fragile watermarking methods. In this paper to
achieve the objectives of semi-fragile watermarking techniques, a method is
proposed to not have the mentioned shortcomings. In the proposed method, the
watermark is generated by relying on image content and a key. Furthermore, the
embedding scheme causes the watermarked blocks to become dependent on each
other, using a key. In the embedding phase, the image is partitioned into
non-overlapping blocks. In order to detect and separate the different types of
attacks more precisely, the proposed method embeds three copies of each
watermark bit into LWT coefficients of each 4x4 block. In the authentication
phase, by voting between the extracted bits the error maps are created; these
maps indicate image authenticity and reveal the modified regions. Also, in
order to automate the authentication, the images are classified into four
categories using seven features. Classification accuracy in the experiments is
97.97 percent. It is noted that our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method is robust against JPEG compression and is competitive with a
state-of-the-art semi-fragile watermarking method, in terms of robustness and
semi-fragility.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as
human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the
users&#x27; bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although
researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional
manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis
disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method
to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as
personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically
dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an
attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the
tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative
knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a
dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,
reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine
that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.
Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based
algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the
prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis
results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the
proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the
adaptive tree.</span>

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)
action recognition. However, TAL poses a unique set of challenges. In this
paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the
best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly consider audio and
video modalities for supervised TAL. We experimentally show that our schemes
consistently improve performance for state of the art video-only TAL
approaches. Specifically, they help achieve new state of the art performance on
large-scale benchmark datasets - ActivityNet-1.3 (52.73 mAP@0.5) and THUMOS14
(57.18 mAP@0.5). Our experiments include ablations involving multiple fusion
schemes, modality combinations and TAL architectures. Our code, models and

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the text-to-audio grounding issue, namely,
grounding the segments of the sound event described by a natural language query
in the untrimmed audio. This is a newly proposed but challenging audio-language
task, since it requires to not only precisely localize all the on- and off-sets
of the desired segments in the audio, but to perform comprehensive acoustic and
linguistic understandings and reason the multimodal interactions between the
audio and query. To tackle those problems, the existing method treats the query
holistically as a single unit by a global query representation, which fails to
highlight the keywords that contain rich semantics. Besides, this method has
not fully exploited interactions between the query and audio. Moreover, since
the audio and queries are arbitrary and variable in length, many meaningless
parts of them are not filtered out in this method, which hinders the grounding
of the desired segments.

To this end, we propose a novel Query Graph with Cross-gating Attention
(QGCA) model, which models the comprehensive relations between the words in
query through a novel query graph. Besides, to capture the fine-grained
interactions between audio and query, a cross-modal attention module that
assigns higher weights to the keywords is introduced to generate the
snippet-specific query representations. Finally, we also design a cross-gating
module to emphasize the crucial parts as well as weaken the irrelevant ones in
the audio and query. We extensively evaluate the proposed QGCA model on the
public Audiogrounding dataset with significant improvements over several
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, further ablation study shows the consistent
effectiveness of different modules in the proposed QGCA model.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models 1) are
developed for synthetically-distorted images and often generalize poorly to
authentic ones; 2) heavily rely on human ratings, which are prohibitively
labor-expensive to collect. Here, we propose an $opinion$-$free$ BIQA method
that learns from synthetically-distorted images and multiple agents to assess
the perceptual quality of authentically-distorted ones captured in the wild
without relying on human labels. Specifically, we first assemble a large number
of image pairs from synthetically-distorted images and use a set of
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models to assign pseudo-binary
labels of each pair indicating which image has higher quality as the
supervisory signal. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
BIQA model to rank the perceptual quality, optimized for consistency with the
binary labels. Since there exists domain shift between the synthetically- and
authentically-distorted images, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) module
is introduced to alleviate this issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed $opinion$-$free$ BIQA model, yielding
state-of-the-art performance in terms of correlation with human opinion scores,
as well as gMAD competition. Codes will be made publicly available upon
acceptance.</span>

viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential
to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in
early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus
group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking
experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study
is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes
towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is
consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive
story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health
behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to
enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the
penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting
characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the
detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design
considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public
perception of health issues.</span>

continuous technological arms race between generating higher quality content,
transmitting larger file sizes and supporting network infrastructure. Adding to
this is the recent COVID-19 pandemic fueled surge in the use of video
conferencing tools. Since videos take up substantial bandwidth (~100 Kbps to
few Mbps), improved video compression can have a substantial impact on network
performance for live and pre-recorded content, providing broader access to
multimedia content worldwide. In this work, we present a novel video
compression pipeline, called Txt2Vid, which substantially reduces data
transmission rates by compressing webcam videos (&quot;talking-head videos&quot;) to a
text transcript. The text is transmitted and decoded into a realistic
reconstruction of the original video using recent advances in deep learning
based voice cloning and lip syncing models. Our generative pipeline achieves
two to three orders of magnitude reduction in the bitrate as compared to the
standard audio-video codecs (encoders-decoders), while maintaining equivalent
Quality-of-Experience based on a subjective evaluation by users (n&#x3D;242) in an
online study. The code for this work is available at

                                        <span>Cued Speech (CS) is a communication system for deaf people or hearing
impaired people, in which a speaker uses it to aid a lipreader in phonetic
level by clarifying potentially ambiguous mouth movements with hand shape and
positions. Feature extraction of multi-modal CS is a key step in CS
recognition. Recent supervised deep learning based methods suffer from noisy CS
data annotations especially for hand shape modality. In this work, we first
propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn the feature
representation of image without using labels. Secondly, a small amount of
manually annotated CS data are used to fine-tune the first module. Thirdly, we
present a module, which combines Bi-LSTM and self-attention networks to further
learn sequential features with temporal and contextual information. Besides, to
enlarge the volume and the diversity of the current limited CS datasets, we
build a new British English dataset containing 5 native CS speakers. Evaluation
results on both French and British English datasets show that our model
achieves over 90% accuracy in hand shape recognition. Significant improvements
of 8.75% (for French) and 10.09% (for British English) are achieved in CS
phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic chat summarization can help people quickly grasp important
information from numerous chat messages. Unlike conventional documents, chat
logs usually have fragmented and evolving topics. In addition, these logs
contain a quantity of elliptical and interrogative sentences, which make the
chat summarization highly context dependent. In this work, we propose a novel
unsupervised framework called RankAE to perform chat summarization without
employing manually labeled data. RankAE consists of a topic-oriented ranking
strategy that selects topic utterances according to centrality and diversity
simultaneously, as well as a denoising auto-encoder that is carefully designed
to generate succinct but context-informative summaries based on the selected
utterances. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a large-scale dataset
of chat logs from a customer service environment and build an annotated set
only for model evaluation. Experimental results show that RankAE significantly
outperforms other unsupervised methods and is able to generate high-quality
summaries in terms of relevance and topic coverage.</span>

                                        <span>Previous works on neural text-to-speech (TTS) have been addressed on limited
speed in training and inference time, robustness for difficult synthesis
conditions, expressiveness, and controllability. Although several approaches
resolve some limitations, there has been no attempt to solve all weaknesses at
once. In this paper, we propose STYLER, an expressive and controllable TTS
framework with high-speed and robust synthesis. Our novel audio-text aligning
method called Mel Calibrator and excluding autoregressive decoding enable rapid
training and inference and robust synthesis on unseen data. Also, disentangled
style factor modeling under supervision enlarges the controllability in
synthesizing process leading to expressive TTS. On top of it, a novel noise
modeling pipeline using domain adversarial training and Residual Decoding
empowers noise-robust style transfer, decomposing the noise without any
additional label. Various experiments demonstrate that STYLER is more effective
in speed and robustness than expressive TTS with autoregressive decoding and
more expressive and controllable than reading style non-autoregressive TTS.
Synthesis samples and experiment results are provided via our demo page, and
code is available publicly.</span>

                                        <span>Fake news travels at unprecedented speeds, reaches global audiences and puts
users and communities at great risk via social media platforms. Deep learning
based models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled
data on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade
on other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are
posed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events,
where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding
the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from
scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,
expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those
challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named
MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events
with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates
meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of
these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention
mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical
information and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted
on multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental
results show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen
events effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

by using dataset and function descriptions while significantly decreasing
computation time from minutes to milliseconds by using a zero-shot approach.
Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by
reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be
used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call
privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to
process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information
improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of
unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide
a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual
descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification
performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves
classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a
graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data
meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict
the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot
fashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a
supervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require
tens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations. We show that zero-shot AutoML reduces
running and prediction times from minutes to milliseconds, consistently across
datasets. By speeding up AutoML by orders of magnitude this work demonstrates
real-time AutoML.</span>

                                        <span>Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive
gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most
pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web.
A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by
starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this
assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as
biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial
gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To
facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP
benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that
domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of
biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board.
Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for
pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common
practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging
schemes in named entity recognition (NER). To help accelerate research in
biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and
task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our
BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding &amp; Reasoning
Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.</span>

context. We assess the ability of both static and contextualized models to
adequately represent different lexical-semantic relations, such as homonymy and
synonymy. To do so, we created a new multilingual dataset that allows us to
perform a controlled evaluation of several factors such as the impact of the
surrounding context or the overlap between words, conveying the same or
different senses. A systematic assessment on four scenarios shows that the best
monolingual models based on Transformers can adequately disambiguate homonyms
in context. However, as they rely heavily on context, these models fail at
representing words with different senses when occurring in similar sentences.
Experiments are performed in Galician, Portuguese, English, and Spanish, and
both the dataset (with more than 3,000 evaluation items) and new models are

                                        <span>Much recent effort has been invested in non-autoregressive neural machine
translation, which appears to be an efficient alternative to state-of-the-art
autoregressive machine translation on modern GPUs. In contrast to the latter,
where generation is sequential, the former allows generation to be parallelized
across target token positions. Some of the latest non-autoregressive models
have achieved impressive translation quality-speed tradeoffs compared to
autoregressive baselines. In this work, we reexamine this tradeoff and argue
that autoregressive baselines can be substantially sped up without loss in
accuracy. Specifically, we study autoregressive models with encoders and
decoders of varied depths. Our extensive experiments show that given a
sufficiently deep encoder, a single-layer autoregressive decoder can
substantially outperform strong non-autoregressive models with comparable
inference speed. We show that the speed disadvantage for autoregressive
baselines compared to non-autoregressive methods has been overestimated in
three aspects: suboptimal layer allocation, insufficient speed measurement, and
lack of knowledge distillation. Our results establish a new protocol for future
research toward fast, accurate machine translation. Our code is available at

which is to maximize inter-class variance and minimize intra-class variance.
Supervised metric learning can be categorized into entity-based learning and
proxy-based learning. Most of the existing metric learning objectives like
Contrastive, Triplet, Prototypical, GE2E, etc all belong to the former
division, the performance of which is either highly dependent on sample mining
strategy or restricted by insufficient label information in the mini-batch.
Proxy-based losses mitigate both shortcomings, however, fine-grained
connections among entities are either not or indirectly leveraged. This paper
proposes a Masked Proxy (MP) loss which directly incorporates both proxy-based
relationships and pair-based relationships. We further propose Multinomial
Masked Proxy (MMP) loss to leverage the hardness of speaker pairs. These
methods have been applied to evaluate on VoxCeleb test set and reach
state-of-the-art Equal Error Rate(EER).</span>

replacements are sampled from a generator trained with masked language
modeling. Despite the compelling performance, ELECTRA suffers from the
following two issues. First, there is no direct feedback loop from
discriminator to generator, which renders replacement sampling inefficient.
Second, the generator&#x27;s prediction tends to be over-confident along with
training, making replacements biased to correct tokens. In this paper, we
propose two methods to improve replacement sampling for ELECTRA pre-training.
Specifically, we augment sampling with a hardness prediction mechanism, so that
the generator can encourage the discriminator to learn what it has not
acquired. We also prove that efficient sampling reduces the training variance
of the discriminator. Moreover, we propose to use a focal loss for the
generator in order to relieve oversampling of correct tokens as replacements.
Experimental results show that our method improves ELECTRA pre-training on
various downstream tasks.</span>

data and keywords over the years. This searching and indexing works well when
user/reader already knows about that particular creative textual artefact or
document. This indexing and search hardly takes into account interest and
emotional makeup of readers and its mapping to books. When a person is looking
for a literary textual artefact, he/she might be looking for not only
information but also to seek the joy of reading. In case of literary artefacts,
progression of emotions across the key events could prove to be the key for
indexing and searching. In this paper, we establish clusters among literary
artefacts based on computational relationships among sentiment progressions
using intelligent text analysis. We have created a database of 1076 English
titles + 20 Marathi titles and also used database
this http URL with 16559 titles and their
summaries. We have proposed Sentiment Progression based Indexing for searching
and recommending books. This can be used to create personalized clusters of
book titles of interest to readers. The analysis clearly suggests better
searching and indexing when we are targeting book lovers looking for a

large amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has
become a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring
quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$
trillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in
comparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model
achieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.</span>

(NMT), the core of which lies in the encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by
the recent progress of large-scale pre-trained language models on machine
translation in a limited scenario, we firstly demonstrate that a single
language model (LM4MT) can achieve comparable performance with strong
encoder-decoder NMT models on standard machine translation benchmarks, using
the same training data and similar amount of model parameters. LM4MT can also
easily utilize source-side texts as additional supervision. Though modeling the
source- and target-language texts with the same mechanism, LM4MT can provide
unified representations for both source and target sentences, which can better
transfer knowledge across languages. Extensive experiments on pivot-based and
zero-shot translation tasks show that LM4MT can outperform the encoder-decoder
NMT model by a large margin.</span>

efficiency by automatically creating summaries for long spoken dialogues in
which customers and agents try to address issues about specific topics. In this
work, we focus on topic-oriented dialogue summarization, which generates highly
abstractive summaries that preserve the main ideas from dialogues. In spoken
dialogues, abundant dialogue noise and common semantics could obscure the
underlying informative content, making the general topic modeling approaches
difficult to apply. In addition, for customer service, role-specific
information matters and is an indispensable part of a summary. To effectively
perform topic modeling on dialogues and capture multi-role information, in this
work we propose a novel topic-augmented two-stage dialogue summarizer (TDS)
jointly with a saliency-aware neural topic model (SATM) for topic-oriented
summarization of customer service dialogues. Comprehensive studies on a
real-world Chinese customer service dataset demonstrated the superiority of our
method against several strong baselines.</span>

understanding (NLU) tasks, there is a gap between these pretrained encoders and
natural language generation (NLG). NLG tasks are often based on the
encoder-decoder framework, where the pretrained encoders can only benefit part
of it. To reduce this gap, we introduce DeltaLM, a pretrained multilingual
encoder-decoder model that regards the decoder as the task layer of
off-the-shelf pretrained encoders. Specifically, we augment the pretrained
multilingual encoder with a decoder and pre-train it in a self-supervised way.
To take advantage of both the large-scale monolingual data and bilingual data,
we adopt the span corruption and translation span corruption as the
pre-training tasks. Experiments show that DeltaLM outperforms various strong
baselines on both natural language generation and translation tasks, including
machine translation, abstractive text summarization, data-to-text, and question
generation.</span>

formalized as a &#x27;situation description system&#x27;: a probabilistic model which
takes utterance understanding to be the mental process of describing one or

insights from different types of generative models to capture the interplay of
local and global contexts and their joint influence upon the lexical

                                        <span>In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language
modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of
context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts
to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them
explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation
decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting
a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying
&#x27;conservation principle&#x27; makes relevance propagation unique: differently from
other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token
importance, but the proportion of each token&#x27;s influence. We extend LRP to the
Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates
the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We
analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of
prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data,
and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data
tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token
contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of
different nature.</span>

words, without apparent detriment to understanding. We offer a novel
explanation for skipping: readers optimize a tradeoff between performing a
language-related task and fixating as few words as possible. We propose a
neural architecture that combines an attention module (deciding whether to skip
words) and a task module (memorizing the input). We show that our model
predicts human skipping behavior, while also modeling reading times well, even
though it skips 40% of the input. A key prediction of our model is that
different reading tasks should result in different skipping behaviors. We
confirm this prediction in an eye-tracking experiment in which participants
answers questions about a text. We are able to capture these experimental
results using the our model, replacing the memorization module with a task
module that performs neural question answering.</span>

Often these topics are correlated or associated with locations from where these
Tweet posts are made. For example, restaurant owners may need to know where
their target customers eat with respect to the sentiment of the posts made
related to food, policy planners may need to analyze citizens&#x27; opinion on
relevant issues such as crime, safety, congestion, etc. with respect to
specific parts of the city, or county or state. As promising as this is, less
than $1\%$ of the crawled Tweet posts come with geolocation tags. That makes
accurate prediction of Tweet posts for the non geo-tagged tweets very critical
to analyze data in various domains. In this research, we utilized millions of
Twitter posts and end-users domain expertise to build a set of deep neural

predicts the geolocation of non geo-tagged Tweet posts at various level of

synthesis system is to synthesize natural and expressive speech from the output
layer of the neural network without much attention given to the hidden layers.
However, by learning useful latent representation, the system can be used for
many more practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the use of
quantized vectors to model the latent linguistic embedding and compare it with
the continuous counterpart. By enforcing different policies over the latent
spaces in the training, we are able to obtain a latent linguistic embedding
that takes on different properties while having a similar performance in terms
of quality and speaker similarity. Our experiments show that the voice cloning
system built with vector quantization has only a small degradation in terms of
perceptive evaluations, but has a discrete latent space that is useful for
reducing the representation bit-rate, which is desirable for data transferring,
or limiting the information leaking, which is important for speaker
anonymization and other tasks of that nature.</span>

                                        <span>Ambiguity is a characteristic of natural language, which makes expression
ideas flexible. However, in a domain that requires accurate statements, it
becomes a barrier. Specifically, a single word can have many meanings and
multiple words can have the same meaning. When translating a text into a
foreign language, the translator needs to determine the exact meaning of each
element in the original sentence to produce the correct translation sentence.
From that observation, in this paper, we propose ParaLaw Nets, a pretrained
model family using sentence-level cross-lingual information to reduce ambiguity
and increase the performance in legal text processing. This approach achieved
the best result in the Question Answering task of COLIEE-2021.</span>

has been seen as critical to recent successes in few-shot learning. In this
work, we show that finetuning LMs in the few-shot setting can considerably
reduce the need for prompt engineering. In fact, one can use null prompts,
prompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and
achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of
tasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream
task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced:
finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than
standard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters. All in all, we
recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust
to different prompts, and can be made nearly as efficient as using frozen LMs.</span>

                                        <span>Large pre-trained models have achieved great success in many natural language
processing tasks. However, when they are applied in specific domains, these
models suffer from domain shift and bring challenges in fine-tuning and online
serving for latency and capacity constraints. In this paper, we present a
general approach to developing small, fast and effective pre-trained models for
specific domains. This is achieved by adapting the off-the-shelf general
pre-trained models and performing task-agnostic knowledge distillation in
target domains. Specifically, we propose domain-specific vocabulary expansion
in the adaptation stage and employ corpus level occurrence probability to
choose the size of incremental vocabulary automatically. Then we systematically
explore different strategies to compress the large pre-trained models for
specific domains. We conduct our experiments in the biomedical and computer
science domain. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
better performance over the BERT BASE model in domain-specific tasks while 3.3x
smaller and 5.1x faster than BERT BASE. The code and pre-trained models are
available at https://aka.ms/adalm.</span>

                                        <span>This article introduces byteSteady -- a fast model for classification using
byte-level n-gram embeddings. byteSteady assumes that each input comes as a
sequence of bytes. A representation vector is produced using the averaged
embedding vectors of byte-level n-grams, with a pre-defined set of n. The
hashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors. This input
representation vector is then fed into a linear classifier. A straightforward
application of byteSteady is text classification. We also apply byteSteady to
one type of non-language data -- DNA sequences for gene classification. For
both problems we achieved competitive classification results against strong
baselines, suggesting that byteSteady can be applied to both language and
non-language data. Furthermore, we find that simple compression using Huffman
coding does not significantly impact the results, which offers an
accuracy-speed trade-off previously unexplored in machine learning.</span>

prominent case in point is the explosion of the biomedical literature on
COVID-19, which swelled to hundreds of thousands of papers in a matter of
months. In general, biomedical literature expands by two papers every minute,
totalling over a million new papers every year. Search in the biomedical realm,
and many other vertical domains is challenging due to the scarcity of direct
supervision from click logs. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a
promising direction to overcome the annotation bottleneck. We propose a general
approach for vertical search based on domain-specific pretraining and present a
case study for the biomedical domain. Despite being substantially simpler and
not using any relevance labels for training or development, our method performs
comparably or better than the best systems in the official TREC-COVID
evaluation, a COVID-related biomedical search competition. Using distributed
computing in modern cloud infrastructure, our system can scale to tens of

consistently exhibit known human social biases. Although many methods for
debiasing exist, almost all fixate on completely eliminating biased information
from the embeddings and often diminish training set size in the process. In
this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for debiasing GloVe word
embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) which works by incorporating explicit
information about training set bias rather than removing biased data outright.
Our method runs quickly and efficiently with the help of a fast bias gradient
approximation method from Brunet et al. (2019). As our approach is akin to the
notion of &#x27;source criticism&#x27; in the humanities, we term our method
Source-Critical GloVe (SC-GloVe). We show that SC-GloVe reduces the effect size

Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Despite all the notable advancements,
current KGQA systems only focus on answer generation techniques and not on
answer verbalization. However, in real-world scenarios (e.g., voice assistants
such as Alexa, Siri, etc.), users prefer verbalized answers instead of a
generated response. This paper addresses the task of answer verbalization for
(complex) question answering over knowledge graphs. In this context, we propose
a multi-task-based answer verbalization framework: VOGUE (Verbalization thrOuGh
mUlti-task lEarning). The VOGUE framework attempts to generate a verbalized
answer using a hybrid approach through a multi-task learning paradigm. Our
framework can generate results based on using questions and queries as inputs
concurrently. VOGUE comprises four modules that are trained simultaneously
through multi-task learning. We evaluate our framework on existing datasets for

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have amply demonstrated their prowess but estimating the
reliability of their predictions remains challenging. Deep Ensembles are widely
considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty
estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another
popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our
central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like
models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first
uses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the
second relies on a finite number of independent models.

To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of
randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a
fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to
change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the
overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal
configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to
implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the
cost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets,
CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</span>

                                        <span>Slimmable neural networks provide a flexible trade-off front between
prediction error and computational requirement (such as the number of
floating-point operations or FLOPs) with the same storage requirement as a
single model. They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying
models to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for
optimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing
slimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or
optimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby
leaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight
optimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint
optimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.
Our framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special
cases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a
practical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes
both the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing
methods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,
and objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering
FLOPs and memory footprint, respectively. Our results highlight the potential
of optimizing the channel counts for different layers jointly with the weights
for slimmable networks. Code available at https://github.com/cmu-enyac/Joslim.</span>

found their way into the image processing literature in the course of the last
decades, being used to construct robust and efficient denoising filters for
multivariate images such as colour images but also matrix-valued images. Based
on the similarities between image and geometric data as results of the sampling
of continuous physical quantities, it can be expected that the understanding of
multivariate median filters for images provides a starting point for the
development of shape processing techniques. This paper presents an overview of
multivariate median concepts relevant for image and shape processing. It
focusses on their mathematical principles and discusses important properties

                                        <span>Quantitative MR imaging is increasingly favoured for its richer information
content and standardised measures. However, computing quantitative parameter
maps, such as those encoding longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), apparent
transverse relaxation rate (R2*) or magnetisation-transfer saturation (MTsat),
involves inverting a highly non-linear function. Many methods for deriving
parameter maps assume perfect measurements and do not consider how noise is
propagated through the estimation procedure, resulting in needlessly noisy
maps. Instead, we propose a probabilistic generative (forward) model of the
entire dataset, which is formulated and inverted to jointly recover (log)
parameter maps with a well-defined probabilistic interpretation (e.g., maximum
likelihood or maximum a posteriori). The second order optimisation we propose
for model fitting achieves rapid and stable convergence thanks to a novel
approximate Hessian. We demonstrate the utility of our flexible framework in
the context of recovering more accurate maps from data acquired using the
popular multi-parameter mapping protocol. We also show how to incorporate a
joint total variation prior to further decrease the noise in the maps, noting
that the probabilistic formulation allows the uncertainty on the recovered
parameter maps to be estimated. Our implementation uses a PyTorch backend and
benefits from GPU acceleration. It is available at

                                        <span>Late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is commonly
used to visualize and quantify left atrial (LA) scars. The position and extent
of scars provide important information of the pathophysiology and progression
of atrial fibrillation (AF). Hence, LA scar segmentation and quantification
from LGE MRI can be useful in computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment
stratification of AF patients. Since manual delineation can be time-consuming
and subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, automating this computing
is highly desired, which nevertheless is still challenging and
under-researched.

This paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA
cavity, wall, scar and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE
MRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first
summarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review
the methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail, and summarize the
validation strategies applied in each task. Finally, the possible future
developments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical
applications of the aforementioned methods. The review shows that the research
into this topic is still in early stages. Although several methods have been
proposed, especially for LA segmentation, there is still large scope for
further algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high
variability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.</span>

this work, we improve the original Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVTv1) by adding
three improvement designs, which include (1) locally continuous features with
convolutions, (2) position encodings with zero paddings, and (3) linear
complexity attention layers with average pooling. With these simple
modifications, our PVTv2 significantly improves PVTv1 on classification,
detection, and segmentation. Moreover, PVTv2 achieves much better performance
than recent works, including Swin Transformer, under ImageNet-1K pre-training.

                                        <span>The recent research explosion around implicit neural representations, such as
NeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality
scene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one major
limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is
the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each
view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural
representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time
applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of
samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples
are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To
this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations
for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a
classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically
warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than
directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,
our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step
and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we
reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on
available ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent acceleration
methods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not require
additional memory for explicit caching or acceleration structures, and can
render interactively (20 frames per second) on a single GPU.</span>

vector machines with the nonparallel hyperplanes to two types of frameworks.
The first type constructs the hyperplanes separately. It solves a series of
small optimization problems to obtain a series of hyperplanes, but is hard to
measure the loss of each sample. The other type constructs all the hyperplanes
simultaneously, and it solves one big optimization problem with the ascertained
loss of each sample. We give the characteristics of each framework and compare
them carefully. In addition, based on the second framework, we construct a
max-min distance-based nonparallel support vector machine for multiclass
classification problem, called NSVM. It constructs hyperplanes with large
distance margin by solving an optimization problem. Experimental results on
benchmark data sets show the advantages of our NSVM.</span>

                                        <span>Reconstructing magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled data is a
challenging problem due to various artifacts introduced by the under-sampling
operation. Recent deep learning-based methods for MR image reconstruction
usually leverage a generic auto-encoder architecture which captures low-level
features at the initial layers and high-level features at the deeper layers.
Such networks focus much on global features which may not be optimal to
reconstruct the fully-sampled image. In this paper, we propose an
Over-and-Under Complete Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (OUCR), which
consists of an overcomplete and an undercomplete Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network(CRNN). The overcomplete branch gives special attention in learning
local structures by restraining the receptive field of the network. Combining
it with the undercomplete branch leads to a network which focuses more on
low-level features without losing out on the global structures. Extensive
experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
significant improvements over the compressed sensing and popular deep
learning-based methods with less number of trainable parameters.</span>

measurements remains a holy grail of imaging science. Deep learning methods
have shown promise in learning object priors or constraints to improve the
conditioning of an ill-posed imaging inverse problem. In this study, a
framework for estimating an object of interest that is semantically related to
a known prior image, is proposed. An optimization problem is formulated in the
disentangled latent space of a style-based generative model, and semantically
meaningful constraints are imposed using the disentangled latent representation
of the prior image. Stable recovery from incomplete measurements with the help
of a prior image is theoretically analyzed. Numerical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our approach as compared to related methods are
presented.</span>

                                        <span>In current clinical practice, noisy and artifact-ridden weekly cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) images are only used for patient setup during
radiotherapy. Treatment planning is done once at the beginning of the treatment
using high-quality planning CT (pCT) images and manual contours for
organs-at-risk (OARs) structures. If the quality of the weekly CBCT images can
be improved while simultaneously segmenting OAR structures, this can provide
critical information for adapting radiotherapy mid-treatment as well as for
deriving biomarkers for treatment response. Using a novel physics-based data
augmentation strategy, we synthesize a large dataset of perfectly/inherently
registered planning CT and synthetic-CBCT pairs for locally advanced lung
cancer patient cohort, which are then used in a multitask 3D deep learning
framework to simultaneously segment and translate real weekly CBCT images to
high-quality planning CT-like images. We compared the synthetic CT and OAR
segmentations generated by the model to real planning CT and manual OAR
segmentations and showed promising results. The real week 1 (baseline) CBCT
images which had an average MAE of 162.77 HU compared to pCT images are
translated to synthetic CT images that exhibit a drastically improved average
MAE of 29.31 HU and average structural similarity of 92% with the pCT images.
The average DICE scores of the 3D organs-at-risk segmentations are: lungs 0.96,
heart 0.88, spinal cord 0.83 and esophagus 0.66. This approach could allow
clinicians to adjust treatment plans using only the routine low-quality CBCT
images, potentially improving patient outcomes. Our code, data, and pre-trained
models will be made available via our physics-based data augmentation library,

                                        <span>Confounding bias is a crucial problem when applying machine learning to
practice, especially in clinical practice. We consider the problem of learning
representations independent to multiple biases. In literature, this is mostly
solved by purging the bias information from learned representations. We however
expect this strategy to harm the diversity of information in the
representation, and thus limiting its prospective usage (e.g., interpretation).
Therefore, we propose to mitigate the bias while keeping almost all information
in the latent representations, which enables us to observe and interpret them
as well. To achieve this, we project latent features onto a learned vector
direction, and enforce the independence between biases and projected features
rather than all learned features. To interpret the mapping between projected
features and input data, we propose projection-wise disentangling: a sampling
and reconstruction along the learned vector direction. The proposed method was
evaluated on the analysis of 3D facial shape and patient characteristics
(N&#x3D;5011). Experiments showed that this conceptually simple method achieved
state-of-the-art fair prediction performance and interpretability, showing its
great potential for clinical applications.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and their variants have been
widely used in large scale face recognition(FR) recently. Existing methods have
achieved good performance on many FR benchmarks. However, most of them suffer
from two major problems. First, these methods converge quite slowly since they
optimize the loss functions in a high-dimensional and sparse Gaussian Sphere.
Second, the high dimensionality of features, despite the powerful descriptive
ability, brings difficulty to the optimization, which may lead to a sub-optimal
local optimum. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet efficient
training mechanism called MultiFace, where we approximate the original
high-dimensional features by the ensemble of low-dimensional features. The
proposed mechanism is also generic and can be easily applied to many advanced
FR models. Moreover, it brings the benefits of good interpretability to FR
models via the clustering effect. In detail, the ensemble of these
low-dimensional features can capture complementary yet discriminative
information, which can increase the intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can
accelerate 2-3 times with the softmax loss and 1.2-1.5 times with Arcface or
Cosface, while achieving state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark
datasets. Especially, the significant improvements on large-scale
datasets(e.g., IJB and MageFace) demonstrate the flexibility of our new
training mechanism.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in whole slide imaging (WSI) technology have led to the
development of a myriad of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)
based diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive algorithms. Computational
Pathology (CPath) offers an integrated solution to utilize information embedded
in pathology WSIs beyond what we obtain through visual assessment. For
automated analysis of WSIs and validation of machine learning (ML) models,
annotations at the slide, tissue and cellular levels are required. The
annotation of important visual constructs in pathology images is an important
component of CPath projects. Improper annotations can result in algorithms
which are hard to interpret and can potentially produce inaccurate and
inconsistent results. Despite the crucial role of annotations in CPath
projects, there are no well-defined guidelines or best practices on how
annotations should be carried out. In this paper, we address this shortcoming
by presenting the experience and best practices acquired during the execution
of a large-scale annotation exercise involving a multidisciplinary team of
pathologists, ML experts and researchers as part of the Pathology image data
Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) consortium. We present a
real-world case study along with examples of different types of annotations,
diagnostic algorithm, annotation data dictionary and annotation constructs. The
analyses reported in this work highlight best practice recommendations that can
be used as annotation guidelines over the lifecycle of a CPath project.</span>

                                        <span>Document image classification remains a popular research area because it can
be commercialized in many enterprise applications across different industries.
Recent advancements in large pre-trained computer vision and language models
and graph neural networks has lent document image classification many tools.
However using large pre-trained models usually requires substantial computing
resources which could defeat the cost-saving advantages of automatic document
image classification. In the paper we propose an efficient document image
classification framework that uses graph convolution neural networks and
incorporates textual, visual and layout information of the document. We have
rigorously benchmarked our proposed algorithm against several state-of-art
vision and language models on both publicly available dataset and a real-life
insurance document classification dataset. Empirical results on both publicly
available and real-world data show that our methods achieve near SOTA
performance yet require much less computing resources and time for model
training and inference. This results in solutions than offer better cost
advantages, especially in scalable deployment for enterprise applications. The
results showed that our algorithm can achieve classification performance quite
close to SOTA. We also provide comprehensive comparisons of computing
resources, model sizes, train and inference time between our proposed methods
and baselines. In addition we delineate the cost per image using our method and
other baselines.</span>

Variational AutoEncoders (VAE). Our work is motivated by recent studies
empowering VAEs to reach state of the art generative results on complex image
datasets. These very deep VAE architectures, as well as VAEs using more complex
output distributions, highlight a tendency to haphazardly produce high training
gradients as well as NaN losses. The empirical fixes proposed to train them
despite their limitations are neither fully theoretically grounded nor
generally sufficient in practice. Building on this, we localize the source of
the problem at the interface between the model&#x27;s neural networks and their
output probabilistic distributions. We explain a common source of instability
stemming from an incautious formulation of the encoded Normal distribution&#x27;s
variance, and apply the same approach on other, less obvious sources. We show
that by implementing small changes to the way we parameterize the Normal
distributions on which they rely, VAEs can securely be trained.</span>

                                        <span>Generating high-fidelity talking head video by fitting with the input audio
sequence is a challenging problem that receives considerable attentions
recently. In this paper, we address this problem with the aid of neural scene
representation networks. Our method is completely different from existing
methods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D face
models to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically,
the feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicit
function to generate a dynamic neural radiance field, from which a
high-fidelity talking-head video corresponding to the audio signal is
synthesized using volume rendering. Another advantage of our framework is that
not only the head (with hair) region is synthesized as previous methods did,
but also the upper body is generated via two individual neural radiance fields.
Experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) produce
high-fidelity and natural results, and (2) support free adjustment of audio
signals, viewing directions, and background images.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper we undertake the task of text-based video moment retrieval from
a corpus of videos. To train the model, text-moment paired datasets were used
to learn the correct correspondences. In typical training methods, ground-truth
text-moment pairs are used as positive pairs, whereas other pairs are regarded
as negative pairs. However, aside from the ground-truth pairs, some text-moment
pairs should be regarded as positive. In this case, one text annotation can be
positive for many video moments. Conversely, one video moment can be
corresponded to many text annotations. Thus, there are many-to-many
correspondences between the text annotations and video moments. Based on these
correspondences, we can form potentially relevant pairs, which are not given as
ground truth yet are not negative; effectively incorporating such relevant
pairs into training can improve the retrieval performance. The text query
should describe what is happening in a video moment. Hence, different video
moments annotated with similar texts, which contain a similar action, are
likely to hold the similar action, thus these pairs can be considered as
potentially relevant pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel training method
that takes advantage of potentially relevant pairs, which are detected based on
linguistic analysis about text annotation. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets revealed that our method improves the retrieval performance both
quantitatively and qualitatively.</span>

                                        <span>The performance of image recognition like human pose detection, trained with
simulated images would usually get worse due to the divergence between real and
simulated data. To make the distribution of a simulated image close to that of
real one, there are several works applying GAN-based image-to-image
transformation methods, e.g., SimGAN and CycleGAN. However, these methods would
not be sensitive enough to the various change in pose and shape of subjects,
especially when the training data are imbalanced, e.g., some particular poses
and shapes are minor in the training data. To overcome this problem, we propose
to introduce the label information of subjects, e.g., pose and type of objects
in the training of CycleGAN, and lead it to obtain label-wise transforamtion
models. We evaluate our proposed method called Label-CycleGAN, through
experiments on the digit image transformation from SVHN to MNIST and the
surveillance camera image transformation from simulated to real images.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a category-level perception problem, where one is given 3D sensor
data picturing an object of a given category (e.g. a car), and has to
reconstruct the pose and shape of the object despite intra-class variability
(i.e. different car models have different shapes). We consider an active shape
model, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential
CAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard
formulation where pose and shape estimation are formulated as a non-convex
optimization. Our first contribution is to provide the first certifiably
optimal solver for pose and shape estimation. In particular, we show that
rotation estimation can be decoupled from the estimation of the object
translation and shape, and we demonstrate that (i) the optimal object rotation
can be computed via a tight (small-size) semidefinite relaxation, and (ii) the
translation and shape parameters can be computed in closed-form given the
rotation. Our second contribution is to add an outlier rejection layer to our
solver, hence making it robust to a large number of misdetections. Towards this
goal, we wrap our optimal solver in a robust estimation scheme based on
graduated non-convexity. To further enhance robustness to outliers, we also
develop the first graph-theoretic formulation to prune outliers in
category-level perception, which removes outliers via convex hull and maximum
clique computations; the resulting approach is robust to 70%-90% outliers. Our
third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing
an ablation study on a simulated dataset and on the PASCAL3D+ dataset, we
combine our solver with a deep-learned keypoint detector, and show that the
resulting approach improves over the state of the art in vehicle pose
estimation in the ApolloScape datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, bladder cancer has been significantly increased in terms of
incidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour
growth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
In this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis
and can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to
grade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical
techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded
Attention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into
different severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established
in the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully
unsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and
infiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our
system outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a
convolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the
latent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final
average accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported
class activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the
same patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior
annotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on
labelled data.</span>

                                        <span>Point cloud upsampling using deep learning has been paid various efforts in
the past few years. Recent supervised deep learning methods are restricted to
the size of training data and is limited in terms of covering all shapes of
point clouds. Besides, the acquisition of such amount of data is unrealistic,
and the network generally performs less powerful than expected on unseen
records. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to upsample point
clouds internally referred as &quot;Zero Shot&quot; Point Cloud Upsampling (ZSPU) at
holistic level. Our approach is solely based on the internal information
provided by a particular point cloud without patching in both self-training and
testing phases. This single-stream design significantly reduces the training
time of the upsampling task, by learning the relation between low-resolution
(LR) point clouds and their high (original) resolution (HR) counterparts. This
association will provide super-resolution (SR) outputs when original point
clouds are loaded as input. We demonstrate competitive performance on benchmark
point cloud datasets when compared to other upsampling methods. Furthermore,
ZSPU achieves superior qualitative results on shapes with complex local details
or high curvatures.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer
vision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with
self-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers
(ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and
have not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a
further step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision
tasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for
the optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a
new effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that
architectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads,
width, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to
cater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \textit{private}
class token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to
adapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling
probability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS
attains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures.
For example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves
$74.7\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\%$ superior than the current
baseline ViT architecture. Code is available at

                                        <span>Cross-modal retrieval aims to enable flexible retrieval experience by
combining multimedia data such as image, video, text, and audio. One core of
unsupervised approaches is to dig the correlations among different object
representations to complete satisfied retrieval performance without requiring
expensive labels. In this paper, we propose a Graph Pattern Loss based
Diversified Attention Network(GPLDAN) for unsupervised cross-modal retrieval to
deeply analyze correlations among representations. First, we propose a
diversified attention feature projector by considering the interaction between
different representations to generate multiple representations of an instance.
Then, we design a novel graph pattern loss to explore the correlations among
different representations, in this graph all possible distances between
different representations are considered. In addition, a modality classifier is
added to explicitly declare the corresponding modalities of features before
fusion and guide the network to enhance discrimination ability. We test GPLDAN
on four public datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art cross-modal
retrieval methods, the experimental results demonstrate the performance and
competitiveness of GPLDAN.</span>

                                        <span>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its
detection. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art studies focused on glaucoma
detection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for
glaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a
new OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning
algorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted
features related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an
innovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual
and attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The
proposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot
learning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm
is redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides
substantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced
glaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic
prototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via
Heidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a
categorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.
Besides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma
detection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation
maps are directly in line with the clinicians&#x27; opinion since the heatmaps
pointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.</span>

                                        <span>Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) aims to learn multi-modal representations
from image-text pairs and serves for downstream vision-language tasks in a
fine-tuning fashion. The dominant VLP models adopt a CNN-Transformer
architecture, which embeds images with a CNN, and then aligns images and text
with a Transformer. Visual relationship between visual contents plays an
important role in image understanding and is the basic for inter-modal
alignment learning. However, CNNs have limitations in visual relation learning
due to local receptive field&#x27;s weakness in modeling long-range dependencies.
Thus the two objectives of learning visual relation and inter-modal alignment
are encapsulated in the same Transformer network. Such design might restrict
the inter-modal alignment learning in the Transformer by ignoring the
specialized characteristic of each objective. To tackle this, we propose a
fully Transformer visual embedding for VLP to better learn visual relation and
further promote inter-modal alignment. Specifically, we propose a metric named
Inter-Modality Flow (IMF) to measure the interaction between vision and
language modalities (i.e., inter-modality). We also design a novel masking
optimization mechanism named Masked Feature Regression (MFR) in Transformer to
further promote the inter-modality learning. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study to explore the benefit of Transformer for visual feature
learning in VLP. We verify our method on a wide range of vision-language tasks,
including Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Entailment and Visual
Reasoning. Our approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art VLP
performance, but also shows benefits on the IMF metric.</span>

creation from monocular videos. Our approach extends neural radiance fields
(NeRF) to the dynamic scenes with human movements via introducing explicit
pose-guided deformation while learning the scene representation network. In
particular, we estimate the human pose for each frame and learn a constant
canonical space for the detailed human template, which enables natural shape
deformation from the observation space to the canonical space under the
explicit control of the pose parameters. To compensate for inaccurate pose
estimation, we introduce the pose refinement strategy that updates the initial
pose during the learning process, which not only helps to learn more accurate
human reconstruction but also accelerates the convergence. In experiments we
show that the proposed approach achieves 1) implicit human geometry and
appearance reconstruction with high-quality details, 2) photo-realistic
rendering of the human from arbitrary views, and 3) animation of the human with
arbitrary poses.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in image synthesis enables one to translate images by
learning the mapping between a source domain and a target domain. Existing
methods tend to learn the distributions by training a model on a variety of
datasets, with results evaluated largely in a subjective manner. Relatively few
works in this area, however, study the potential use of semantic image
translation methods for image recognition tasks. In this paper, we explore the
use of Single Image Texture Translation (SITT) for data augmentation. We first
propose a lightweight model for translating texture to images based on a single
input of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing. Based on SITT,
we then explore the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image
classification tasks. We find the proposed method is capable of translating
input data into a target domain, leading to consistent improved image
recognition performance. Finally, we examine how SITT and related image
translation methods can provide a basis for a data-efficient, augmentation
engineering approach to model training.</span>

autonomous driving systems. Safe, high speed driving needs larger detection
ranges, which are enabled by new LiDARs. These larger detection ranges require
more efficient and accurate detection models. Towards this goal, we propose
Range Sparse Net (RSN), a simple, efficient, and accurate 3D object detector in
order to tackle real time 3D object detection in this extended detection
regime. RSN predicts foreground points from range images and applies sparse
convolutions on the selected foreground points to detect objects. The
lightweight 2D convolutions on dense range images results in significantly
fewer selected foreground points, thus enabling the later sparse convolutions
in RSN to efficiently operate. Combining features from the range image further
enhance detection accuracy. RSN runs at more than 60 frames per second on a
150m x 150m detection region on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) while being more
accurate than previously published detectors. As of 11/2020, RSN is ranked
first in the WOD leaderboard based on the APH/LEVEL 1 metrics for LiDAR-based
pedestrian and vehicle detection, while being several times faster than
alternatives.</span>

                                        <span>The detection of nuclei and cells in histology images is of great value in
both clinical practice and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons such
as morphological variations of nuclei or cells make it a challenging task where
conventional object detection methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance in
many cases. A detection task consists of two sub-tasks, classification and
localization. Under the condition of dense object detection, classification is
a key to boost the detection performance. Considering this, we propose
similarity based region proposal networks (SRPN) for nuclei and cells detection
in histology images. In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as
embedding layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added
into the region proposal networks, enabling the networks to learn
discriminative features based on similarity learning. Features obtained by
similarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance
compared to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard
convolutional neural networks architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and
RetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ nuclei
detection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental
results show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior
performance on both tasks when compared to their counterparts. In particular,
the proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MoNuSeg benchmark
for nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods, and
on the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines. The

                                        <span>Recent studies have shown that neural network (NN) based image classifiers
are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to
security-sensitive image recognition task. Prior work has shown that JPEG
compression can combat the drop in classification accuracy on adversarial
examples to some extent. But, as the compression ratio increases, traditional
JPEG compression is insufficient to defend those attacks but can cause an
abrupt accuracy decline to the benign images. In this paper, with the aim of
fully filtering the adversarial perturbations, we firstly make modifications to
traditional JPEG compression algorithm which becomes more favorable for NN.
Specifically, based on an analysis of the frequency coefficient, we design a
NN-favored quantization table for compression. Considering compression as a
data augmentation strategy, we then combine our model-agnostic preprocess with
noisy training. We fine-tune the pre-trained model by training with images
encoded at different compression levels, thus generating multiple classifiers.
Finally, since lower (higher) compression ratio can remove both perturbations
and original features slightly (aggressively), we use these trained multiple
models for model ensemble. The majority vote of the ensemble of models is
adopted as final predictions. Experiments results show our method can improve
defense efficiency while maintaining original accuracy.</span>

it has mostly focused on synthesizing visually realistic images. In this paper,
motivated by multi-task learning of shareable feature representations, we
consider a novel problem of learning a shared generative model that is useful
across various visual perception tasks. Correspondingly, we propose a general
multi-task oriented generative modeling (MGM) framework, by coupling a
discriminative multi-task network with a generative network. While it is
challenging to synthesize both RGB images and pixel-level annotations in
multi-task scenarios, our framework enables us to use synthesized images paired
with only weak annotations (i.e., image-level scene labels) to facilitate
multiple visual tasks. Experimental evaluation on challenging multi-task
benchmarks, including NYUv2 and Taskonomy, demonstrates that our MGM framework
improves the performance of all the tasks by large margins, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-task approaches.</span>

for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent
canvas in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas.
Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior
distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable
&#x60;&#x60;what-to-draw&#x27;&#x27; per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves
the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in
the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a
Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used
in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to
pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show
that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like
DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models. Moreover,
we show that our model&#x27;s inherent compositionality and interpretability bring
significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing.

registration of non-rigid 3D point clouds. The proposed approach is data-driven
and adopts for the first time the transformer architecture in the registration
task. Our method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed
template with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation
cues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the
template properties to the input geometry. Alternatively, given a pair of
shapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa),
obtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both
contexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications
such as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show
that including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the
learning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can
train our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences
($10\sim20\%$ of the total points). The proposed model and the analysis that we
perform pave the way for future exploration of transformer-based architectures
for registration and matching applications. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods

algorithms based on deep neural networks reach performance levels that are
competitive with human medical experts. To alleviate the challenges of small
dataset sizes, these systems often rely on pretraining. In this work, we aim to
assess the broader implications of these approaches. For diabetic retinopathy
grading as exemplary use case, we compare the impact of different training
procedures including recently established self-supervised pretraining methods
based on contrastive learning. To this end, we investigate different aspects
such as quantitative performance, statistics of the learned feature
representations, interpretability and robustness to image distortions. Our
results indicate that models initialized from ImageNet pretraining report a
significant increase in performance, generalization and robustness to image
distortions. In particular, self-supervised models show further benefits to
supervised models. Self-supervised models with initialization from ImageNet
pretraining not only report higher performance, they also reduce overfitting to
large lesions along with improvements in taking into account minute lesions
indicative of the progression of the disease. Understanding the effects of
pretraining in a broader sense that goes beyond simple performance comparisons
is of crucial importance for the broader medical imaging community beyond the

                                        <span>3D object detection is vital for many robotics applications. For tasks where
a 2D perspective range image exists, we propose to learn a 3D representation
directly from this range image view. To this end, we designed a 2D
convolutional network architecture that carries the 3D spherical coordinates of
each pixel throughout the network. Its layers can consume any arbitrary
convolution kernel in place of the default inner product kernel and exploit the
underlying local geometry around each pixel. We outline four such kernels: a
dense kernel according to the bag-of-words paradigm, and three graph kernels
inspired by recent graph neural network advances: the Transformer, the
PointNet, and the Edge Convolution. We also explore cross-modality fusion with
the camera image, facilitated by operating in the perspective range image view.
Our method performs competitively on the Waymo Open Dataset and improves the
state-of-the-art AP for pedestrian detection from 69.7% to 75.5%. It is also
efficient in that our smallest model, which still outperforms the popular
PointPillars in quality, requires 180 times fewer FLOPS and model parameters</span>

                                        <span>Semantic image synthesis is a process for generating photorealistic images
from a single semantic mask. To enrich the diversity of multimodal image
synthesis, previous methods have controlled the global appearance of an output
image by learning a single latent space. However, a single latent code is often
insufficient for capturing various object styles because object appearance
depends on multiple factors. To handle individual factors that determine object
styles, we propose a class- and layer-wise extension to the variational
autoencoder (VAE) framework that allows flexible control over each object class
at the local to global levels by learning multiple latent spaces. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our method generates images that are both plausible and
more diverse compared to state-of-the-art methods via extensive experiments
with real and synthetic datasets inthree different domains. We also show that
our method enables a wide range of applications in image synthesis and editing
tasks.</span>

                                        <span>The paper presents a new approach to multiview video coding using Screen
Content Coding. It is assumed that for a time instant the frames corresponding
to all views are packed into a single frame, i.e. the frame-compatible approach
to multiview coding is applied. For such coding scenario, the paper
demonstrates that Screen Content Coding can be efficiently used for multiview
video coding. Two approaches are considered: the first using standard HEVC
Screen Content Coding, and the second using Advanced Screen Content Coding. The
latter is the original proposal of the authors that exploits quarter-pel motion
vectors and other nonstandard extensions of HEVC Screen Content Coding. The
experimental results demonstrate that multiview video coding even using
standard HEVC Screen Content Coding is much more efficient than simulcast HEVC
coding. The proposed Advanced Screen Content Coding provides virtually the same
coding efficiency as MV-HEVC, which is the state-of-the-art multiview video
compression technique. The authors suggest that Advanced Screen Content Coding
can be efficiently used within the new Versatile Video Coding (VVC) technology.
Nevertheless a reference multiview extension of VVC does not exist yet,
therefore, for VVC-based coding, the experimental comparisons are left for
future work.</span>

full realistic synthetic scenes is extremely cumbersome and expensive due to
the difficulty in modeling the thermal properties of the materials of the

the employment of a generative model, and study how to best combine our

                                        <span>Model-based eye tracking has been a dominant approach for eye gaze tracking
because of its ability to generalize to different subjects, without the need of
any training data and eye gaze annotations. Model-based eye tracking, however,
is susceptible to eye feature detection errors, in particular for eye tracking
in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian framework for
model-based eye tracking. The proposed system consists of a cascade-Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Network (c-BCNN) to capture the probabilistic
relationships between eye appearance and its landmarks, and a geometric eye
model to estimate eye gaze from the eye landmarks. Given a testing eye image,
the Bayesian framework can generate, through Bayesian inference, the eye gaze
distribution without explicit landmark detection and model training, based on
which it not only estimates the most likely eye gaze but also its uncertainty.
Furthermore, with Bayesian inference instead of point-based inference, our
model can not only generalize better to different sub-jects, head poses, and
environments but also is robust to image noise and landmark detection errors.
Finally, with the estimated gaze uncertainty, we can construct a cascade
architecture that allows us to progressively improve gaze estimation accuracy.
Compared to state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods, the
proposed Bayesian framework demonstrates significant improvement in
generalization capability across several benchmark datasets and in accuracy and
robustness under challenging real-world conditions.</span>

properties of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform
these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and
interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this
domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g.,
confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of
counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in
multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle
navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity
simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal
discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core
component of our work is to introduce \textit{agency}, such that it is simple
to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The
vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning
low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform
experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and
highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges

                                        <span>Previous methods for skeleton-based gesture recognition mostly arrange the
skeleton sequence into a pseudo picture or spatial-temporal graph and apply
deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
for feature extraction. Although achieving superior results, these methods have
inherent limitations in dynamically capturing local features of interactive
hand parts, and the computing efficiency still remains a serious issue. In this
work, the self-attention mechanism is introduced to alleviate this problem.
Considering the hierarchical structure of hand joints, we propose an efficient
hierarchical self-attention network (HAN) for skeleton-based gesture
recognition, which is based on pure self-attention without any CNN, RNN or GCN
operators. Specifically, the joint self-attention module is used to capture
spatial features of fingers, the finger self-attention module is designed to
aggregate features of the whole hand. In terms of temporal features, the
temporal self-attention module is utilized to capture the temporal dynamics of
the fingers and the entire hand. Finally, these features are fused by the
fusion self-attention module for gesture classification. Experiments show that
our method achieves competitive results on three gesture recognition datasets
with much lower computational complexity.</span>

                                        <span>Physics perception very often faces the problem that only limited data or
partial measurements on the scene are available. In this work, we propose a
strategy to learn the full state of sloshing liquids from measurements of the
free surface. Our approach is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
project the limited information available to a reduced-order manifold so as to
not only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of
performing fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain
physically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the
reduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the
fulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the
required hidden information to correlate the limited information with the
latent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back
to the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful
information in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a
computer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with
real information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting
future states of the observed fluid in real-time.</span>

                                        <span>Previous blind or No Reference (NR) video quality assessment (VQA) models
largely rely on features drawn from natural scene statistics (NSS), but under
the assumption that the image statistics are stationary in the spatial domain.
Several of these models are quite successful on standard pictures. However, in
Virtual Reality (VR) applications, foveated video compression is regaining
attention, and the concept of space-variant quality assessment is of interest,
given the availability of increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution
contents and practical ways of measuring gaze direction. Distortions from
foveated video compression increase with increased eccentricity, implying that
the natural scene statistics are space-variant. Towards advancing the
development of foveated compression / streaming algorithms, we have devised a
no-reference (NR) foveated video quality assessment model, called FOVQA, which
is based on new models of space-variant natural scene statistics (NSS) and
natural video statistics (NVS). Specifically, we deploy a space-variant
generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-GGD) model and a space-variant
asynchronous generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-AGGD) model of mean
subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficients and products of neighboring
MSCN coefficients, respectively. We devise a foveated video quality predictor
that extracts radial basis features, and other features that capture
perceptually annoying rapid quality fall-offs. We find that FOVQA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the new 2D LIVE-FBT-FCVR database, as
compared with other leading FIQA / VQA models. we have made our implementation
of FOVQA available at: this http URL</span>

                                        <span>The application of infrared hyperspectral imagery to geological problems is
becoming more popular as data become more accessible and cost-effective.
Clustering and classifying spectrally similar materials is often a first step
in applications ranging from economic mineral exploration on Earth to planetary
exploration on Mars. Semi-manual classification guided by expertly developed
spectral parameters can be time consuming and biased, while supervised methods
require abundant labeled data and can be difficult to generalize. Here we
develop a fully unsupervised workflow for feature extraction and clustering
informed by both expert spectral geologist input and quantitative metrics. Our
pipeline uses a lightweight autoencoder followed by Gaussian mixture modeling
to map the spectral diversity within any image. We validate the performance of
our pipeline at submillimeter-scale with expert-labelled data from the Oman
ophiolite drill core and evaluate performance at meters-scale with partially
classified orbital data of Jezero Crater on Mars (the landing site for the
Perseverance rover). We additionally examine the effects of various
preprocessing techniques used in traditional analysis of hyperspectral imagery.
This pipeline provides a fast and accurate clustering map of similar geological
materials and consistently identifies and separates major mineral classes in
both laboratory imagery and remote sensing imagery. We refer to our pipeline as
&quot;Generalized Pipeline for Spectroscopic Unsupervised clustering of Minerals
(GyPSUM).&quot;</span>

                                        <span>Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS)
applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain
under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate the
use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term
Memory-based, Domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress
estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate
independent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout
the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for
the period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth.
State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and
dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The
DgNN had a 3.5% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 33%
more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the other NNs during test years.
The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop
progress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for
all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop
growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this
study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE)
and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here
can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.</span>

                                        <span>Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for
efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable
self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively
answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered
evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to
evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority
of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling
methods.</span>

                                        <span>Generalising deep models to new data from new centres (termed here domains)
remains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics
(domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-based
meta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train and
meta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training have
shown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fully
supervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical image
segmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations.
Meanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may not
approximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. To
address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learning
framework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations related
to domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them to
reconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to better
approximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model can
achieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limited
amount of labeled data. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust on
different segmentation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art generalisation
performance on two public benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>How far can we go with textual representations for understanding pictures? In
image understanding, it is essential to use concise but detailed image
representations. Deep visual features extracted by vision models, such as
Faster R-CNN, are prevailing used in multiple tasks, and especially in visual
question answering (VQA). However, conventional deep visual features may
struggle to convey all the details in an image as we humans do. Meanwhile, with
recent language models&#x27; progress, descriptive text may be an alternative to
this problem. This paper delves into the effectiveness of textual
representations for image understanding in the specific context of VQA. We
propose to take description-question pairs as input, instead of deep visual
features, and fed them into a language-only Transformer model, simplifying the
process and the computational cost. We also experiment with data augmentation
techniques to increase the diversity in the training set and avoid learning
statistical bias. Extensive evaluations have shown that textual representations
require only about a hundred words to compete with deep visual features on both
VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2.</span>

methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at
long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we
discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement
learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception,
language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class
of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map
representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end
learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these
methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization,
mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These
modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic
understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional saliency prediction models typically learn a deterministic
mapping from images to the corresponding ground truth saliency maps. In this
paper, we study the saliency prediction problem from the perspective of
generative models by learning a conditional probability distribution over
saliency maps given an image, and treating the prediction as a sampling
process. Specifically, we propose a generative cooperative saliency prediction
framework based on the generative cooperative networks, where a conditional
latent variable model and a conditional energy-based model are jointly trained
to predict saliency in a cooperative manner. We call our model the SalCoopNets.
The latent variable model serves as a fast but coarse predictor to efficiently
produce an initial prediction, which is then refined by the iterative Langevin
revision of the energy-based model that serves as a fine predictor. Such a
coarse-to-fine cooperative saliency prediction strategy offers the best of both
worlds. Moreover, we generalize our framework to the scenario of weakly
supervised saliency prediction, where saliency annotation of training images is
partially observed, by proposing a cooperative learning while recovering
strategy. Lastly, we show that the learned energy function can serve as a
refinement module that can refine the results of other pre-trained saliency
prediction models. Experimental results show that our generative model can
achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code is publicly available at:

                                        <span>Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a powerful testbed to develop new AI
capabilities. This task necessitates learning to reason about objects,
relations, and events across visual and linguistic domains in space-time.
High-level reasoning demands lifting from associative visual pattern
recognition to symbol-like manipulation over objects, their behavior and
interactions. Toward reaching this goal we propose an object-oriented reasoning
approach in that video is abstracted as a dynamic stream of interacting
objects. At each stage of the video event flow, these objects interact with
each other, and their interactions are reasoned about with respect to the query
and under the overall context of a video. This mechanism is materialized into a
family of general-purpose neural units and their multi-level architecture
called Hierarchical Object-oriented Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (HOSTR) networks.
This neural model maintains the objects&#x27; consistent lifelines in the form of a
hierarchically nested spatio-temporal graph. Within this graph, the dynamic
interactive object-oriented representations are built up along the video
sequence, hierarchically abstracted in a bottom-up manner, and converge toward
the key information for the correct answer. The method is evaluated on multiple
major Video QA datasets and establishes new state-of-the-arts in these tasks.
Analysis into the model&#x27;s behavior indicates that object-oriented reasoning is
a reliable, interpretable and efficient approach to Video QA.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally
efficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current
methods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing
spatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high
performance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches
representing/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal
structure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational
cost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we
call Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing
fine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval
performance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network
that at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to
maintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We
train several students with different architectures and arrive at different
trade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,
including fine-grained students that store index videos using binary
representations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation
in large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS
on five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and
demonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in
several cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off
between retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In
specific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but
is 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space. Our collected
dataset and implementation are publicly available:

                                        <span>One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for
which annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we
explore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to
as Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to
learn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data
distribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the
classifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the
other. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier
decision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame
and seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting
objectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)
to maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal
frames will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows
for efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a
minimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing
the data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under
different constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized
feature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via
experiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as
anomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We
also explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via
experiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.</span>

allows interactive free-viewpoint navigation. Our method allows illumination to
be changed synthetically, while coherently rendering cast shadows and complex
glossy materials. We start with multiple images of the scene and a 3D mesh
obtained by multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction. We assume that lighting is
well-explained as the sum of a view-independent diffuse component and a
view-dependent glossy term concentrated around the mirror reflection direction.
We design a convolutional network around input feature maps that facilitate
learning of an implicit representation of scene materials and illumination,
enabling both relighting and free-viewpoint navigation. We generate these input
maps by exploiting the best elements of both image-based and physically-based
rendering. We sample the input views to estimate diffuse scene irradiance, and
compute the new illumination caused by user-specified light sources using path
tracing. To facilitate the network&#x27;s understanding of materials and synthesize
plausible glossy reflections, we reproject the views and compute mirror images.
We train the network on a synthetic dataset where each scene is also
reconstructed with MVS. We show results of our algorithm relighting real indoor
scenes and performing free-viewpoint navigation with complex and realistic
glossy reflections, which so far remained out of reach for view-synthesis
techniques.</span>

depending on multiple local clients, while keeping the training data
decentralized in order to preserve data privacy. However, standard FL methods
ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the
aggregated model. In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement,
and then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g.,
Bernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients,
we propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client
Learning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main
components: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data
quality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to
adaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the
amount of local training data and the data quality of each client. Our Fed-NCL
can be easily applied in any standard FL workflow to handle the noisy client
issue. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm
boosts the performances of different state-of-the-art systems with noisy

                                        <span>Retrieval is a crucial stage in web search that identifies a small set of
query-relevant candidates from a billion-scale corpus. Discovering more
semantically-related candidates in the retrieval stage is very promising to
expose more high-quality results to the end users. However, it still remains
non-trivial challenges of building and deploying effective retrieval models for
semantic matching in real search engine. In this paper, we describe the
retrieval system that we developed and deployed in Baidu Search. The system
exploits the recent state-of-the-art Chinese pretrained language model, namely
Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration (ERNIE), which
facilitates the system with expressive semantic matching. In particular, we
developed an ERNIE-based retrieval model, which is equipped with 1) expressive
Transformer-based semantic encoders, and 2) a comprehensive multi-stage
training paradigm. More importantly, we present a practical system workflow for
deploying the model in web-scale retrieval. Eventually, the system is fully
deployed into production, where rigorous offline and online experiments were
conducted. The results show that the system can perform high-quality candidate
retrieval, especially for those tail queries with uncommon demands. Overall,
the new retrieval system facilitated by pretrained language model (i.e., ERNIE)
can largely improve the usability and applicability of our search engine.</span>

                                        <span>Session-based recommendation aims at predicting the next item given a
sequence of previous items consumed in the session, e.g., on e-commerce or
multimedia streaming services. Specifically, session data exhibits some unique
characteristics, i.e., session consistency and sequential dependency over items
within the session, repeated item consumption, and session timeliness. In this
paper, we propose simple-yet-effective linear models for considering the
holistic aspects of the sessions. The comprehensive nature of our models helps
improve the quality of session-based recommendation. More importantly, it
provides a generalized framework for reflecting different perspectives of
session data. Furthermore, since our models can be solved by closed-form
solutions, they are highly scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed linear models show competitive or state-of-the-art performance in
various metrics on several real-world datasets.</span>

data and keywords over the years. This searching and indexing works well when
user/reader already knows about that particular creative textual artefact or
document. This indexing and search hardly takes into account interest and
emotional makeup of readers and its mapping to books. When a person is looking
for a literary textual artefact, he/she might be looking for not only
information but also to seek the joy of reading. In case of literary artefacts,
progression of emotions across the key events could prove to be the key for
indexing and searching. In this paper, we establish clusters among literary
artefacts based on computational relationships among sentiment progressions
using intelligent text analysis. We have created a database of 1076 English
titles + 20 Marathi titles and also used database
this http URL with 16559 titles and their
summaries. We have proposed Sentiment Progression based Indexing for searching
and recommending books. This can be used to create personalized clusters of
book titles of interest to readers. The analysis clearly suggests better
searching and indexing when we are targeting book lovers looking for a
particular type of book or creative artefact. This indexing and searching can
find many real-life applications for recommending books.</span>

document-to-query relevance is estimated through predicting the matching score.
Drawing from the rich literature of classical generative retrieval models, we
introduce and formalize the paradigm of deep generative retrieval models
defined via the cumulative probabilities of generating query terms. This
paradigm offers a grounded probabilistic view on relevance estimation while
still enabling the use of modern neural architectures. In contrast to the
matching paradigm, the probabilistic nature of generative rankers readily
offers a fine-grained measure of uncertainty. We adopt several current neural
generative models in our framework and introduce a novel generative ranker
(T-PGN), which combines the encoding capacity of Transformers with the Pointer
Generator Network model. We conduct an extensive set of evaluation experiments
on passage retrieval, leveraging the MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking and TREC Deep
Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking collections. Our results show the
significantly higher performance of the T-PGN model when compared with other
generative models. Lastly, we demonstrate that exploiting the uncertainty
information of deep generative rankers opens new perspectives to
query/collection understanding, and significantly improves the cut-off
prediction task.</span>

users and communities at great risk via social media platforms. Deep learning
based models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled
data on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade
on other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are
posed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events,
where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding
the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from
scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,
expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those
challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named
MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events
with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates
meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of
these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention
mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical
information and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted
on multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental
results show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen
events effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

satisfying users&#x27; information demands. More recently, neural rankers fine-tuned
from pre-trained language models (PLMs) establish state-of-the-art ranking
effectiveness. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLM-based
rankers to the large-scale web search system due to the following challenging
issues:(1) the prohibitively expensive computations of massive neural PLMs,
especially for long texts in the web-document, prohibit their deployments in an
online ranking system that demands extremely low latency;(2) the discrepancy
between existing ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the ad-hoc
retrieval scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling is another
main barrier for improving the online ranking system;(3) a real-world search
engine typically involves a committee of ranking components, and thus the
compatibility of the individually fine-tuned ranking model is critical for a
cooperative ranking system. In this work, we contribute a series of
successfully applied techniques in tackling these exposed issues when deploying
the state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained language model, i.e., ERNIE, in the
online search engine system. We first articulate a novel practice to
cost-efficiently summarize the web document and contextualize the resultant
summary content with the query using a cheap yet powerful Pyramid-ERNIE
architecture. Then we endow an innovative paradigm to finely exploit the
large-scale noisy and biased post-click behavioral data for relevance-oriented
pre-training. We also propose a human-anchored fine-tuning strategy tailored
for the online ranking system, aiming to stabilize the ranking signals across
various online components. Extensive offline and online experimental results
show that the proposed techniques significantly boost the search engine&#x27;s
performance.</span>

discrimination possibly caused by traditional recommenders. In Interactive
Recommender Systems (IRS), user preferences and the system&#x27;s fairness status
are constantly changing over time. Existing fairness-aware recommenders mainly
consider fairness in static settings. Directly applying existing methods to IRS
will result in poor recommendation. To resolve this problem, we propose a
reinforcement learning based framework, FairRec, to dynamically maintain a
long-term balance between accuracy and fairness in IRS. User preferences and
the system&#x27;s fairness status are jointly compressed into the state

news feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is
incorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts
have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden
evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing
approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a
current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,
these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring
latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance
degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all
prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the
multi-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between
evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across
time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with
a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully
discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate
model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the
inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter
algorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.
In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is
exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the
sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The
proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against
the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in
terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document
time prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Spreadsheet table detection is the task of detecting all tables on a given
sheet and locating their respective ranges. Automatic table detection is a key
enabling technique and an initial step in spreadsheet data intelligence.
However, the detection task is challenged by the diversity of table structures
and table layouts on the spreadsheet. Considering the analogy between a cell
matrix as spreadsheet and a pixel matrix as image, and encouraged by the
successful application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in computer
vision, we have developed TableSense, a novel end-to-end framework for
spreadsheet table detection. First, we devise an effective cell featurization
scheme to better leverage the rich information in each cell; second, we develop
an enhanced convolutional neural network model for table detection to meet the
domain-specific requirement on precise table boundary detection; third, we
propose an effective uncertainty metric to guide an active learning based smart
sampling algorithm, which enables the efficient build-up of a training dataset
with 22,176 tables on 10,220 sheets with broad coverage of diverse table
structures and layouts. Our evaluation shows that TableSense is highly
effective with 91.3\% recall and 86.5\% precision in EoB-2 metric, a
significant improvement over both the current detection algorithm that are used
in commodity spreadsheet tools and state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks in computer vision.</span>

                                        <span>Information overload is a prevalent challenge in many high-value domains. A
prominent case in point is the explosion of the biomedical literature on
COVID-19, which swelled to hundreds of thousands of papers in a matter of
months. In general, biomedical literature expands by two papers every minute,
totalling over a million new papers every year. Search in the biomedical realm,
and many other vertical domains is challenging due to the scarcity of direct
supervision from click logs. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a
promising direction to overcome the annotation bottleneck. We propose a general
approach for vertical search based on domain-specific pretraining and present a
case study for the biomedical domain. Despite being substantially simpler and
not using any relevance labels for training or development, our method performs
comparably or better than the best systems in the official TREC-COVID
evaluation, a COVID-related biomedical search competition. Using distributed
computing in modern cloud infrastructure, our system can scale to tens of
millions of articles on PubMed and has been deployed as Microsoft Biomedical
Search, a new search experience for biomedical literature:

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally
efficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current
methods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing
spatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high
performance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches
representing/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal
structure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational
cost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we
call Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing
fine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval
performance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network
that at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to
maintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We
train several students with different architectures and arrive at different
trade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,
including fine-grained students that store index videos using binary
representations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation
in large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS
on five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and
demonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in
several cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off
between retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In
specific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but
is 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space. Our collected
dataset and implementation are publicly available:

deep ReLU networks for smooth functions in terms of both width and depth
simultaneously. To that end, we first prove that multivariate polynomials can
be approximated by deep ReLU networks of width $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and depth
$\mathcal{O}(L)$ with an approximation error $\mathcal{O}(N^{-L})$. Through
local Taylor expansions and their deep ReLU network approximations, we show
that deep ReLU networks of width $\mathcal{O}(N\ln N)$ and depth
$\mathcal{O}(L\ln L)$ can approximate $f\in C^s([0,1]^d)$ with a nearly optimal
approximation error $\mathcal{O}(\|f\|_{C^s([0,1]^d)}N^{-2s/d}L^{-2s/d})$. Our
estimate is non-asymptotic in the sense that it is valid for arbitrary width
and depth specified by $N\in\mathbb{N}^+$ and $L\in\mathbb{N}^+$, respectively.</span>

implementations, training, and evaluation has made fair and thorough
comparisons difficult. In order to assess the reproducibility of previously
published results, we re-implemented and evaluated 21 interaction models in the
PyKEEN software package. Here, we outline which results could be reproduced
with their reported hyper-parameters, which could only be reproduced with
alternate hyper-parameters, and which could not be reproduced at all as well as
provide insight as to why this might be the case.

We then performed a large-scale benchmarking on four datasets with several
thousands of experiments and 24,804 GPU hours of computation time. We present
insights gained as to best practices, best configurations for each model, and
where improvements could be made over previously published best configurations.
Our results highlight that the combination of model architecture, training
approach, loss function, and the explicit modeling of inverse relations is
crucial for a model&#x27;s performances, and not only determined by the model
architecture. We provide evidence that several architectures can obtain results
competitive to the state-of-the-art when configured carefully. We have made all

                                        <span>Our goal is to perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, i.e., to detect
when a robot is operating in environments that are drawn from a different
distribution than the environments used to train the robot. We leverage
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes theory in order to train a policy
with a guaranteed bound on performance on the training distribution. Our key
idea for OOD detection then relies on the following intuition: violation of the
performance bound on test environments provides evidence that the robot is
operating OOD. We formalize this via statistical techniques based on p-values
and concentration inequalities. The resulting approach (i) provides guaranteed
confidence bounds on OOD detection, and (ii) is task-driven and sensitive only
to changes that impact the robot&#x27;s performance. We demonstrate our approach on
a simulated example of grasping objects with unfamiliar poses or shapes. We
also present both simulation and hardware experiments for a drone performing
vision-based obstacle avoidance in unfamiliar environments (including wind
disturbances and different obstacle densities). Our examples demonstrate that
we can perform task-driven OOD detection within just a handful of trials.
Comparisons with baselines also demonstrate the advantages of our approach in
terms of providing statistical guarantees and being insensitive to
task-irrelevant distribution shifts.</span>

                                        <span>Stochastic nested optimization, including stochastic compositional, min-max
and bilevel optimization, is gaining popularity in many machine learning
applications. While the three problems share the nested structure, existing
works often treat them separately, and thus develop problem-specific algorithms
and their analyses. Among various exciting developments, simple SGD-type
updates (potentially on multiple variables) are still prevalent in solving this
class of nested problems, but they are believed to have slower convergence rate
compared to that of the non-nested problems. This paper unifies several
SGD-type updates for stochastic nested problems into a single SGD approach that
we term ALternating Stochastic gradient dEscenT (ALSET) method. By leveraging
the hidden smoothness of the problem, this paper presents a tighter analysis of
ALSET for stochastic nested problems. Under the new analysis, to achieve an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the nested problem, it requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. Under certain regularity conditions, applying our
results to stochastic compositional, min-max and reinforcement learning
problems either improves or matches the best-known sample complexity in the
respective cases. Our results explain why simple SGD-type algorithms in

                                        <span>A high efficiency hardware integration of neural networks benefits from
realizing nonlinearity, network connectivity and learning fully in a physical
substrate. Multiple systems have recently implemented some or all of these
operations, yet the focus was placed on addressing technological challenges.
Fundamental questions regarding learning in hardware neural networks remain
largely unexplored. Noise in particular is unavoidable in such architectures,
and here we investigate its interaction with a learning algorithm using an
opto-electronic recurrent neural network. We find that noise strongly modifies
the system&#x27;s path during convergence, and surprisingly fully decorrelates the
final readout weight matrices. This highlights the importance of understanding
architecture, noise and learning algorithm as interacting players, and
therefore identifies the need for mathematical tools for noisy, analogue system
optimization.</span>

on -- and is a stronger version of -- the observation in Nakkiran &amp; Bansal &#x27;20,

                                        <span>Mean field games (MFG) and mean field control problems (MFC) are frameworks
to study Nash equilibria or social optima in games with a continuum of agents.
These problems can be used to approximate competitive or cooperative games with
a large finite number of agents and have found a broad range of applications,
in particular in economics. In recent years, the question of learning in MFG
and MFC has garnered interest, both as a way to compute solutions and as a way
to model how large populations of learners converge to an equilibrium. Of
particular interest is the setting where the agents do not know the model,
which leads to the development of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. After
reviewing the literature on this topic, we present a two timescale approach
with RL for MFG and MFC, which relies on a unified Q-learning algorithm. The
main novelty of this method is to simultaneously update an action-value
function and a distribution but with different rates, in a model-free fashion.
Depending on the ratio of the two learning rates, the algorithm learns either
the MFG or the MFC solution. To illustrate this method, we apply it to a mean
field problem of accumulated consumption in finite horizon with HARA utility
function, and to a trader&#x27;s optimal liquidation problem.</span>

The assessment of the impact of lockdown on air quality focused on four

factors were obtained using global satellite observations. The level of the
employed prevention measures is employed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government

                                        <span>Temporally and spatially dependent uncertain parameters are regularly
encountered in engineering applications. Commonly these uncertainties are
accounted for using random fields and processes which require knowledge about
the appearing probability distributions functions which is not readily
available. In these cases non-probabilistic approaches such as interval
analysis and fuzzy set theory are helpful uncertainty measures. Partial
differential equations involving fuzzy and interval fields are traditionally
solved using the finite element method where the input fields are sampled using
some basis function expansion methods. This approach however is problematic, as
it is reliant on knowledge about the spatial correlation fields. In this work
we utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve interval and fuzzy
partial differential equations. The resulting network structures termed
interval physics-informed neural networks (iPINNs) and fuzzy physics-informed
neural networks (fPINNs) show promising results for obtaining bounded solutions
of equations involving spatially uncertain parameter fields. In contrast to
finite element approaches, no correlation length specification of the input
fields as well as no averaging via Monte-Carlo simulations are necessary. In
fact, information about the input interval fields is obtained directly as a
byproduct of the presented solution scheme. Furthermore, all major advantages
of PINNs are retained, i.e. meshfree nature of the scheme, and ease of inverse
problem set-up.</span>

where the reward distribution changes if a collision occurs on the arm.
Existing literature always assumes a zero reward for involved players if
collision happens, but for applications such as cognitive radio, the more
realistic scenario is that collision reduces the mean reward but not
necessarily to zero. We focus on the more practical no-sensing setting where
players do not perceive collisions directly, and propose the Error-Correction
Collision Communication (EC3) algorithm that models implicit communication as a
reliable communication over noisy channel problem, for which random coding
error exponent is used to establish the optimal regret that no communication
protocol can beat. Finally, optimizing the tradeoff between code length and
decoding error rate leads to a regret that approaches the centralized MP-MAB
regret, which represents a natural lower bound. Experiments with practical
error-correction codes on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
the superiority of EC3. In particular, the results show that the choice of
coding schemes has a profound impact on the regret performance.</span>

automatically on a daily basis by mutation engines that transform the code of a
malicious program while retaining its functionality, in order to evade
signature-based detection. These automatic processes have greatly increased the
number of malware variants, deeming their fully-manual analysis impossible.
Malware classification is the task of determining to which family a new
malicious variant belongs. Variants of the same malware family show similar
behavioral patterns. Thus, classifying newly discovered malicious programs and
applications helps assess the risks they pose. Moreover, malware classification
facilitates determining which of the newly discovered variants should undergo
manual analysis by a security expert, in order to determine whether they belong
to a new family (e.g., one whose members exploit a zero-day vulnerability) or
are simply the result of a concept drift within a known malicious family. This
motivated intense research in recent years on devising high-accuracy automatic
tools for malware classification. In this work, we present DAEMON - a novel
dataset-agnostic malware classifier. A key property of DAEMON is that the type
of features it uses and the manner in which they are mined facilitate
understanding the distinctive behavior of malware families, making its
classification decisions explainable. We&#x27;ve optimized DAEMON using a
large-scale dataset of x86 binaries, belonging to a mix of several malware
families targeting computers running Windows. We then re-trained it and applied
it, without any algorithmic change, feature re-engineering or parameter tuning,
to two other large-scale datasets of malicious Android applications consisting
of numerous malware families. DAEMON obtained highly accurate classification
results on all datasets, establishing that it is also platform-agnostic.</span>

learning of state observers that are: robust to modeling error, computationally
tractable to design, and capable of operating with guaranteed performance. In
this paper, a modular design methodology is formulated, that consists of three
design phases: (i) an initial robust observer design that enables one to learn
the dynamics without allowing the state estimation error to diverge (hence,
safe); (ii) a learning phase wherein the unmodeled components are estimated
using Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes; and, (iii) a re-design
phase that leverages the learned dynamics to improve convergence rate of the
state estimation error. The potential of our proposed learning-based observer
is demonstrated on a benchmark nonlinear system. Additionally, certificates of
guaranteed estimation performance are provided.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in image synthesis enables one to translate images by
learning the mapping between a source domain and a target domain. Existing
methods tend to learn the distributions by training a model on a variety of
datasets, with results evaluated largely in a subjective manner. Relatively few
works in this area, however, study the potential use of semantic image
translation methods for image recognition tasks. In this paper, we explore the
use of Single Image Texture Translation (SITT) for data augmentation. We first
propose a lightweight model for translating texture to images based on a single
input of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing. Based on SITT,
we then explore the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image
classification tasks. We find the proposed method is capable of translating
input data into a target domain, leading to consistent improved image
recognition performance. Finally, we examine how SITT and related image
translation methods can provide a basis for a data-efficient, augmentation
engineering approach to model training.</span>

Identifying the disease-causing mutations from millions of genetic variants
within an individual patient is a challenging problem. Computational methods
which can prioritize disease-causing mutations have, therefore, enormous
applications. It is well-known that genes function through a complex regulatory
network. However, existing variant effect prediction models only consider a
variant in isolation. In contrast, we propose VEGN, which models variant effect
prediction using a graph neural network (GNN) that operates on a heterogeneous
graph with genes and variants. The graph is created by assigning variants to
genes and connecting genes with an gene-gene interaction network. In this
context, we explore an approach where a gene-gene graph is given and another
where VEGN learns the gene-gene graph and therefore operates both on given and
learnt edges. The graph neural network is trained to aggregate information
between genes, and between genes and variants. Variants can exchange
information via the genes they connect to. This approach improves the
performance of existing state-of-the-art models.</span>

a large number of papers innovating on the subject are published. However,
while most of these publications provide incremental improvements to existing
algorithms, they tend to be presented as new optimizers rather than composable
algorithms. Thus, many worthwhile improvements are rarely seen out of their
initial publication. Taking advantage of this untapped potential, we introduce
Ranger21, a new optimizer which combines AdamW with eight components, carefully
selected after reviewing and testing ideas from the literature. We found that
the resulting optimizer provides significantly improved validation accuracy and
training speed, smoother training curves, and is even able to train a ResNet50

require model simplifications, or use overly conservative surrogate models.
Neural networks can circumvent these limitations but are faced with high

uncertainty over weights and activations, and are trained using Bayesian
inference. Since these probabilistic layers are designed to be drop-in
replacement of their deterministic counter parts, Bayesian neural networks
provide a direct and natural way to extend conventional deep neural networks to
support probabilistic deep learning. However, it is nontrivial to understand,
design and train Bayesian neural networks due to their complexities. We discuss
the essentials of Bayesian neural networks including duality (deep neural
networks, probabilistic models), approximate Bayesian inference, Bayesian
priors, Bayesian posteriors, and deep variational learning. We use TensorFlow
Probability APIs and code examples for illustration. The main problem with
Bayesian neural networks is that the architecture of deep neural networks makes
it quite redundant, and costly, to account for uncertainty for a large number
of successive layers. Hybrid Bayesian neural networks, which use few
probabilistic layers judicially positioned in the networks, provide a practical
solution.</span>

of energy-based models that define a joint density over data and latent

have similar use cases as variational autoencoders, in the sense that they
learn an unsupervised mapping from data to latent variables. However, these

Federated Learning (FL). Recently, there has been a line of work on
incorporating the formal privacy notion of differential privacy with FL. To
guarantee the client-level differential privacy in FL algorithms, the clients&#x27;
transmitted model updates have to be clipped before adding privacy noise. Such
clipping operation is substantially different from its counterpart of gradient
clipping in the centralized differentially private SGD and has not been
well-understood. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that the
clipped FedAvg can perform surprisingly well even with substantial data
heterogeneity when training neural networks, which is partly because the
clients&#x27; updates become similar for several popular deep architectures. Based
on this key observation, we provide the convergence analysis of a differential
private (DP) FedAvg algorithm and highlight the relationship between clipping
bias and the distribution of the clients&#x27; updates. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously investigates theoretical and
empirical issues regarding the clipping operation in FL algorithms.</span>

neural network that directly maps the outputs of a linear acoustic echo
canceler to the desired signal in the spectral domain. This system embeds a
design parameter that allows a tunable tradeoff between the desired-signal
distortion and residual echo suppression in double-talk scenarios. The system
employs 136 thousand parameters, and requires 1.6 Giga floating-point
operations per second and 10 Mega-bytes of memory. The implementation satisfies
both the timing requirements of the AEC challenge and the computational and
memory limitations of on-device applications. Experiments are conducted with
161~h of data from the AEC challenge database and from real independent
recordings. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system in real-life
conditions and compare it with two competing methods regarding echo suppression
and desired-signal distortion, generalization to various environments, and
robustness to high echo levels.</span>

by using dataset and function descriptions while significantly decreasing
computation time from minutes to milliseconds by using a zero-shot approach.
Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by
reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be
used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call
privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to
process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information
improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of
unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide
a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual
descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification
performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves
classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a
graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data
meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict
the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot
fashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a
supervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require
tens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations. We show that zero-shot AutoML reduces
running and prediction times from minutes to milliseconds, consistently across
datasets. By speeding up AutoML by orders of magnitude this work demonstrates
real-time AutoML.</span>

                                        <span>The abundant sequential documents such as online archival, social media and
news feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is
incorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts
have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden
evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing
approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a
current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,
these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring
latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance
degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all
prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the
multi-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between
evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across
time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with
a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully
discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate
model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the
inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter
algorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.
In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is
exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the
sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The
proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against
the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in
terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document
time prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Building classifiers on multiple domains is a practical problem in the real
life. Instead of building classifiers one by one, multi-domain learning (MDL)
simultaneously builds classifiers on multiple domains. MDL utilizes the
information shared among the domains to improve the performance. As a
supervised learning problem, the labeling effort is still high in MDL problems.
Usually, this high labeling cost issue could be relieved by using active
learning. Thus, it is natural to utilize active learning to reduce the labeling
effort in MDL, and we refer this setting as multi-domain active learning
(MDAL). However, there are only few works which are built on this setting. And
when the researches have to face this problem, there is no off-the-shelf
solutions. Under this circumstance, combining the current multi-domain learning
models and single-domain active learning strategies might be a preliminary
solution for MDAL problem. To find out the potential of this preliminary
solution, a comparative study over 5 models and 4 selection strategies is made
in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work provides
the formal definition of MDAL. Besides, this is the first comparative work for
MDAL problem. From the results, the Multinomial Adversarial Networks (MAN)
model with a simple best vs second best (BvSB) uncertainty strategy shows its
superiority in most cases. We take this combination as our off-the-shelf
recommendation for the MDAL problem.</span>

hold great promise for engineering challenges ranging from gas separations to
catalysis, a lack of understanding of how to improve their stability limits
their use in practice. To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of
published reports of the key aspects of MOF stability necessary for their
practical application: the ability to withstand high temperatures without
degrading and the capacity to be activated by removal of solvent molecules.
From nearly 4,000 manuscripts, we use natural language processing and automated
image analysis to obtain over 2,000 solvent-removal stability measures and
3,000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between
stability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to
identify limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By
training predictive machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial
neural network) models to encode the structure-property relationships with
graph- and pore-structure-based representations, we are able to make
predictions of stability orders of magnitude faster than conventional
physics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of important features in
ML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies to engineer
increased stability into typically unstable 3d-containing MOFs that are
frequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach to
accelerate the time to discovery of stable, practical MOF materials for a wide
range of applications.</span>

                                        <span>Time series forecasting based on deep architectures has been gaining
popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex non-linear
temporal dynamics. The recurrent neural network is one such model capable of
handling variable-length input and output. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in deep generative models and the concept of state space models to
propose a stochastic adaptation of the recurrent neural network for
multistep-ahead time series forecasting, which is trained with stochastic
gradient variational Bayes. In our model design, the transition function of the
recurrent neural network, which determines the evolution of the hidden states,
is stochastic rather than deterministic as in a regular recurrent neural
network; this is achieved by incorporating a latent random variable into the
transition process which captures the stochasticity of the temporal dynamics.
Our model preserves the architectural workings of a recurrent neural network
for which all relevant information is encapsulated in its hidden states, and
this flexibility allows our model to be easily integrated into any deep
architecture for sequential modelling. We test our model on a wide range of
datasets from finance to healthcare; results show that the stochastic recurrent
neural network consistently outperforms its deterministic counterpart.</span>

                                        <span>Various incremental learning (IL) approaches have been proposed to help deep
learning models learn new tasks/classes continuously without forgetting what
was learned previously (i.e., avoid catastrophic forgetting). With the growing
number of deployed audio sensing applications that need to dynamically
incorporate new tasks and changing input distribution from users, the ability
of IL on-device becomes essential for both efficiency and user privacy.

However, prior works suffer from high computational costs and storage demands
which hinders the deployment of IL on-device. In this work, to overcome these
limitations, we develop an end-to-end and on-device IL framework, FastICARL,
that incorporates an exemplar-based IL and quantization in the context of
audio-based applications. We first employ k-nearest-neighbor to reduce the
latency of IL. Then, we jointly utilize a quantization technique to decrease
the storage requirements of IL. We implement FastICARL on two types of mobile
devices and demonstrate that FastICARL remarkably decreases the IL time up to
78-92% and the storage requirements by 2-4 times without sacrificing its
performance. FastICARL enables complete on-device IL, ensuring user privacy as
the user data does not need to leave the device.</span>

                                        <span>We address the problem of inferring descriptions of system behavior using
Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) from a finite set of positive and negative
examples. Most of the existing approaches for solving such a task rely on
predefined templates for guiding the structure of the inferred formula. The
approaches that can infer arbitrary LTL formulas, on the other hand, are not
robust to noise in the data. To alleviate such limitations, we devise two
algorithms for inferring concise LTL formulas even in the presence of noise.
Our first algorithm infers minimal LTL formulas by reducing the inference
problem to a problem in maximum satisfiability and then using off-the-shelf
MaxSAT solvers to find a solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to incorporate the usage of MaxSAT solvers for inferring formulas in LTL.
Our second learning algorithm relies on the first algorithm to derive a
decision tree over LTL formulas based on a decision tree learning algorithm. We
have implemented both our algorithms and verified that our algorithms are
efficient in extracting concise LTL descriptions even in the presence of noise.</span>

networks (NNs), and their choice plays a predominant role in the performance of
a NN. In this work, we are particularly interested in the estimation of
flexible activation functions using tensor-based solutions, where the AFs are
expressed as a weighted sum of predefined basis functions. To do so, we propose
a new learning algorithm which solves a constrained coupled matrix-tensor
factorization (CMTF) problem. This technique fuses the first and zeroth order
information of the NN, where the first-order information is contained in a
Jacobian tensor, following a constrained canonical polyadic decomposition
(CPD). The proposed algorithm can handle different decomposition bases. The
goal of this method is to compress large pretrained NN models, by replacing
subnetworks, {\em i.e.,} one or multiple layers of the original network, by a
new flexible layer. The approach is applied to a pretrained convolutional

                                        <span>Structured stochastic multi-armed bandits provide accelerated regret rates
over the standard unstructured bandit problems. Most structured bandits,
however, assume the knowledge of the structural parameter such as Lipschitz
continuity, which is often not available. To cope with the latent structural
parameter, we consider a transfer learning setting in which an agent must learn
to transfer the structural information from the prior tasks to the next task,
which is inspired by practical problems such as rate adaptation in wireless
link. We propose a novel framework to provably and accurately estimate the
Lipschitz constant based on previous tasks and fully exploit it for the new
task at hand. We analyze the efficiency of the proposed framework in two folds:
(i) the sample complexity of our estimator matches with the
information-theoretic fundamental limit; and (ii) our regret bound on the new
task is close to that of the oracle algorithm with the full knowledge of the
Lipschitz constant under mild assumptions. Our analysis reveals a set of useful
insights on transfer learning for latent Lipschitzconstants such as the
fundamental challenge a learner faces. Our numerical evaluations confirm our
theoretical findings and show the superiority of the proposed framework
compared to baselines.</span>

wherein one must repeatedly make an appropriate choice from a set of
alternatives. Expert judgements, whether human or artificial, can help in
taking correct decisions, especially when exploration of alternative solutions
is costly. As expert opinions might deviate, the problem of finding the right
alternative can be approached as a collective decision making problem (CDM).
Current state-of-the-art approaches to solve CDM are limited by the quality of
the best expert in the group, and perform poorly if experts are not qualified
or if they are overly biased, thus potentially derailing the decision-making
process. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic approach based on
contextual multi-armed bandit problems (CMAB) to identify and counteract such
biased expertises. We explore homogeneous, heterogeneous and polarised expert
groups and show that this approach is able to effectively exploit the
collective expertise, irrespective of whether the provided advice is directly
conducive to good performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods,
especially when the quality of the provided expertise degrades. Our novel
CMAB-inspired approach achieves a higher final performance and does so while
converging more rapidly than previous adaptive algorithms, especially when
heterogeneous expertise is readily available.</span>

employ some deep learning algorithms for detecting the presence of a specific
sound of interest. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning-based AED systems
against evasion attacks through adversarial examples. We run multiple security
critical AED tasks, implemented as CNNs classifiers, and then generate audio
adversarial examples using two different types of noise, namely background and
white noise, that can be used by the adversary to evade detection. We also
examine the robustness of existing third-party AED capable devices, such as
Nest devices manufactured by Google, which run their own black-box deep
learning models.

We show that an adversary can focus on audio adversarial inputs to cause AED
systems to misclassify, similarly to what has been previously done by works
focusing on adversarial examples from the image domain. We then, seek to
improve classifiers&#x27; robustness through countermeasures to the attacks. We
employ adversarial training and a custom denoising technique. We show that
these countermeasures, when applied to audio input, can be successful, either
in isolation or in combination, generating relevant increases of nearly fifty
percent in the performance of the classifiers when these are under attack.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, a mechanistic data-driven approach is proposed to accelerate
structural topology optimization, employing an in-house developed finite
element convolutional neural network (FE-CNN). Our approach can be divided into
two stages: offline training, and online optimization. During offline training,
a mapping function is built between high and low resolution representations of
a given design domain. The mapping is expressed by a FE-CNN, which targets a
common objective function value (e.g., structural compliance) across design
domains of differing resolutions. During online optimization, an arbitrary
design domain of high resolution is reduced to low resolution through the
trained mapping function. The original high-resolution domain is thus designed
by computations performed on only the low-resolution version, followed by an
inverse mapping back to the high-resolution domain. Numerical examples
demonstrate that this approach can accelerate optimization by up to an order of
magnitude in computational time. Our proposed approach therefore shows great
potential to overcome the curse-of-dimensionality incurred by density-based
structural topology optimization. The limitation of our present approach is
also discussed.</span>

(PPMM) algorithm for nonconvex tuning-free robust regression problems. The
basic idea is to apply the proximal majorization-minimization algorithm to
solve the nonconvex problem with the inner subproblems solved by a sparse
semismooth Newton (SSN) method based proximal point algorithm (PPA). We must
emphasize that the main difficulty in the design of the algorithm lies in how
to overcome the singular difficulty of the inner subproblem. Furthermore, we
also prove that the PPMM algorithm converges to a d-stationary point. Due to
the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property of the problem, we present the
convergence rate of the PPMM algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks (GNN) is in great need
because of the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world graph/network
data. Graph contrastive learning (GCL), by training GNNs to maximize the
correspondence between the representations of the same graph in its different
augmented forms, may yield robust and transferable GNNs even without using
labels. However, GNNs trained by traditional GCL often risk capturing redundant
graph features and thus may be brittle and provide sub-par performance in
downstream tasks. Here, we propose a novel principle, termed adversarial-GCL
(AD-GCL), which enables GNNs to avoid capturing redundant information during
the training by optimizing adversarial graph augmentation strategies used in
GCL. We pair AD-GCL with theoretical explanations and design a practical
instantiation based on trainable edge-dropping graph augmentation. We
experimentally validate AD-GCL by comparing with the state-of-the-art GCL
methods and achieve performance gains of up-to $14\%$ in unsupervised, $6\%$ in
transfer, and $3\%$ in semi-supervised learning settings overall with 18
different benchmark datasets for the tasks of molecule property regression and
classification, and social network classification.</span>

                                        <span>While multifidelity modeling provides a cost-effective way to conduct
uncertainty quantification with computationally expensive models, much greater
efficiency can be achieved by adaptively deciding the number of required
high-fidelity (HF) simulations, depending on the type and complexity of the
problem and the desired accuracy in the results. We propose a framework for
active learning with multifidelity modeling emphasizing the efficient
estimation of rare events. Our framework works by fusing a low-fidelity (LF)
prediction with an HF-inferred correction, filtering the corrected LF
prediction to decide whether to call the high-fidelity model, and for enhanced
subsequent accuracy, adapting the correction for the LF prediction after every
HF model call. The framework does not make any assumptions as to the LF model
type or its correlations with the HF model. In addition, for improved
robustness when estimating smaller failure probabilities, we propose using
dynamic active learning functions that decide when to call the HF model. We
demonstrate our framework using several academic case studies and two finite
element (FE) model case studies: estimating Navier-Stokes velocities using the
Stokes approximation and estimating stresses in a transversely isotropic model
subjected to displacements via a coarsely meshed isotropic model. Across these
case studies, not only did the proposed framework estimate the failure
probabilities accurately, but compared with either Monte Carlo or a standard
variance reduction method, it also required only a small fraction of the calls
to the HF model.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, bladder cancer has been significantly increased in terms of
incidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour
growth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
In this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis
and can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to
grade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical
techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded
Attention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into
different severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established
in the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully
unsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and
infiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our
system outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a
convolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the
latent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final
average accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported
class activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the
same patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior
annotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on
labelled data.</span>

minimizAtioN framework for non-smooth non-convex optimization problems. To the
best of our knowledge, TITAN is the first framework of block-coordinate update
method that relies on the majorization-minimization framework while embedding
inertial force to each step of the block updates. The inertial force is
obtained via an extrapolation operator that subsumes heavy-ball and
Nesterov-type accelerations for block proximal gradient methods as special
cases. By choosing various surrogate functions, such as proximal, Lipschitz
gradient, Bregman, quadratic, and composite surrogate functions, and by varying
the extrapolation operator, TITAN produces a rich set of inertial
block-coordinate update methods. We study sub-sequential convergence as well as
global convergence for the generated sequence of TITAN. We illustrate the
effectiveness of TITAN on two important machine learning problems, namely
sparse non-negative matrix factorization and matrix completion.</span>

sensitive to the search&#x27;s initial conditions. The absence of guarantees of
performance and robustness hinders trustworthiness. In this paper, we take a
disciplined approach towards counterfactual explanations for tree ensembles. We
advocate for a model-based search aiming at &quot;optimal&quot; explanations and propose
efficient mixed-integer programming approaches. We show that isolation forests
can be modeled within our framework to focus the search on plausible
explanations with a low outlier score. We provide comprehensive coverage of
additional constraints that model important objectives, heterogeneous data
types, structural constraints on the feature space, along with resource and
actionability restrictions. Our experimental analyses demonstrate that the
proposed search approach requires a computational effort that is orders of
magnitude smaller than previous mathematical programming algorithms. It scales
up to large data sets and tree ensembles, where it provides, within seconds,
systematic explanations grounded on well-defined models solved to optimality.</span>

                                        <span>Data augmentation is a key element of deep learning pipelines, as it informs
the network during training about transformations of the input data that keep
the label unchanged. Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and
parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular,
while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of
augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as
neuroscience signals. Moreover, label independent strategies might not be
suitable for such structured data and class-dependent augmentations might be
necessary. This idea has been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, while
it is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the
object class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange
does. This paper aims to increase the generalization power added through
class-wise data augmentation. Yet, as seeking transformations depending on the
class largely increases the complexity of the task, using gradient-free
optimization techniques as done by most existing automatic approaches becomes
intractable for real-world datasets. For this reason we propose to use
differentiable data augmentation amenable to gradient-based learning. EEG
signals are a perfect example of data for which good augmentation policies are
mostly unknown. In this work, we demonstrate the relevance of our approach on
the clinically relevant sleep staging classification task, for which we also
propose differentiable transformations.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have recently shown great success in the task of blind
source separation, both under monaural and binaural settings. Although these
methods were shown to produce high-quality separations, they were mainly
applied under offline settings, in which the model has access to the full input
signal while separating the signal. In this study, we convert a non-causal
state-of-the-art separation model into a causal and real-time model and
evaluate its performance under both online and offline settings. We compare the
performance of the proposed model to several baseline methods under anechoic,
noisy, and noisy-reverberant recording conditions while exploring both monaural
and binaural inputs and outputs. Our findings shed light on the relative
difference between causal and non-causal models when performing separation. Our
stateful implementation for online separation leads to a minor drop in
performance compared to the offline model; 0.8dB for monaural inputs and 0.3dB
for binaural inputs while reaching a real-time factor of 0.65. Samples can be

                                        <span>Adversarial robustness has emerged as a desirable property for neural
networks. Prior work shows that robust networks perform well in some
out-of-distribution generalization tasks, such as transfer learning and outlier
detection. We uncover a different kind of out-of-distribution generalization
property of such networks, and find that they also do well in a task that we
call nearest category generalization (NCG) - given an out-of-distribution
input, they tend to predict the same label as that of the closest training
example. We empirically show that this happens even when the
out-of-distribution inputs lie outside the robustness radius of the training
data, which suggests that these networks may generalize better along unseen
directions on the natural image manifold than arbitrary unseen directions. We
examine how performance changes when we change the robustness regions during
training. We then design experiments to investigate the connection between
out-of-distribution detection and nearest category generalization. Taken
together, our work provides evidence that robust neural networks may resemble
nearest neighbor classifiers in their behavior on out-of-distribution data. The

                                        <span>Human mobility drives major societal phenomena including epidemics,
economies, and innovation. Historically, mobility was constrained by geographic
distance, however, in the globalizing world, language, culture, and history are
increasingly important. We propose using the neural embedding model word2vec
for studying mobility and capturing its complexity. Word2ec is shown to be
mathematically equivalent to the gravity model of mobility, and using three
human trajectory datasets, we demonstrate that it encodes nuanced relationships
between locations into a vector-space, providing a measure of effective
distance that outperforms baselines. Focusing on the case of scientific
mobility, we show that embeddings uncover cultural, linguistic, and
hierarchical relationships at multiple levels of granularity. Connecting neural
embeddings to the gravity model opens up new avenues for the study of mobility.</span>

allows loss functions to depend on past decisions and thus captures temporal
effects of learning problems. In this paper, we introduce dynamic policy regret
as the performance measure to design algorithms robust to non-stationary
environments, which competes algorithms&#x27; decisions with a sequence of changing
comparators. We propose a novel algorithm for OCO with memory that provably
enjoys an optimal dynamic policy regret. The key technical challenge is how to
control the switching cost, the cumulative movements of player&#x27;s decisions,
which is neatly addressed by a novel decomposition of dynamic policy regret and
an appropriate meta-expert structure. Furthermore, we apply the results to the
problem of online non-stochastic control, i.e., controlling a linear dynamical
system with adversarial disturbance and convex loss functions. We derive a
novel gradient-based controller with dynamic policy regret guarantees, which is
the first controller competitive to a sequence of changing policies.</span>

large amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has
become a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring
quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$
trillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in
comparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model
achieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a transformer-based procedure for the efficient
registration of non-rigid 3D point clouds. The proposed approach is data-driven
and adopts for the first time the transformer architecture in the registration
task. Our method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed
template with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation
cues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the
template properties to the input geometry. Alternatively, given a pair of
shapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa),
obtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both
contexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications
such as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show
that including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the
learning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can
train our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences
($10\sim20\%$ of the total points). The proposed model and the analysis that we
perform pave the way for future exploration of transformer-based architectures
for registration and matching applications. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods
for deformable and unordered 3D data registration on different datasets and
scenarios.</span>

have shown promise in learning object priors or constraints to improve the

almost exclusively relied on real-valued networks. It was recently observed,
however, that complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) exhibit superior
performance in applications in which the input is naturally complex-valued,
such as MRI fingerprinting. While the mathematical theory of real-valued
networks has, by now, reached some level of maturity, this is far from true for
complex-valued networks. In this paper, we analyze the expressivity of
complex-valued networks by providing explicit quantitative error bounds for
approximating $C^n$ functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}^d$ by
complex-valued neural networks that employ the modReLU activation function,
given by $\sigma(z) &#x3D; \mathrm{ReLU}(|z| - 1) \, \mathrm{sgn} (z)$, which is one
of the most popular complex activation functions used in practice. We show that
the derived approximation rates are optimal (up to log factors) in the class of
modReLU networks with weights of moderate growth.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new quantum state reconstruction method that combines ideas from
compressed sensing, non-convex optimization, and acceleration methods. The
algorithm, called Momentum-Inspired Factored Gradient Descent (\texttt{MiFGD}),
extends the applicability of quantum tomography for larger systems. Despite
being a non-convex method, \texttt{MiFGD} converges \emph{provably} to the true
density matrix at a linear rate, in the absence of experimental and statistical
noise, and under common assumptions. With this manuscript, we present the
method, prove its convergence property and provide Frobenius norm bound
guarantees with respect to the true density matrix. From a practical point of
view, we benchmark the algorithm performance with respect to other existing
methods, in both synthetic and real experiments performed on an IBM&#x27;s quantum
processing unit. We find that the proposed algorithm performs orders of
magnitude faster than state of the art approaches, with the same or better
accuracy. In both synthetic and real experiments, we observed accurate and
robust reconstruction, despite experimental and statistical noise in the
tomographic data. Finally, we provide a ready-to-use code for state tomography
of multi-qubit systems.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have amply demonstrated their prowess but estimating the
reliability of their predictions remains challenging. Deep Ensembles are widely
considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty
estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another
popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our
central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like
models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first
uses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the
second relies on a finite number of independent models.

To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of
randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a
fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to
change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the
overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal
configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to
implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the
cost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets,
CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</span>

                                        <span>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is essential for understanding
customer&#x27;s power consumption patterns and may find wide applications like
carbon emission reduction and energy conservation. The training of NILM models
requires massive load data containing different types of appliances. However,
inadequate load data and the risk of power consumer privacy breaches may be
encountered by local data owners during the NILM model training. To prevent
such potential risks, a novel NILM method named Fed-NILM which is based on
Federated Learning (FL) is proposed in this paper. In Fed-NILM, local model
parameters instead of local load data are shared among multiple data owners.
The global model is obtained by weighted averaging the parameters. Experiments
based on two measured load datasets are conducted to explore the generalization
ability of Fed-NILM. Besides, a comparison of Fed-NILM with locally-trained
NILMs and the centrally-trained NILM is conducted. The experimental results
show that Fed-NILM has superior performance in scalability and convergence.
Fed-NILM outperforms locally-trained NILMs operated by local data owners and
approximates the centrally-trained NILM which is trained on the entire load
dataset without privacy protection. The proposed Fed-NILM significantly
improves the co-modeling capabilities of local data owners while protecting
power consumers&#x27; privacy.</span>

                                        <span>Following the great success of Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), in many research domains in 2010s, several ML-based approaches
were proposed for detection in large inverse linear problems, e.g., massive
MIMO systems. The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum
A-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.
Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly
different approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of
disCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and
continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete
MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding
into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters
to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent
DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet
based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate
probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft
decoding in today&#x27;s communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO
systems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off
compared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet&#x27;s soft outputs to
be reliable for decoders.</span>

                                        <span>Projection algorithms such as t-SNE or UMAP are useful for the visualization
of high dimensional data, but depend on hyperparameters which must be tuned
carefully. Unfortunately, iteratively recomputing projections to find the
optimal hyperparameter value is computationally intensive and unintuitive due
to the stochastic nature of these methods. In this paper we propose HyperNP, a
scalable method that allows for real-time interactive hyperparameter
exploration of projection methods by training neural network approximations.
HyperNP can be trained on a fraction of the total data instances and
hyperparameter configurations and can compute projections for new data and
hyperparameters at interactive speeds. HyperNP is compact in size and fast to
compute, thus allowing it to be embedded in lightweight visualization systems
such as web browsers. We evaluate the performance of the HyperNP across three
datasets in terms of performance and speed. The results suggest that HyperNP is
accurate, scalable, interactive, and appropriate for use in real-world
settings.</span>

and learning from them is a long-standing goal in machine learning research.
However, existing self-supervised generative models approximating an ELBO are
not able to fulfill all desired requirements of multimodal models: their
posterior approximation functions lead to a trade-off between the semantic
coherence and the ability to learn the joint data distribution. We propose a
new, generalized ELBO formulation for multimodal data that overcomes these
limitations. The new objective encompasses two previous methods as special
cases and combines their benefits without compromises. In extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method compared to
state-of-the-art models in self-supervised, generative learning tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems learn generalised, interpretable
rules in a data-efficient manner utilising existing background knowledge.
However, current ILP systems require training examples to be specified in a
structured logical format. Neural networks learn from unstructured data,
although their learned models may be difficult to interpret and are vulnerable
to data perturbations at run-time. This paper introduces a hybrid
neural-symbolic learning framework, called NSL, that learns interpretable rules
from labelled unstructured data. NSL combines pre-trained neural networks for
feature extraction with FastLAS, a state-of-the-art ILP system for rule
learning under the answer set semantics. Features extracted by the neural
components define the structured context of labelled examples and the
confidence of the neural predictions determines the level of noise of the
examples. Using the scoring function of FastLAS, NSL searches for short,
interpretable rules that generalise over such noisy examples. We evaluate our
framework on propositional and first-order classification tasks using the MNIST
dataset as raw data. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSL is able to learn
robust rules from perturbed MNIST data and achieve comparable or superior
accuracy when compared to neural network and random forest baselines whilst
being more general and interpretable.</span>

adaptive behaviour in fields ranging from machine learning, to biology, to
economics. While many approaches have been taken, one approach to solving this
trade-off has been to equip or propose that agents possess an intrinsic
&#x27;exploratory drive&#x27; which is often implemented in terms of maximizing the
agents information gain about the world -- an approach which has been widely
studied in machine learning and cognitive science. In this paper we
mathematically investigate the nature and meaning of such approaches and
demonstrate that this combination of utility maximizing and information-seeking
behaviour arises from the minimization of an entirely difference class of
objectives we call divergence objectives. We propose a dichotomy in the
objective functions underlying adaptive behaviour between \emph{evidence}
objectives, which correspond to well-known reward or utility maximizing
objectives in the literature, and \emph{divergence} objectives which instead
seek to minimize the divergence between the agent&#x27;s expected and desired
futures, and argue that this new class of divergence objectives could form the
mathematical foundation for a much richer understanding of the exploratory
components of adaptive and intelligent action, beyond simply greedy utility
maximization.</span>

                                        <span>Family history is a major risk factor for many types of cancer. Mendelian
risk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions
based on knowledge of cancer susceptibility genes. These models are widely used
in clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models
leverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about
cancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to
validate due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as
neural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to
accuracy gains. In this paper, we develop a framework to apply neural networks
to family history data and investigate their ability to learn inherited
susceptibility to cancer. While there is an extensive literature on neural
networks and their state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, there is little
work applying them to family history data. We propose adaptations of
fully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to pedigrees.
In data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed
neural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction
performance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported
cancer diagnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO
model embedding the correct inheritance laws. Using a large dataset of over
200,000 family histories, the Risk Service cohort, we train prediction models
for future risk of breast cancer. We validate the models using data from the
Cancer Genetics Network.</span>

                                        <span>Slimmable neural networks provide a flexible trade-off front between
prediction error and computational requirement (such as the number of
floating-point operations or FLOPs) with the same storage requirement as a
single model. They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying
models to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for
optimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing
slimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or
optimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby
leaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight
optimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint
optimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.
Our framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special
cases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a
practical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes
both the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing
methods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,
and objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering
FLOPs and memory footprint, respectively. Our results highlight the potential
of optimizing the channel counts for different layers jointly with the weights
for slimmable networks. Code available at https://github.com/cmu-enyac/Joslim.</span>

                                        <span>Graphs have been widely used in data mining and machine learning due to their
unique representation of real-world objects and their interactions. As graphs
are getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs
separately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is
natural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local
system holding a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the
whole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively
train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing
their graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of
subgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage,
which trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link
structures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which
trains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links
across local subgraphs. Empirical results on four real-world graph datasets
with synthesized subgraph federated learning settings demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques. At the same time,
consistent theoretical implications are made towards their generalization
ability on the global graphs.</span>

                                        <span>Inspired by a new coded computation algorithm for invertible functions, we
propose Coded-InvNet a new approach to design resilient prediction serving
systems that can gracefully handle stragglers or node failures. Coded-InvNet
leverages recent findings in the deep learning literature such as invertible
neural networks, Manifold Mixup, and domain translation algorithms, identifying
interesting research directions that span across machine learning and systems.
Our experimental results show that Coded-InvNet can outperform existing
approaches, especially when the compute resource overhead is as low as 10%. For
instance, without knowing which of the ten workers is going to fail, our
algorithm can design a backup task so that it can correctly recover the missing
prediction result with an accuracy of 85.9%, significantly outperforming the
previous SOTA by 32.5%.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of recovering an unknown signal $\boldsymbol x$ given
measurements obtained from a generalized linear model with a Gaussian sensing
matrix. Two popular solutions are based on a linear estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm L}$ and a spectral estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$. The former
is a data-dependent linear combination of the columns of the measurement
matrix, and its analysis is quite simple. The latter is the principal
eigenvector of a data-dependent matrix, and a recent line of work has studied
its performance. In this paper, we show how to optimally combine
$\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$. At the heart
of our analysis is the exact characterization of the joint empirical
distribution of $(\boldsymbol x, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}, \hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm s})$ in the high-dimensional limit. This allows us to compute the
Bayes-optimal combination of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and
$\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$, given the limiting distribution of the signal
$\boldsymbol x$. When the distribution of the signal is Gaussian, then the
Bayes-optimal combination has the form $\theta\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm
L}+\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$ and we derive the optimal combination
coefficient. In order to establish the limiting distribution of $(\boldsymbol
x, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s})$, we design and
analyze an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm whose iterates give
$\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and approach $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the improvement of the proposed combination
with respect to the two methods considered separately.</span>

analysis reveals crucial information for understanding the underlying
processes. Among the many time series learning tasks of great importance, we
here focus on semi-supervised learning based on a graph representation of the
data. Two main aspects are involved in this task. A suitable distance measure
to evaluate the similarities between time series, and a learning method to make
predictions based on these distances. However, the relationship between the two
aspects has never been studied systematically in the context of graph-based
learning. We describe four different distance measures, including (Soft) DTW
and MPDist, a distance measure based on the Matrix Profile, as well as four
successful semi-supervised learning methods, including the graph Allen--Cahn
method and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network. We then compare the
performance of the algorithms on binary classification data sets. In our
findings we compare the chosen graph-based methods using all distance measures
and observe that the results vary strongly with respect to the accuracy. As
predicted by the &#x60;&#x60;no free lunch&#x27;&#x27; theorem, no clear best combination to employ
in all cases is found. Our study provides a reproducible framework for future
work in the direction of semi-supervised learning for time series with a focus

may not fully exploit the feature structure. In this paper, we incorporate the
grouping effect into MF and propose a novel method called Robust Matrix
Factorization with Grouping effect (GRMF). The grouping effect is a
generalization of the sparsity effect, which conducts denoising by clustering
similar values around multiple centers instead of just around 0. Compared with
existing algorithms, the proposed GRMF can automatically learn the grouping
structure and sparsity in MF without prior knowledge, by introducing a
naturally adjustable non-convex regularization to achieve simultaneous sparsity
and grouping effect. Specifically, GRMF uses an efficient alternating
minimization framework to perform MF, in which the original non-convex problem
is first converted into a convex problem through Difference-of-Convex (DC)
programming, and then solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). In addition, GRMF can be easily extended to the Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted using
real-world data sets with outliers and contaminated noise, where the
experimental results show that GRMF has promoted performance and robustness,
compared to five benchmark algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Recent years have witnessed fast growth in outdoor location-based services.
While GPS is considered a ubiquitous localization system, it is not supported
by low-end phones, requires direct line of sight to the satellites, and can
drain the phone battery quickly.

In this paper, we propose DeepLoc: a deep learning-based outdoor localization
system that obtains GPS-like localization accuracy without its limitations. In
particular, DeepLoc leverages the ubiquitous cellular signals received from the
different cell towers heard by the mobile device as hints to localize it. To do
that, crowd-sensed geo-tagged received signal strength information coming from
different cell towers is used to train a deep model that is used to infer the
user&#x27;s position. As part of DeepLoc design, we introduce modules to address a
number of practical challenges including scaling the data collection to large
areas, handling the inherent noise in the cellular signal and geo-tagged data,
as well as providing enough data that is required for deep learning models with
low-overhead.

We implemented DeepLoc on different Android devices. Evaluation results in
realistic urban and rural environments show that DeepLoc can achieve a median
localization accuracy within 18.8m in urban areas and within 15.7m in rural
areas. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art cellular-based systems by
more than 470% and comes with 330% savings in power compared to the GPS. This
highlights the promise of DeepLoc as a ubiquitous accurate and low-overhead
localization system.</span>

Vision-based Graph Aggregation and Inference (VGAI). This multi-agent
decentralized learning-to-control framework maps raw visual observations to
agent actions, aided by local communication among neighboring agents. Our
framework is implemented by a cascade of a convolutional and a graph neural
network (CNN / GNN), addressing agent-level visual perception and feature
learning, as well as swarm-level communication, local information aggregation
and agent action inference, respectively. By jointly training the CNN and GNN,
image features and communication messages are learned in conjunction to better
address the specific task. We use imitation learning to train the VGAI
controller in an offline phase, relying on a centralized expert controller.
This results in a learned VGAI controller that can be deployed in a distributed
manner for online execution. Additionally, the controller exhibits good scaling
properties, with training in smaller teams and application in larger teams.
Through a multi-agent flocking application, we demonstrate that VGAI yields
performance comparable to or better than other decentralized controllers, using
only the visual input modality and without accessing precise location or motion
state information.</span>

information (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can
derive multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can
split a sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the
sequence. Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a
strong underestimation bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose
decomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation
problems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed
subviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between the decomposed views.
This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each
measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via
contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound
on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our
general approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show
that DEMI can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed
contrastive bounds in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in
a vision domain and for dialogue generation.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) appear to be state-of-the-art
algorithms for analyzing non-euclidean graph data. By applying deep-learning to
extract high-level representations from graph structures, GNNs achieve
extraordinary accuracy and great generalization ability in various tasks.
However, with the ever-increasing graph sizes, more and more complicated GNN
layers, and higher feature dimensions, the computational complexity of GNNs
grows exponentially. How to inference GNNs in real time has become a
challenging problem, especially for some resource-limited edge-computing
platforms.

To tackle this challenge, we propose BlockGNN, a software-hardware co-design
approach to realize efficient GNN acceleration. At the algorithm level, we
propose to leverage block-circulant weight matrices to greatly reduce the
complexity of various GNN models. At the hardware design level, we propose a
pipelined CirCore architecture, which supports efficient block-circulant
matrices computation. Basing on CirCore, we present a novel BlockGNN
accelerator to compute various GNNs with low latency. Moreover, to determine
the optimal configurations for diverse deployed tasks, we also introduce a
performance and resource model that helps choose the optimal hardware
parameters automatically. Comprehensive experiments on the ZC706 FPGA platform
demonstrate that on various GNN tasks, BlockGNN achieves up to $8.3\times$
speedup compared to the baseline HyGCN architecture and $111.9\times$ energy
reduction compared to the Intel Xeon CPU platform.</span>

often trained with anechoic data. However, real acoustic environments are
generally reverberant, which causes the performance to significantly
deteriorate. To mitigate this mismatch between training data and real data, we
simulate an augmented training set that contains nearly five million
utterances. This extension comprises of anechoic utterances and their
reverberant modifications, generated by convolutions of the anechoic utterances
with a variety of room impulse responses (RIRs). We consider five different
models to generate RIRs, and five different VADs that are trained with the
augmented training set. We test all trained systems in three different real
reverberant environments. Experimental results show $20\%$ increase on average
in accuracy, precision and recall for all detectors and response models,
compared to anechoic training. Furthermore, one of the RIR models consistently
yields better performance than the other models, for all the tested VADs.
Additionally, one of the VADs consistently outperformed the other VADs in all
experiments.</span>

                                        <span>High-impedance faults (HIF) are difficult to detect because of their low
current amplitude and highly diverse characteristics. In recent years, machine
learning (ML) has been gaining popularity in HIF detection because ML
techniques learn patterns from data and successfully detect HIFs. However, as
these methods are based on supervised learning, they fail to reliably detect
any scenario, fault or non-fault, not present in the training data.
Consequently, this paper takes advantage of unsupervised learning and proposes
a convolutional autoencoder framework for HIF detection (CAE-HIFD). Contrary to
the conventional autoencoders that learn from normal behavior, the
convolutional autoencoder (CAE) in CAE-HIFD learns only from the HIF signals
eliminating the need for presence of diverse non-HIF scenarios in the CAE
training. CAE distinguishes HIFs from non-HIF operating conditions by employing
cross-correlation. To discriminate HIFs from transient disturbances such as
capacitor or load switching, CAE-HIFD uses kurtosis, a statistical measure of
the probability distribution shape. The performance evaluation studies
conducted using the IEEE 13-node test feeder indicate that the CAE-HIFD
reliably detects HIFs, outperforms the state-of-the-art HIF detection
techniques, and is robust against noise.</span>

                                        <span>Inferential (or soft) sensors are used in industry to infer the values of
imprecisely and rarely measured (or completely unmeasured) variables from
variables measured online (e.g., pressures, temperatures). The main challenge,
akin to classical model overfitting, in designing an effective inferential
sensor is the selection of a correct structure of the sensor. The sensor
structure is represented by the number of inputs to the sensor, which
correspond to the variables measured online and their (simple) combinations.
This work is focused on the design of inferential sensors for product
composition of an industrial distillation column in two oil refinery units, a
Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit and a Vacuum Gasoil Hydrogenation unit. As the
first design step, we use several well-known data pre-treatment (gross error
detection) methods and compare the ability of these approaches to indicate
systematic errors and outliers in the available industrial data. We then study
effectiveness of various methods for design of the inferential sensors taking
into account the complexity and accuracy of the resulting model. The
effectiveness analysis indicates that the improvements achieved over the
current inferential sensors are up to 19 %.</span>

simultaneously, and it solves one big optimization problem with the ascertained

consistently exhibit known human social biases. Although many methods for
debiasing exist, almost all fixate on completely eliminating biased information
from the embeddings and often diminish training set size in the process. In
this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for debiasing GloVe word
embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) which works by incorporating explicit
information about training set bias rather than removing biased data outright.
Our method runs quickly and efficiently with the help of a fast bias gradient
approximation method from Brunet et al. (2019). As our approach is akin to the
notion of &#x27;source criticism&#x27; in the humanities, we term our method
Source-Critical GloVe (SC-GloVe). We show that SC-GloVe reduces the effect size

the echo path from the far-end signal to the near-end microphone in two parts.
Inspired by the physical behavior of modern hands-free devices, we first
introduce a novel neural network architecture that is specifically designed to
model the nonlinear distortions these devices induce between receiving and
playing the far-end signal. To account for variations between devices, we
construct this network with trainable memory length and nonlinear activation
functions that are not parameterized in advance, but are rather optimized
during the training stage using the training data. Second, the network is
succeeded by a standard adaptive linear filter that constantly tracks the echo
path between the loudspeaker output and the microphone. During training, the
network and filter are jointly optimized to learn the network parameters. This
system requires 17 thousand parameters that consume 500 Million floating-point
operations per second and 40 Kilo-bytes of memory. It also satisfies hands-free
communication timing requirements on a standard neural processor, which renders
it adequate for embedding on hands-free communication devices. Using 280 hours
of real and synthetic data, experiments show advantageous performance compared

of quasars from the recently completed extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). The sample contains $343708$ objects in the
redshift range $0.8&lt;z&lt;2.2$ and $72667$ objects with redshifts $2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5$,
covering an effective area of $4699~{\rm deg}^{2}$. We develop a neural
network-based approach to mitigate spurious fluctuations in the density field
caused by spatial variations in the quality of the imaging data used to select
targets for follow-up spectroscopy. Simulations are used with the same angular
and radial distributions as the real data to estimate covariance matrices,
perform error analyses, and assess residual systematic uncertainties. We
measure the mean density contrast and cross-correlations of the eBOSS quasars
against maps of potential sources of imaging systematics to address algorithm
effectiveness, finding that the neural network-based approach outperforms
standard linear regression. Stellar density is one of the most important
sources of spurious fluctuations, and a new template constructed using data
from the Gaia spacecraft provides the best match to the observed quasar
clustering. The end-product from this work is a new value-added quasar
catalogue with the improved weights to correct for nonlinear imaging systematic
effects, which will be made public. Our quasar catalogue is used to measure the
local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in our companion paper, Mueller et al. in
preparation.</span>

                                        <span>Although the optimization objectives for learning neural networks are highly
non-convex, gradient-based methods have been wildly successful at learning
neural networks in practice. This juxtaposition has led to a number of recent
studies on provable guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent.
Unfortunately, the techniques in these works are often highly specific to the
problem studied in each setting, relying on different assumptions on the
distribution, optimization parameters, and network architectures, making it
difficult to generalize across different settings. In this work, we propose a
unified non-convex optimization framework for the analysis of neural network
training. We introduce the notions of proxy convexity and proxy
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequalities, which are satisfied if the original
objective function induces a proxy objective function that is implicitly
minimized when using gradient methods. We show that stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) on objectives satisfying proxy convexity or the proxy PL inequality leads
to efficient guarantees for proxy objective functions. We further show that
many existing guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent can be
unified through proxy convexity and proxy PL inequalities.</span>

and stationary noises, which often occur in real life scenarios. We exploit
unique spatial patterns of speech and non-speech audio frames by independently
learning their underlying geometric structure. This process is done through a
deep encoder-decoder based neural network architecture. This structure involves
an encoder that maps spectral features with temporal information to their
low-dimensional representations, which are generated by applying the diffusion
maps method. The encoder feeds a decoder that maps the embedded data back into
the high-dimensional space. A deep neural network, which is trained to separate
speech from non-speech frames, is obtained by concatenating the decoder to the
encoder, resembling the known Diffusion nets architecture. Experimental results
show enhanced performance compared to competing voice activity detection
methods. The improvement is achieved in both accuracy, robustness and
generalization ability. Our model performs in a real-time manner and can be
integrated into audio-based communication systems. We also present a batch
algorithm which obtains an even higher accuracy for off-line applications.</span>

challenge is that the isotropic noise typically added for privacy dominates the
signal in gradient geometry for high-dimensional problems; approaches to this
that effectively optimize over lower-dimensional subspaces simply ignore the
actual problems that varying gradient geometries introduce. In contrast, we
study non-isotropic clipping and noise addition, developing a principled

                                        <span>Temporal graph signals are multivariate time series with individual
components associated with nodes of a fixed graph structure. Data of this kind
arises in many domains including activity of social network users, sensor
network readings over time, and time course gene expression within the
interaction network of a model organism. Traditional matrix decomposition
methods applied to such data fall short of exploiting structural regularities
encoded in the underlying graph and also in the temporal patterns of the
signal. How can we take into account such structure to obtain a succinct and
interpretable representation of temporal graph signals?

We propose a general, dictionary-based framework for temporal graph signal
decomposition (TGSD). The key idea is to learn a low-rank, joint encoding of
the data via a combination of graph and time dictionaries. We propose a highly
scalable decomposition algorithm for both complete and incomplete data, and
demonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing
values, temporal interpolation, clustering, period estimation, and rank
estimation in synthetic and real-world data ranging from traffic patterns to
social media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to
baselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations
are missing. It scales best among baselines taking under 20 seconds on 3.5
million data points and produces the most parsimonious models. To the best of
our knowledge, TGSD is the first framework to jointly model graph signals by
temporal and graph dictionaries.</span>

                                        <span>Regularization plays a vital role in machine learning optimization. One novel
regularization method called flooding makes the training loss fluctuate around
the flooding level. It intends to make the model continue to random walk until
it comes to a flat loss landscape to enhance generalization. However, the
hyper-parameter flooding level of the flooding method fails to be selected
properly and uniformly. We propose a novel method called Jitter to improve it.
Jitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we
randomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The
flooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target
function and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random
factor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is
consistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the
learning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the
model more robust. In addition, Jitter performs random walk randomly which
divides the loss curve into small intervals and then flipping them over,
ideally making the loss curve much flatter and enhancing generalization
ability. Moreover, Jitter can be a domain-, task-, and model-independent
regularization method and train the model effectively after the training error
reduces to zero. Our experimental results show that Jitter method can improve
model performance more significantly than the previous flooding method and make
the test loss curve descend twice.</span>

controllable inductive biases by using an intermediary set of latent variables.
This allows us to overcome the limitations of the standard Gaussian prior
assumption. In particular, it allows us to impose desired properties like
sparsity or clustering on learned representations, and incorporate prior
information into the learned model. Our approach, which we refer to as the
Intermediary Latent Space VAE (InteL-VAE), is based around controlling the
stochasticity of the encoding process with the intermediary latent variables,
before deterministically mapping them forward to our target latent
representation, from which reconstruction is performed. This allows us to
maintain all the advantages of the traditional VAE framework, while
incorporating desired prior information, inductive biases, and even topological
information through the latent mapping. We show that this, in turn, allows
InteL-VAEs to learn both better generative models and representations.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a theoretical approach towards the training numerical stability of
Variational AutoEncoders (VAE). Our work is motivated by recent studies
empowering VAEs to reach state of the art generative results on complex image
datasets. These very deep VAE architectures, as well as VAEs using more complex
output distributions, highlight a tendency to haphazardly produce high training
gradients as well as NaN losses. The empirical fixes proposed to train them
despite their limitations are neither fully theoretically grounded nor
generally sufficient in practice. Building on this, we localize the source of
the problem at the interface between the model&#x27;s neural networks and their
output probabilistic distributions. We explain a common source of instability
stemming from an incautious formulation of the encoded Normal distribution&#x27;s
variance, and apply the same approach on other, less obvious sources. We show
that by implementing small changes to the way we parameterize the Normal
distributions on which they rely, VAEs can securely be trained.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in whole slide imaging (WSI) technology have led to the
development of a myriad of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)
based diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive algorithms. Computational
Pathology (CPath) offers an integrated solution to utilize information embedded
in pathology WSIs beyond what we obtain through visual assessment. For
automated analysis of WSIs and validation of machine learning (ML) models,
annotations at the slide, tissue and cellular levels are required. The
annotation of important visual constructs in pathology images is an important
component of CPath projects. Improper annotations can result in algorithms
which are hard to interpret and can potentially produce inaccurate and
inconsistent results. Despite the crucial role of annotations in CPath
projects, there are no well-defined guidelines or best practices on how
annotations should be carried out. In this paper, we address this shortcoming
by presenting the experience and best practices acquired during the execution
of a large-scale annotation exercise involving a multidisciplinary team of
pathologists, ML experts and researchers as part of the Pathology image data
Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) consortium. We present a
real-world case study along with examples of different types of annotations,
diagnostic algorithm, annotation data dictionary and annotation constructs. The
analyses reported in this work highlight best practice recommendations that can
be used as annotation guidelines over the lifecycle of a CPath project.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate modeling of boundary conditions is crucial in computational physics.
The ever increasing use of neural networks as surrogates for physics-related
problems calls for an improved understanding of boundary condition treatment,
and its influence on the network accuracy. In this paper, several strategies to
impose boundary conditions (namely padding, improved spatial context, and
explicit encoding of physical boundaries) are investigated in the context of
fully convolutional networks applied to recurrent tasks. These strategies are
evaluated on two spatio-temporal evolving problems modeled by partial
differential equations: the 2D propagation of acoustic waves (hyperbolic PDE)
and the heat equation (parabolic PDE). Results reveal a high sensitivity of
both accuracy and stability on the boundary implementation in such recurrent
tasks. It is then demonstrated that the choice of the optimal padding strategy
is directly linked to the data semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of
additional input spatial context or explicit physics-based rules allows a
better handling of boundaries in particular for large number of recurrences,
resulting in more robust and stable neural networks, while facilitating the
design and versatility of such networks.</span>

                                        <span>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its
detection. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art studies focused on glaucoma
detection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for
glaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a
new OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning
algorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted
features related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an
innovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual
and attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The
proposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot
learning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm
is redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides
substantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced
glaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic
prototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via
Heidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a
categorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.
Besides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma
detection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation
maps are directly in line with the clinicians&#x27; opinion since the heatmaps
pointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning based molecular graph generation and optimization has recently
been attracting attention due to its great potential for de novo drug design.
On the one hand, recent models are able to efficiently learn a given graph
distribution, and many approaches have proven very effective to produce a
molecule that maximizes a given score. On the other hand, it was shown by
previous studies that generated optimized molecules are often unrealistic, even
with the inclusion of mechanics to enforce similarity to a dataset of real drug
molecules. In this work we use a hybrid approach, where the dataset
distribution is learned using an autoregressive model while the score
optimization is done using the Metropolis algorithm, biased toward the learned
distribution. We show that the resulting method, that we call learned realism
sampling (LRS), produces empirically more realistic molecules and outperforms
all recent baselines in the task of molecule optimization with similarity
constraints.</span>

mixture of two isotropic distributions satisfying concentration and
anti-concentration properties enjoyed by log-concave distributions among
others. We show that there exists a universal constant $C_{\mathrm{err}}&gt;0$
such that if a pseudolabeler $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mathrm{pl}}$ can achieve
classification error at most $C_{\mathrm{err}}$, then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$,
an iterative self-training algorithm initialized at $\boldsymbol{\beta}_0 :&#x3D;
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mathrm{pl}}$ using pseudolabels $\hat y &#x3D;
\mathrm{sgn}(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_t, \mathbf{x}\rangle)$ and using at
most $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon^2)$ unlabeled examples suffices to learn the
Bayes-optimal classifier up to $\varepsilon$ error, where $d$ is the ambient
dimension. That is, self-training converts weak learners to strong learners
using only unlabeled examples. We additionally show that by running gradient
descent on the logistic loss one can obtain a pseudolabeler
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mathrm{pl}}$ with classification error $C_{\mathrm{err}}$
using only $O(d)$ labeled examples (i.e., independent of $\varepsilon$).
Together our results imply that mixture models can be learned to within
$\varepsilon$ of the Bayes-optimal accuracy using at most $O(d)$ labeled
examples and $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon^2)$ unlabeled examples by way of a

Classification based on Purpose competition. The goal of the competition is to
classify a citation in a scientific article based on its purpose. This task is
important because it could potentially lead to more comprehensive ways of
summarizing the purpose and uses of scientific articles, but it is also
difficult, mainly due to the limited amount of available training data in which
the purposes of each citation have been hand-labeled, along with the
subjectivity of these labels. Our entry in the competition is a multi-task
model that combines multiple modules designed to handle the problem from
different perspectives, including hand-generated linguistic features, TF-IDF
features, and an LSTM-with-attention model. We also provide an ablation study
and feature analysis whose insights could lead to future work.</span>

                                        <span>While predictive policing has become increasingly common in assisting with
decisions in the criminal justice system, the use of these results is still
controversial. Some software based on deep learning lacks accuracy (e.g., in
F-1), and many decision processes are not transparent causing doubt about
decision bias, such as perceived racial, age, and gender disparities. This
paper addresses bias issues with post-hoc explanations to provide a trustable
prediction of whether a person will receive future criminal charges given one&#x27;s
previous criminal records by learning temporal behavior patterns over twenty
years. Bi-LSTM relieves the vanishing gradient problem, and attentional
mechanisms allows learning and interpretation of feature importance. Our
approach shows consistent and reliable prediction precision and recall on a
real-life dataset. Our analysis of the importance of each input feature shows
the critical causal impact on decision-making, suggesting that criminal
histories are statistically significant factors, while identifiers, such as
race, gender, and age, are not. Finally, our algorithm indicates that a suspect
tends to gradually rather than suddenly increase crime severity level over
time.</span>

                                        <span>The phenomenon of adversarial examples in deep learning models has caused
substantial concern over their reliability. While many deep neural networks
have shown impressive performance in terms of predictive accuracy, it has been
shown that in many instances an imperceptible perturbation can falsely flip the
network&#x27;s prediction. Most research has then focused on developing defenses
against adversarial attacks or learning under a worst-case adversarial loss. In
this work, we take a step back and aim to provide a framework for determining
whether a model&#x27;s label change under small perturbation is justified (and when
it is not). We carefully argue that adversarial robustness should be defined as
a locally adaptive measure complying with the underlying distribution. We then
suggest a definition for an adaptive robust loss, derive an empirical version
of it, and develop a resulting data-augmentation framework. We prove that our
adaptive data-augmentation maintains consistency of 1-nearest neighbor
classification under deterministic labels and provide illustrative empirical
evaluations.</span>

parameterised collection of fast-to-run toy environments in \textit{OpenAI Gym}
by varying these dimensions and propose to use these for the initial design and
development of agents. We also provide wrappers that inject these dimensions
into complex environments from \textit{Atari} and \textit{Mujoco} to allow for

there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To
enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph
neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties
and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all
existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal
performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural
network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph
neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network
layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently
learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new
connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep
learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture
utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant
modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the
performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date
involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that
represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The
results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either
match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested
datasets. Our implementation and dataset will be released upon acceptance.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning has emerged as an important paradigm for training machine
learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph
classification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples,
which can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other
domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may
benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as
the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards
such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm
that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically
significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different
sets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID
regarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a
graph clustering federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds
clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically
justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity
among graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of
GNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering,
and design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time
warping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of online classification under a privacy constraint.
In this setting a learner observes sequentially a stream of labelled examples
$(x_t, y_t)$, for $1 \leq t \leq T$, and returns at each iteration $t$ a
hypothesis $h_t$ which is used to predict the label of each new example $x_t$.
The learner&#x27;s performance is measured by her regret against a known hypothesis
class $\mathcal{H}$. We require that the algorithm satisfies the following
privacy constraint: the sequence $h_1, \ldots, h_T$ of hypotheses output by the
algorithm needs to be an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private function
of the whole input sequence $(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_T, y_T)$. We provide the
first non-trivial regret bound for the realizable setting. Specifically, we
show that if the class $\mathcal{H}$ has constant Littlestone dimension then,
given an oblivious sequence of labelled examples, there is a private learner
that makes in expectation at most $O(\log T)$ mistakes -- comparable to the
optimal mistake bound in the non-private case, up to a logarithmic factor.
Moreover, for general values of the Littlestone dimension $d$, the same mistake
bound holds but with a doubly-exponential in $d$ factor. A recent line of work
has demonstrated a strong connection between classes that are online learnable
and those that are differentially-private learnable. Our results strengthen
this connection and show that an online learning algorithm can in fact be
directly privatized (in the realizable setting). We also discuss an adaptive
setting and provide a sublinear regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$.</span>

                                        <span>The fundamental task of classification given a limited number of training
data samples is considered for physical systems with known parametric
statistical models. The standalone learning-based and statistical model-based
classifiers face major challenges towards the fulfillment of the classification
task using a small training set. Specifically, classifiers that solely rely on
the physics-based statistical models usually suffer from their inability to
properly tune the underlying unobservable parameters, which leads to a
mismatched representation of the system&#x27;s behaviors. Learning-based
classifiers, on the other hand, typically rely on a large number of training
data from the underlying physical process, which might not be feasible in most
practical scenarios. In this paper, a hybrid classification method -- termed
HyPhyLearn -- is proposed that exploits both the physics-based statistical
models and the learning-based classifiers. The proposed solution is based on
the conjecture that HyPhyLearn would alleviate the challenges associated with
the individual approaches of learning-based and statistical model-based
classifiers by fusing their respective strengths. The proposed hybrid approach
first estimates the unobservable model parameters using the available
(suboptimal) statistical estimation procedures, and subsequently use the
physics-based statistical models to generate synthetic data. Then, the training
data samples are incorporated with the synthetic data in a learning-based
classifier that is based on domain-adversarial training of neural networks.
Specifically, in order to address the mismatch problem, the classifier learns a
mapping from the training data and the synthetic data to a common feature
space. Simultaneously, the classifier is trained to find discriminative
features within this space in order to fulfill the classification task.</span>

functionalities to a user. Such automation is enabled by the &#x60;Turing-complete&#x27;
nature of the programming language (Solidity) in which SCs are written. This
also opens up different vulnerabilities and bugs in SCs that malicious actors
exploit to carry out malicious or illegal activities on the cryptocurrency
platform. In this work, we study the correlation between malicious activities
and the vulnerabilities present in SCs and find that some malicious activities
are correlated with certain types of vulnerabilities. We then develop and study
the feasibility of a scoring mechanism that corresponds to the severity of the
vulnerabilities present in SCs to determine if it is a relevant feature to
identify suspicious SCs. We analyze the utility of severity score towards
detection of suspicious SCs using unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms
across different temporal granularities and identify behavioral changes. In our
experiments with on-chain SCs, we were able to find a total of 1094 benign SCs
across different granularities which behave similar to malicious SCs, with the

                                        <span>Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive
gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most
pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web.
A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by
starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this
assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as
biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial
gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To
facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP
benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that
domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of
biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board.
Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for
pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common
practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging
schemes in named entity recognition (NER). To help accelerate research in
biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and
task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our
BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding &amp; Reasoning
Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.</span>

order to learn successful policies for perception-based mobile navigation.
However, gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively
expensive. Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with
possibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data
collection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such
heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt
learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt
integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the
integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models
allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different
platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot
at test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms
conventional hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer
vision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with
self-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers
(ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and
have not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a
further step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision
tasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for
the optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a
new effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that
architectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads,
width, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to
cater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \textit{private}
class token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to
adapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling
probability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS
attains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures.
For example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves
$74.7\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\%$ superior than the current
baseline ViT architecture. Code is available at

                                        <span>Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS)
applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain
under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate the
use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term
Memory-based, Domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress
estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate
independent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout
the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for
the period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth.
State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and
dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The
DgNN had a 3.5% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 33%
more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the other NNs during test years.
The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop
progress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for
all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop
growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this
study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE)
and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here
can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.</span>

availability/perception (IAP) of alternatives and proposes a variational
autoencoder (VAE) approach for choice set generation and implicit perception of
alternatives. Specifically, the cross-nested logit (CNL) model with IAP is
derived as an example of IAP-GEV models. The VAE approach is adapted to model
the choice set generation process, in which the likelihood of perceiving chosen
alternatives in the choice set is maximized. The VAE approach for route choice
set generation is exemplified using a real dataset. IAP- CNL model estimated
has the best performance in terms of goodness-of-fit and prediction
performance, compared to multinomial logit models and conventional choice set
generation methods.</span>

                                        <span>We present a new second-order oracle bound for the expected risk of a
weighted majority vote. The bound is based on a novel parametric form of the
Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality (a.k.a.\ one-sided Chebyshev&#x27;s), which is
amenable to efficient minimization. The new form resolves the optimization
challenge faced by prior oracle bounds based on the Chebyshev-Cantelli
inequality, the C-bounds [Germain et al., 2015], and, at the same time, it
improves on the oracle bound based on second order Markov&#x27;s inequality
introduced by Masegosa et al. [2020]. We also derive the PAC-Bayes-Bennett
inequality, which we use for empirical estimation of the oracle bound. The
PAC-Bayes-Bennett inequality improves on the PAC-Bayes-Bernstein inequality by
Seldin et al. [2012]. We provide an empirical evaluation demonstrating that the
new bounds can improve on the work by Masegosa et al. [2020]. Both the
parametric form of the Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality and the PAC-Bayes-Bennett
inequality may be of independent interest for the study of concentration of

Verification (SV). In the proposed structure, the frame-level multi-task

on frame-level features in the main network for speaker classifier, with the
corresponding posterior probability for the phoneme distribution in the
auxiliary subnet. Further, the introduction of Squeeze and Excitation
(SE-block) performs dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration, which improves
the representational ability. The proposed method exploits speaker
idiosyncrasies associated with pass-phrases, and is further improved by the

                                        <span>Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for
efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable
self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively
answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered
evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to
evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority
of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling
methods.</span>

properties of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform
these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and
interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this
domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g.,
confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of
counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in
multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle
navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity
simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal
discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core
component of our work is to introduce \textit{agency}, such that it is simple
to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The
vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning
low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform
experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and
highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges

                                        <span>Binary matrix factorisation is an essential tool for identifying discrete
patterns in binary data. In this paper we consider the rank-k binary matrix
factorisation problem (k-BMF) under Boolean arithmetic: we are given an n x m
binary matrix X with possibly missing entries and need to find two binary
matrices A and B of dimension n x k and k x m respectively, which minimise the
distance between X and the Boolean product of A and B in the squared Frobenius
distance. We present a compact and two exponential size integer programs (IPs)
for k-BMF and show that the compact IP has a weak LP relaxation, while the
exponential size LPs have a stronger equivalent LP relaxation. We introduce a
new objective function, which differs from the traditional squared Frobenius
objective in attributing a weight to zero entries of the input matrix that is
proportional to the number of times the zero is erroneously covered in a rank-k
factorisation. For one of the exponential size IPs we describe a computational
approach based on column generation. Experimental results on synthetic and real
word datasets suggest that our integer programming approach is competitive
against available methods for k-BMF and provides accurate low-error
factorisations.</span>

                                        <span>One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for
which annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we
explore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to
as Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to
learn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data
distribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the
classifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the
other. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier
decision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame
and seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting
objectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)
to maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal
frames will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows
for efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a
minimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing
the data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under
different constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized
feature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via
experiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as
anomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We
also explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via
experiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.</span>

                                        <span>Prompting language models (LMs) with training examples and task descriptions
has been seen as critical to recent successes in few-shot learning. In this
work, we show that finetuning LMs in the few-shot setting can considerably
reduce the need for prompt engineering. In fact, one can use null prompts,
prompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and
achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of
tasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream
task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced:
finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than
standard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters. All in all, we
recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust
to different prompts, and can be made nearly as efficient as using frozen LMs.</span>

media, counter hate speech generation is considered as an automatic way to
tackle this challenge. The counter hate speeches are supposed to appear as a
third voice to educate people and keep the social red lines bold without
limiting the freedom of speech principles. The counter hate speech generation
is based on the optimistic assumption that, any attempt to intervene the hate
speeches in social media can play a positive role in this context. Beyond that,
previous works ignored to investigate the sequence of comments before and after
counter speech. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to
measure the counter hate speech impact from statistical point of view. In this
paper, we take the first step in this direction by measuring the counter hate
speech impact on the next comments in terms of Google Perspective Scores.
Furthermore, our experiments show that, counter hate speech can cause negative
impacts, a phenomena which is called aggression in social media.</span>

them a potentially interesting tool for interpretable machine learning. It has
been noted recently that their mechanics are closely related to neural

algorithm to simultaneously learn the structure of argumentative classification
models. To obtain a well interpretable model, the fitness function balances
sparseness and accuracy of the classifier. We discuss our algorithm and present

                                        <span>Statistical testing is widespread and critical for a variety of scientific
disciplines. The advent of machine learning and the increase of computing power
has increased the interest in the analysis and statistical testing of
multidimensional data. We extend the powerful Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample
test to a high dimensional form in a similar manner to Fasano (Fasano, 1987).
We call our result the d-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (ddKS) and provide
three novel contributions therewith: we develop an analytical equation for the
significance of a given ddKS score, we provide an algorithm for computation of
ddKS on modern computing hardware that is of constant time complexity for small
sample sizes and dimensions, and we provide two approximate calculations of
ddKS: one that reduces the time complexity to linear at larger sample sizes,
and another that reduces the time complexity to linear with increasing
dimension. We perform power analysis of ddKS and its approximations on a corpus
of datasets and compare to other common high dimensional two sample tests and
distances: Hotelling&#x27;s T^2 test and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our ddKS test
performs well for all datasets, dimensions, and sizes tested, whereas the other
tests and distances fail to reject the null hypothesis on at least one dataset.
We therefore conclude that ddKS is a powerful multidimensional two sample test
for general use, and can be calculated in a fast and efficient manner using our
parallel or approximate methods. Open source implementations of all methods
described in this work are located at https://github.com/pnnl/ddks.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning for building energy prediction has exploded in popularity in
recent years, yet understanding its limitations and potential for improvement
are lacking. The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition
was the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held
with 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set
included two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam
readings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper
analyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an
aggregation of the competition&#x27;s top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the
limitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical
meter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified
according to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus
gradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on
single buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The
results show machine learning models have errors within a range of
acceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in
16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through
additional training data sources or innovations in machine learning. Higher
magnitude errors occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be
accurately predicted regardless of innovation. There is a diversity of error
behavior depending on the energy meter type (electricity prediction models have

                                        <span>Many modern time-series datasets contain large numbers of output response
variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience,
the activities of 100s-1000&#x27;s of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in
response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the
nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple
outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations
between the output response variables are invariant in the input space.
Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend
on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output
dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for
large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series
problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal
stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint
amongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational
burden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output
dependence. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedures for both
SLMM and OSLMM and demonstrate superior model scalability and reduced
prediction error of OSLMM compared with state-of-the-art methods on several
real-world applications. In neurophysiology recordings, we use the inferred
latent functions for compact visualization of population responses to auditory
stimuli, and demonstrate superior results compared to a competing method
(GPFA). Together, these results demonstrate that OSLMM will be useful for the
analysis of diverse, large-scale time-series datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Multifidelity simulation methodologies are often used in an attempt to
judiciously combine low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation results in an
accuracy-increasing, cost-saving way. Candidates for this approach are
simulation methodologies for which there are fidelity differences connected
with significant computational cost differences. Physics-informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) are candidates for these types of approaches due to the
significant difference in training times required when different fidelities
(expressed in terms of architecture width and depth as well as optimization
criteria) are employed. In this paper, we propose a particular multifidelity
approach applied to PINNs that exploits low-rank structure. We demonstrate that
width, depth, and optimization criteria can be used as parameters related to
model fidelity, and show numerical justification of cost differences in
training due to fidelity parameter choices. We test our multifidelity scheme on
various canonical forward PDE models that have been presented in the emerging
PINNs literature.</span>

depending on multiple local clients, while keeping the training data
decentralized in order to preserve data privacy. However, standard FL methods
ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the
aggregated model. In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement,
and then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g.,
Bernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients,
we propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client
Learning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main
components: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data
quality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to
adaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the
amount of local training data and the data quality of each client. Our Fed-NCL
can be easily applied in any standard FL workflow to handle the noisy client
issue. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm
boosts the performances of different state-of-the-art systems with noisy

                                        <span>Physics perception very often faces the problem that only limited data or
partial measurements on the scene are available. In this work, we propose a
strategy to learn the full state of sloshing liquids from measurements of the
free surface. Our approach is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
project the limited information available to a reduced-order manifold so as to
not only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of
performing fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain
physically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the
reduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the
fulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the
required hidden information to correlate the limited information with the
latent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back
to the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful
information in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a
computer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with
real information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting
future states of the observed fluid in real-time.</span>

byte-level n-gram embeddings. byteSteady assumes that each input comes as a
sequence of bytes. A representation vector is produced using the averaged
embedding vectors of byte-level n-grams, with a pre-defined set of n. The
hashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors. This input
representation vector is then fed into a linear classifier. A straightforward
application of byteSteady is text classification. We also apply byteSteady to
one type of non-language data -- DNA sequences for gene classification. For
both problems we achieved competitive classification results against strong
baselines, suggesting that byteSteady can be applied to both language and
non-language data. Furthermore, we find that simple compression using Huffman
coding does not significantly impact the results, which offers an
accuracy-speed trade-off previously unexplored in machine learning.</span>

called Post Selection Using Test Sets (PSUTS). Consequently, the popular
error-backprop methodology in deep learning lacks an acceptable generalization
power. All AI methods fall into two broad schools, connectionist and symbolic.
The PSUTS fall into two kinds, machine PSUTS and human PSUTS. The connectionist
school received criticisms for its &quot;scruffiness&quot; due to a huge number of
network parameters and now the worse machine PSUTS; but the seemingly &quot;clean&quot;
symbolic school seems more brittle because of a weaker generalization power
using human PSUTS. This paper formally defines what PSUTS is, analyzes why
error-backprop methods with random initial weights suffer from severe local
minima, why PSUTS violates well-established research ethics, and how every
paper that used PSUTS should have at least transparently reported PSUTS. For
improved transparency in future publications, this paper proposes a new
standard for performance evaluation of AI, called developmental errors for all
networks trained, along with Three Learning Conditions: (1) an incremental
learning architecture, (2) a training experience and (3) a limited amount of
computational resources. Developmental Networks avoid PSUTS and are not
&quot;scruffy&quot; because they drive Emergent Turing Machines and are optimal in the
sense of maximum-likelihood across lifetime.</span>

$d$-dimensional (sub)Gaussian distributions with unknown covariance.
Informally, given $n \gtrsim d/\alpha^2$ samples from such a distribution with
mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, our estimators output $\tilde\mu$ such that
$\| \tilde\mu - \mu \|_{\Sigma} \leq \alpha$, where $\| \cdot \|_{\Sigma}$ is
the Mahalanobis distance. All previous estimators with the same guarantee
either require strong a priori bounds on the covariance matrix or require
$\Omega(d^{3/2})$ samples.

Each of our estimators is based on a simple, general approach to designing
differentially private mechanisms, but with novel technical steps to make the
estimator private and sample-efficient. Our first estimator samples a point
with approximately maximum Tukey depth using the exponential mechanism, but
restricted to the set of points of large Tukey depth. Proving that this
mechanism is private requires a novel analysis. Our second estimator perturbs
the empirical mean of the data set with noise calibrated to the empirical
covariance, without releasing the covariance itself. Its sample complexity
guarantees hold more generally for subgaussian distributions, albeit with a
slightly worse dependence on the privacy parameter. For both estimators,
careful preprocessing of the data is required to satisfy differential privacy.</span>

                                        <span>Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system for the deaf or hearing
impaired people. It combines lip movements with hand cues to obtain a complete
phonetic repertoire. Current deep learning based methods on automatic CS
recognition suffer from a common problem, which is the data scarcity. Until
now, there are only two public single speaker datasets for French (238
sentences) and British English (97 sentences). In this work, we propose a
cross-modal knowledge distillation method with teacher-student structure, which
transfers audio speech information to CS to overcome the limited data problem.
Firstly, we pretrain a teacher model for CS recognition with a large amount of
open source audio speech data, and simultaneously pretrain the feature
extractors for lips and hands using CS data. Then, we distill the knowledge
from teacher model to the student model with frame-level and sequence-level
distillation strategies. Importantly, for frame-level, we exploit multi-task
learning to weigh losses automatically, to obtain the balance coefficient.
Besides, we establish a five-speaker British English CS dataset for the first

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally
efficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current
methods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing
spatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high
performance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches
representing/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal
structure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational
cost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we
call Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing
fine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval
performance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network
that at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to
maintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We
train several students with different architectures and arrive at different
trade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,
including fine-grained students that store index videos using binary
representations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation
in large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS
on five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and
demonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in
several cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off
between retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In
specific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but
is 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space. Our collected
dataset and implementation are publicly available:

                                        <span>Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for
efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable
self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively
answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered
evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to
evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority
of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling
methods.</span>

                                        <span>Much of the delivery of University education is now by synchronous or
asynchronous video. For students, one of the challenges is managing the sheer
volume of such video material as video presentations of taught material are
difficult to abbreviate and summarise because they do not have highlights which
stand out. Apart from video bookmarks there are no tools available to determine
which parts of video content should be replayed at revision time or just before
examinations. We have developed and deployed a digital library for managing
video learning material which has many dozens of hours of short-form video
content from a range of taught courses for hundreds of students at
undergraduate level. Through a web browser we allow students to access and play
these videos and we log their anonymised playback usage. From these logs we
score to each segment of each video based on the amount of playback it receives
from across all students, whether the segment has been re-wound and re-played
in the same student session, whether the on-screen window is the window in
focus on the student&#x27;s desktop/laptop, and speed of playback. We also
incorporate negative scoring if a video segment is skipped or fast-forward, and
overarching all this we include a decay function based on recency of playback,
so the most recent days of playback contribute more to the video segment
scores. For each video in the library we present a usage-based graph which
allows students to see which parts of each video attract the most playback from
their peers, which helps them select material at revision time. Usage of the
system is fully anonymised and GDPR-compliant.</span>

                                        <span>The paper presents a new approach to multiview video coding using Screen
Content Coding. It is assumed that for a time instant the frames corresponding
to all views are packed into a single frame, i.e. the frame-compatible approach
to multiview coding is applied. For such coding scenario, the paper
demonstrates that Screen Content Coding can be efficiently used for multiview
video coding. Two approaches are considered: the first using standard HEVC
Screen Content Coding, and the second using Advanced Screen Content Coding. The
latter is the original proposal of the authors that exploits quarter-pel motion
vectors and other nonstandard extensions of HEVC Screen Content Coding. The
experimental results demonstrate that multiview video coding even using
standard HEVC Screen Content Coding is much more efficient than simulcast HEVC
coding. The proposed Advanced Screen Content Coding provides virtually the same
coding efficiency as MV-HEVC, which is the state-of-the-art multiview video
compression technique. The authors suggest that Advanced Screen Content Coding
can be efficiently used within the new Versatile Video Coding (VVC) technology.
Nevertheless a reference multiview extension of VVC does not exist yet,
therefore, for VVC-based coding, the experimental comparisons are left for
future work.</span>
