                                        <span>Lexicon information and pre-trained models, such as BERT, have been combined
to explore Chinese sequence labelling tasks due to their respective strengths.
However, existing methods solely fuse lexicon features via a shallow and random
initialized sequence layer and do not integrate them into the bottom layers of
BERT. In this paper, we propose Lexicon Enhanced BERT (LEBERT) for Chinese
sequence labelling, which integrates external lexicon knowledge into BERT
layers directly by a Lexicon Adapter layer. Compared with the existing methods,
our model facilitates deep lexicon knowledge fusion at the lower layers of
BERT. Experiments on ten Chinese datasets of three tasks including Named Entity
Recognition, Word Segmentation, and Part-of-Speech tagging, show that LEBERT
achieves the state-of-the-art results.</span>

companies and government organizations. Several studies have been recently
published investigating methods to detect the various forms of such content
(e.g. hate speech, cyberbullying, and cyberaggression). The clear majority of
these studies deal with English partially because most annotated datasets
available contain English data. In this paper, we take advantage of available
English datasets by applying cross-lingual contextual word embeddings and
transfer learning to make predictions in low-resource languages. We project
predictions on comparable data in Arabic, Bengali, Danish, Greek, Hindi,
Spanish, and Turkish. We report results of 0.8415 F1 macro for Bengali in
TRAC-2 shared task, 0.8532 F1 macro for Danish and 0.8701 F1 macro for Greek in
OffensEval 2020, 0.8568 F1 macro for Hindi in HASOC 2019 shared task and 0.7513
F1 macro for Spanish in in SemEval-2019 Task 5 (HatEval) showing that our
approach compares favourably to the best systems submitted to recent shared
tasks on these three languages. Additionally, we report competitive performance
on Arabic, and Turkish using the training and development sets of OffensEval
2020 shared task. The results for all languages confirm the robustness of
cross-lingual contextual embeddings and transfer learning for this task.</span>

                                        <span>When language models process syntactically complex sentences, do they use
abstract syntactic information present in these sentences in a manner that is
consistent with the grammar of English, or do they rely solely on a set of
heuristics? We propose a method to tackle this question, AlterRep. For any
linguistic feature in the sentence, AlterRep allows us to generate
counterfactual representations by altering how this feature is encoded, while
leaving all other aspects of the original representation intact. Then, by
measuring the change in a models&#x27; word prediction with these counterfactual
representations in different sentences, we can draw causal conclusions about
the contexts in which the model uses the linguistic feature (if any). Applying
this method to study how BERT uses relative clause (RC) span information, we
found that BERT uses information about RC spans during agreement prediction
using the linguistically correct strategy. We also found that counterfactual
representations generated for a specific RC subtype influenced the number
prediction in sentences with other RC subtypes, suggesting that information
about RC boundaries was encoded abstractly in BERT&#x27;s representation.</span>

through neural encoding mechanisms. We demonstrate that N-XKT is able to

Specifically, by leveraging facts from background explanatory knowledge

Furthermore, we show that N-XKT can be fine-tuned on a target QA dataset,
enabling faster convergence and more accurate results. A systematic analysis is
conducted to quantitatively analyze the performance of the N-XKT model and the

                                        <span>Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences
from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error
rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a
sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine
translation by a large margin.</span>

knowledge in both known and unknown domains. For example, one may be an expert
in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but want to determine the best
order to learn new concepts in an unfamiliar Computer Vision domain (CV). Both
domains share some common concepts, such as machine learning basics and deep
learning models. In this paper, we propose unsupervised cross-domain concept
prerequisite chain learning using an optimized variational graph autoencoder.
Our model learns to transfer concept prerequisite relations from an
information-rich domain (source domain) to an information-poor domain (target
domain), substantially surpassing other baseline models. Also, we expand an
existing dataset by introducing two new domains: CV and Bioinformatics (BIO).

knowledge regarding facts or common sense. However, because no model is
perfect, they still fail to provide appropriate answers in many cases. In this
paper, we ask the question &quot;how can we know when language models know, with
confidence, the answer to a particular query?&quot; We examine this question from
the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic model&#x27;s
predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probabilities
of correctness. We examine three strong generative models -- T5, BART, and
GPT-2 -- and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated,
finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to
calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the
likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability
modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on
a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We
also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods,
shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for
calibrating LMs. We have released the code at

multi-modal tasks, and cannot effectively adapt to each other. They can only
utilize single-modal data (i.e. text or image) or limited multi-modal data
(i.e. image-text pairs). In this work, we propose a unified-modal pre-training
architecture, namely UNIMO, which can effectively adapt to both single-modal
and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. Large scale of free text
corpus and image collections can be utilized to improve the capability of
visual and textual understanding, and cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL)
is leveraged to align the textual and visual information into a unified
semantic space over a corpus of image-text pairs. As the non-paired
single-modal data is very rich, our model can utilize much larger scale of data
to learn more generalizable representations. Moreover, the textual knowledge
and visual knowledge can enhance each other in the unified semantic space. The
experimental results show that UNIMO significantly improves the performance of
several single-modal and multi-modal downstream tasks. Our code and pre-trained
models are public at

distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However,
it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing
cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of
its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like
racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a
machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the
first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online
antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting
signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling
multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any
publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect
and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and
Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that
detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism
category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of
experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.</span>

                                        <span>Human language has been described as a system that makes \textit{use of
finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts}. Of particular interest
is the aspect of compositionality, whereby, the meaning of a compound language
expression can be deduced from the meaning of its constituent parts. If
artificial agents can develop compositional communication protocols akin to
human language, they can be made to seamlessly generalize to unseen
combinations. However, the real question is, how do we induce compositionality
in emergent communication? Studies have recognized the role of curiosity in
enabling linguistic development in children. It is this same intrinsic urge
that drives us to master complex tasks with decreasing amounts of explicit
reward. In this paper, we seek to use this intrinsic feedback in inducing a
systematic and unambiguous protolanguage in artificial agents. We show how
these rewards can be leveraged in training agents to induce compositionality in
absence of any external feedback. Additionally, we introduce gComm, an
environment for investigating grounded language acquisition in 2D-grid
environments. Using this, we demonstrate how compositionality can enable agents
to not only interact with unseen objects but also transfer skills from one task
to another in a zero-shot setting: \textit{Can an agent, trained to &#x60;pull&#x27; and
&#x60;push twice&#x27;, &#x60;pull twice&#x27;?}.</span>

(NLP) in recent years, proving effective even in tasks done in low-resource
languages. While pretrained transformers for these languages can be made, it is
challenging to measure their true performance and capacity due to the lack of
hard benchmark datasets, as well as the difficulty and cost of producing them.
In this paper, we present three contributions: First, we propose a methodology
for automatically producing Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark datasets
for low-resource languages using published news articles. Through this, we
create and release NewsPH-NLI, the first sentence entailment benchmark dataset
in the low-resource Filipino language. Second, we produce new pretrained
transformers based on the ELECTRA technique to further alleviate the resource
scarcity in Filipino, benchmarking them on our dataset against other
commonly-used transfer learning techniques. Lastly, we perform analyses on
transfer learning techniques to shed light on their true performance when
operating in low-data domains through the use of degradation tests.</span>

society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted
settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary
natural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this
specification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,
we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our
benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line
solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large
language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the
prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as
GPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,
so we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As
the social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming
years, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking
advancements.</span>

beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large
transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once
trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,
it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.
This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.
Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query
projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables
heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of
parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query
dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and
vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained
multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.
Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query
projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.</span>

In this work, we introduced UmlsBERT, a contextual embedding model that

performed in two ways: i) connecting words that have the same underlying

recognition becomes a key component to deliver relevant search results. Errors
introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) lead to irrelevant search
results returned to the user, thus causing user dissatisfaction. In this paper,
we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space
without depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to
system constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run
on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several
proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making
internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis
showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries
is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR
systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant
improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in
one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as
complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not
be frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts.</span>

                                        <span>Question generation (QG) is a natural language generation task where a model
is trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent
approaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional
features and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase
model complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.
A single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer
learning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of
additional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,
outperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95
METEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to
their context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also
introduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not
previously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model
capacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended
in order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs
as question generators.</span>

conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core

for discrete waveform modeling (MWDLP). MWDLP employs a coarse-fine bit WaveRNN
architecture for 10-bit mu-law waveform modeling. A sparse gated recurrent unit
with a relatively large size of hidden units is utilized, while the multiband
modeling is deployed to achieve real-time low-latency usage. A novel technique

proposed, where the LP coefficients are estimated in a data-driven manner.
Moreover, a novel loss function using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for

                                        <span>An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural
document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -
e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based
document ranking models.</span>

                                        <span>Constituent and dependency parsing, the two classic forms of syntactic
parsing, have been found to benefit from joint training and decoding under a
uniform formalism, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). However,
decoding this unified grammar has a higher time complexity ($O(n^5)$) than
decoding either form individually ($O(n^3)$) since more factors have to be
considered during decoding. We thus propose an improved head scorer that helps
achieve a novel performance-preserved parser in $O$($n^3$) time complexity.
Furthermore, on the basis of this proposed practical HPSG parser, we
investigated the strengths of HPSG-based parsing and explored the general
method of training an HPSG-based parser from only a constituent or dependency
annotations in a multilingual scenario. We thus present a more effective, more
in-depth, and general work on HPSG parsing.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce Korean Language Understanding Evaluation (KLUE) benchmark. KLUE
is a collection of 8 Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks,
including Topic Classification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural Language
Inference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing,
Machine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We build all of the
tasks from scratch from diverse source corpora while respecting copyrights, to
ensure accessibility for anyone without any restrictions. With ethical
considerations in mind, we carefully design annotation protocols. Along with
the benchmark tasks and data, we provide suitable evaluation metrics and
fine-tuning recipes for pretrained language models for each task. We
furthermore release the pretrained language models (PLM), KLUE-BERT and
KLUE-RoBERTa, to help reproduce baseline models on KLUE and thereby facilitate
future research. We make a few interesting observations from the preliminary
experiments using the proposed KLUE benchmark suite, already demonstrating the
usefulness of this new benchmark suite. First, we find KLUE-RoBERTa-large
outperforms other baselines, including multilingual PLMs and existing
open-source Korean PLMs. Second, we see minimal degradation in performance even
when we replace personally identifiable information from the pretraining
corpus, suggesting that privacy and NLU capability are not at odds with each
other. Lastly, we find that using BPE tokenization in combination with
morpheme-level pre-tokenization is effective in tasks involving morpheme-level
tagging, detection and generation. In addition to accelerating Korean NLP
research, our comprehensive documentation on creating KLUE will facilitate
creating similar resources for other languages in the future. KLUE is available
at this https URL (https://klue-benchmark.com/).</span>

                                        <span>Distantly supervised (DS) relation extraction (RE) has attracted much
attention in the past few years as it can utilize large-scale auto-labeled
data. However, its evaluation has long been a problem: previous works either
took costly and inconsistent methods to manually examine a small sample of
model predictions, or directly test models on auto-labeled data -- which, by
our check, produce as much as 53% wrong labels at the entity pair level in the
popular NYT10 dataset. This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,
but also made it hard to understand where we are and what&#x27;s left to improve in
the research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we
build manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,
and thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest
pre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can
indicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some
unexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating
performance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to
previous methods. We hope that both our manual test sets and novel observations
can help advance future DS-RE research.</span>

                                        <span>Extensive research on target-dependent sentiment classification (TSC) has led
to strong classification performances in domains where authors tend to
explicitly express sentiment about specific entities or topics, such as in
reviews or on social media. We investigate TSC in news articles, a much less
researched domain, despite the importance of news as an essential information
source in individual and societal decision making. This article introduces
NewsTSC, a manually annotated dataset to explore TSC on news articles.
Investigating characteristics of sentiment in news and contrasting them to
popular TSC domains, we find that sentiment in the news is expressed less
explicitly, is more dependent on context and readership, and requires a greater
degree of interpretation. In an extensive evaluation, we find that the state of
the art in TSC performs worse on news articles than on other domains (average
recall AvgRec &#x3D; 69.8 on NewsTSC compared to AvgRev &#x3D; [75.6, 82.2] on
established TSC datasets). Reasons include incorrectly resolved relation of
target and sentiment-bearing phrases and off-context dependence. As a major
improvement over previous news TSC, we find that BERT&#x27;s natural language
understanding capabilities capture the less explicit sentiment used in news
articles.</span>

demonstrate that self-reflection can trigger a change in communication
behaviors, which lead to increased customer satisfaction. We illustrate and
test our approach analyzing e-mails of a large global services company by
comparing changes in customer satisfaction associated with team leaders exposed
to virtual mirroring (the experimental group). We find an increase in customer
satisfaction in the experimental group and a decrease in the control group

the individual communication indicators, we find that customer satisfaction is
higher when employees are more responsive, use a simpler language, are embedded
in less centralized communication networks, and show more stable leadership
patterns.</span>

                                        <span>Distributional semantics has deeply changed in the last decades. First,
predict models stole the thunder from traditional count ones, and more recently
both of them were replaced in many NLP applications by contextualized vectors
produced by Transformer neural language models. Although an extensive body of
research has been devoted to Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) evaluation, we
still lack a thorough comparison with respect to tested models, semantic tasks,
and benchmark datasets. Moreover, previous work has mostly focused on
task-driven evaluation, instead of exploring the differences between the way
models represent the lexical semantic space. In this paper, we perform a
comprehensive evaluation of type distributional vectors, either produced by
static DSMs or obtained by averaging the contextualized vectors generated by
BERT. First of all, we investigate the performance of embeddings in several
semantic tasks, carrying out an in-depth statistical analysis to identify the
major factors influencing the behavior of DSMs. The results show that i.) the
alleged superiority of predict based models is more apparent than real, and
surely not ubiquitous and ii.) static DSMs surpass contextualized
representations in most out-of-context semantic tasks and datasets.
Furthermore, we borrow from cognitive neuroscience the methodology of
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to inspect the semantic spaces

                                        <span>Today, we are seeing an ever-increasing number of clinical notes that contain
clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of patient&#x27;s health state.
All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can
help people and domain experts with their common healthcare tasks. However,
many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Empathetic response from the therapist is key to the success of clinical
psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing. Previous work on
computational modelling of empathy in motivational interviewing has focused on
offline, session-level assessment of therapist empathy, where empathy captures
all efforts that the therapist makes to understand the client&#x27;s perspective and
convey that understanding to the client. In this position paper, we propose a
novel task of turn-level detection of client need for empathy. Concretely, we
propose to leverage pre-trained language models and empathy-related general
conversation corpora in a unique labeller-detector framework, where the
labeller automatically annotates a motivational interviewing conversation
corpus with empathy labels to train the detector that determines the need for
therapist empathy. We also lay out our strategies of extending the detector
with additional-input and multi-task setups to improve its detection and
explainability.</span>

particularly in cross-sentence settings. The key to dealing with the problem is
to encode semantic information and model event inter-dependency at a
document-level. In this paper, we reformulate it as a Seq2Seq task and propose
a Multi-Layer Bidirectional Network (MLBiNet) to capture the document-level
association of events and semantic information simultaneously. Specifically, a
bidirectional decoder is firstly devised to model event inter-dependency within
a sentence when decoding the event tag vector sequence. Secondly, an
information aggregation module is employed to aggregate sentence-level semantic
and event tag information. Finally, we stack multiple bidirectional decoders
and feed cross-sentence information, forming a multi-layer bidirectional
tagging architecture to iteratively propagate information across sentences. We
show that our approach provides significant improvement in performance compared

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an
emphasis on the quality of non-English language directions. Our intuition is
based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose \method, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mCOLT is empowered by two techniques: (i) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and (ii) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mCOLT achieves
competitive or even better performance than a strong pre-trained model mBART on
tens of WMT benchmarks. For non-English directions, mCOLT achieves an
improvement of average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual baseline.</span>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Health Outcomes Challenge seeking solutions to
predict risk in value-based care for incorporation into CMS Innovation Center
payment and service delivery models. Recently, modern language models have
played key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to
the best of our knowledge, the first application of these models to patient
readmission prediction. To facilitate this, we create a dataset of 1.2 million
medical history samples derived from the Limited Dataset (LDS) issued by CMS.
Moreover, we propose a comprehensive modeling solution centered on a deep
learning framework for this data. To demonstrate the framework, we train an
attention-based Transformer to learn Medicare semantics in support of
performing downstream prediction tasks thereby achieving 0.91 AUC and 0.91
recall on readmission classification. We also introduce a novel data

therefore, widely demanded by numerous Natural Language Processing
applications. In particular, left-to-right and top-down transition-based
algorithms that rely on Pointer Networks are among the most accurate approaches
for performing dependency parsing. Additionally, it has been observed for the
top-down algorithm that Pointer Networks&#x27; sequential decoding can be improved
by implementing a hierarchical variant, more adequate to model dependency
structures. Considering all this, we develop a bottom-up-oriented Hierarchical
Pointer Network for the left-to-right parser and propose two novel
transition-based alternatives: an approach that parses a sentence in
right-to-left order and a variant that does it from the outside in. We
empirically test the proposed neural architecture with the different algorithms
on a wide variety of languages, outperforming the original approach in
practically all of them and setting new state-of-the-art results on the English

started drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from
different source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,
existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as
the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long
ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to
generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce
AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with
videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic
conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding
research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and
uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\name}, a factorized
multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently
captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input
modalities for the text summarization task. {\name} utilizes an increasing
number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly
better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments
illustrate that {\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for
short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse
duration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$
ROUGE-L points respectively.</span>

aims at generating answers to questions phrased in natural language. While
there has been substantial progress in open-domain question answering, QA
systems are still struggling to answer questions which involve geographic
entities or concepts and that require spatial operations. In this paper, we
discuss the problem of geographic question answering (GeoQA). We first
investigate the reasons why geographic questions are difficult to answer by
analyzing challenges of geographic questions. We discuss the uniqueness of
geographic questions compared to general QA. Then we review existing work on
GeoQA and classify them by the types of questions they can address. Based on
this survey, we provide a generic classification framework for geographic
questions. Finally, we conclude our work by pointing out unique future research
directions for GeoQA.</span>

classifying them into specific event types. In real-world applications, ED
typically does not have sufficient labelled data, thus can be formulated as a
few-shot learning problem. To tackle the issue of low sample diversity in
few-shot ED, we propose a novel knowledge-based few-shot event detection method
which uses a definition-based encoder to introduce external event knowledge as
the knowledge prior of event types. Furthermore, as external knowledge
typically provides limited and imperfect coverage of event types, we introduce
an adaptive knowledge-enhanced Bayesian meta-learning method to dynamically
adjust the knowledge prior of event types. Experiments show our method
consistently and substantially outperforms a number of baselines by at least 15
absolute F1 points under the same few-shot settings.</span>

                                        <span>Recent studies constructing direct interactions between the claim and each
single user response (a comment or a relevant article) to capture evidence have
shown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. Owing to
different single responses convey different cognition of individual users
(i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of
individual cognition. However, individuals&#x27; cognition of social things is not
always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased
semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly
contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task
performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of
Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim
verification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture
the word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on
sentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and
adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view
of individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of
difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence
fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise
inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence
for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both. Experiments
on three benchmark datasets confirm that CICD achieves state-of-the-art
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Object detection can be regarded as a pixel clustering task, and its boundary
is determined by four extreme points (leftmost, top, rightmost, and bottom).
However, most studies focus on the center or corner points of the object, which
are actually conditional results of the extreme points. In this paper, we
present an Extreme-Point-Prediction-Based object detector (EPP-Net), which
directly regresses the relative displacement vector between each pixel and the
four extreme points. We also propose a new metric to measure the similarity
between two groups of extreme points, namely, Extreme Intersection over Union
(EIoU), and incorporate this EIoU as a new regression loss. Moreover, we
propose a novel branch to predict the EIoU between the ground-truth and the
prediction results, and combine it with the classification confidence as the
ranking keyword in non-maximum suppression. On the MS-COCO dataset, our method
achieves an average precision (AP) of 44.0% with ResNet-50 and an AP of 48.3%
with ResNeXt-101-DCN. The proposed EPP-Net provides a new method to detect
objects and outperforms state-of-the-art anchor-free detectors.</span>

better tools for adaptation. Floods, for example, are the most frequent natural
disaster, and better tools for flood risk communication could increase the
support for flood-resilient infrastructure development. Our work aims to enable
more visual communication of large-scale climate impacts via visualizing the
output of coastal flood models as satellite imagery. We propose the first deep
learning pipeline to ensure physical-consistency in synthetic visual satellite
imagery. We advanced a state-of-the-art GAN called pix2pixHD, such that it
produces imagery that is physically-consistent with the output of an
expert-validated storm surge model (NOAA SLOSH). By evaluating the imagery
relative to physics-based flood maps, we find that our proposed framework
outperforms baseline models in both physical-consistency and photorealism. We
envision our work to be the first step towards a global visualization of how
climate change shapes our landscape. Continuing on this path, we show that the
proposed pipeline generalizes to visualize arctic sea ice melt. We also publish
a dataset of over 25k labelled image-pairs to study image-to-image translation
in Earth observation.</span>

                                        <span>Bone mineral density (BMD) is a clinically critical indicator of
osteoporosis, usually measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Due
to the limited accessibility of DEXA machines and examinations, osteoporosis is
often under-diagnosed and under-treated, leading to increased fragility
fracture risks. Thus it is highly desirable to obtain BMDs with alternative
cost-effective and more accessible medical imaging examinations such as X-ray
plain films. In this work, we formulate the BMD estimation from plain hip X-ray
images as a regression problem. Specifically, we propose a new semi-supervised
self-training algorithm to train the BMD regression model using images coupled
with DEXA measured BMDs and unlabeled images with pseudo BMDs. Pseudo BMDs are
generated and refined iteratively for unlabeled images during self-training. We
also present a novel adaptive triplet loss to improve the model&#x27;s regression
accuracy. On an in-house dataset of 1,090 images (819 unique patients), our BMD
estimation method achieves a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8805 to
ground-truth BMDs. It offers good feasibility to use the more accessible and
cheaper X-ray imaging for opportunistic osteoporosis screening.</span>

                                        <span>Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has demonstrated great potential in
quantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the
intrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying
susceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue
susceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve
accuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch
between the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the
susceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning
architecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical
model, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the
relationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility
tensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The
convolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a
regularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by
ki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative
evaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed
deep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior
performance, demonstrating its potential for future applications.</span>

of past 3D skeletons. While this problem has recently received increasing
attention, it has mostly been tackled for single humans in isolation. In this
paper we explore this problem from a novel perspective, involving humans
performing collaborative tasks. We assume that the input of our system are two
sequences of past skeletons for two interacting persons, and we aim to predict
the future motion for each of them. For this purpose, we devise a novel cross
interaction attention mechanism that exploits historical information of both
persons and learns to predict cross dependencies between self poses and the
poses of the other person in spite of their spatial or temporal distance. Since
no dataset to train such interactive situations is available, we have captured
ExPI (Extreme Pose Interaction), a new lab-based person interaction dataset of
professional dancers performing acrobatics. ExPI contains 115 sequences with
30k frames and 60k instances with annotated 3D body poses and shapes. We
thoroughly evaluate our cross-interaction network on this dataset and show that
both in short-term and long-term predictions, it consistently outperforms
baselines that independently reason for each person. We plan to release our
code jointly with the dataset and the train/test splits to spur future research
on the topic.</span>

large scale dataset against a query image. Generally, the similarity between
the representative features of the query image and dataset images is used to
rank the images for retrieval. In early days, various hand designed feature
descriptors have been investigated based on the visual cues such as color,
texture, shape, etc. that represent the images. However, the deep learning has
emerged as a dominating alternative of hand-designed feature engineering from a
decade. It learns the features automatically from the data. This paper presents
a comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade
for content based image retrieval. The categorization of existing
state-of-the-art methods from different perspectives is also performed for
greater understanding of the progress. The taxonomy used in this survey covers
different supervision, different networks, different descriptor type and
different retrieval type. A performance analysis is also performed using the
state-of-the-art methods. The insights are also presented for the benefit of
the researchers to observe the progress and to make the best choices. The

obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest
X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal
shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,
and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To
accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available
chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage
existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection &quot;chest X-ray&quot;
images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an
automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays
comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest
X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On
a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model
achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a
dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50
projections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines
with limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity
quantification on chest X-rays.</span>

image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches
commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face
limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial
locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial
success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations,
this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and
normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name
Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially
a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through
attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN
into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced
stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform
for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces
visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.</span>

blood volume changes, may be especially useful for widespread contactless
health monitoring using face video from consumer-grade visible-light cameras.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the widespread use of protective face masks.
We found that occlusions from cloth face masks increased the mean absolute
error of heart rate estimation by more than 80\% when deploying methods
designed on unmasked faces. We show that augmenting unmasked face videos by
adding patterned synthetic face masks forces the model to attend to the
periocular and forehead regions, improving performance and closing the gap
between masked and unmasked pulse estimation. To our knowledge, this paper is
the first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of pulse
estimation and offers several novel contributions: (a) 3D CNN-based method
designed for remote photoplethysmography in a presence of face masks, (b) two
publicly available pulse estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61
masked subjects, (c) evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D CNN trained

present Emotional Video Portraits (EVP), a system for synthesizing high-quality

decompose speech into two decoupled spaces, i.e., a duration-independent
emotion space and a duration dependent content space. With the disentangled
features, dynamic 2D emotional facial landmarks can be deduced. Then we propose
the Target-Adaptive Face Synthesis technique to generate the final high-quality

                                        <span>Object recognition in unseen indoor environments remains a challenging
problem for visual perception of mobile robots. In this letter, we propose the
use of topologically persistent features, which rely on the objects&#x27; shape
information, to address this challenge. In particular, we extract two kinds of
features, namely, sparse persistence image (PI) and amplitude, by applying
persistent homology to multi-directional height function-based filtrations of
the cubical complexes representing the object segmentation maps. The features
are then used to train a fully connected network for recognition. For
performance evaluation, in addition to a widely used shape dataset and a
benchmark indoor scenes dataset, we collect a new dataset, comprising scene
images from two different environments, namely, a living room and a mock
warehouse. The scenes are captured using varying camera poses under different
illumination conditions and include up to five different objects from a given
set of fourteen objects. On the benchmark indoor scenes dataset, sparse PI
features show better recognition performance in unseen environments than the
features learned using the widely used ResNetV2-56 and EfficientNet-B4 models.
Further, they provide slightly higher recall and accuracy values than Faster
R-CNN, an end-to-end object detection method, and its state-of-the-art variant,
Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN. The performance of our methods also remains
relatively unchanged from the training environment (living room) to the unseen
environment (mock warehouse) in the new dataset. In contrast, the performance
of the object detection methods drops substantially. We also implement the
proposed method on a real-world robot to demonstrate its usefulness.</span>

                                        <span>Detecting COVID-19 in computed tomography (CT) or radiography images has been
proposed as a supplement to the definitive RT-PCR test. We present a deep
learning ensemble for detecting COVID-19 infection, combining slice-based (2D)
and volume-based (3D) approaches. The 2D system detects the infection on each
CT slice independently, combining them to obtain the patient-level decision via
different methods (averaging and long-short term memory networks). The 3D
system takes the whole CT volume to arrive to the patient-level decision in one
step. A new high resolution chest CT scan dataset, called the IST-C dataset, is
also collected in this work. The proposed ensemble, called IST-CovNet, obtains
90.80% accuracy and 0.95 AUC score overall on the IST-C dataset in detecting
COVID-19 among normal controls and other types of lung pathologies; and 93.69%
accuracy and 0.99 AUC score on the publicly available MosMed dataset that
consists of COVID-19 scans and normal controls only. The system is deployed at
Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine.</span>

or parts, and the impression of fonts. By focusing on local shapes instead of
the whole letter shape, we can realize letter-shape independent and more
general analysis. The analysis is performed by newly combining SIFT and
DeepSets, to extract an arbitrary number of essential parts from a particular
font and aggregate them to infer the font impressions by nonlinear regression.
Our qualitative and quantitative analyses prove that (1)fonts with similar
parts have similar impressions, (2)many impressions, such as legible and rough,
largely depend on specific parts, (3)several impressions are very irrelevant to

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs&#x27; performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>Improving irradiance forecasting is critical to further increase the share of
solar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground
are used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the
electricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the
Sun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a
reference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking
methods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires
access to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an
image-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is
visible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We
validate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA&#x27;s
lab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth
Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size.</span>

                                        <span>Policies trained in simulation often fail when transferred to the real world
due to the &#x60;reality gap&#x27; where the simulator is unable to accurately capture
the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to
tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and
engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to
learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too
conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system
parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world
without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to
reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively
shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system
parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of
observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the
given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate
the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in
both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement
over naive domain randomization. Project videos and code at

                                        <span>Detection faults in seismic data is a crucial step for seismic structural
interpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent
works regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation
requires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure
and lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a
huge workload. In this study, we present {\lambda}-BCE and {\lambda}-smooth
L1loss to effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that
the model can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices.
In order to fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic
noise, we propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision
training and embedded in the network. The attention heatmap target is generated
by the original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the
{\lambda}-smooth L1loss. The experiment proves the effectiveness of our loss
function and attention module, it also shows that our method can extract 3D
seismic features from a few 2D slices labels, and the segmentation effect
achieves state-of-the-art. We only use 3.3% of the all labels, and we can
achieve similar performance as using all labels. This work has been submitted

                                        <span>This paper pushes the envelope on camouflaged regions to decompose them into
meaningful components, namely, camouflaged instances. To promote the new task
of camouflaged instance segmentation in-the-wild, we introduce a new dataset,
namely CAMO++, by extending our preliminary CAMO dataset (camouflaged object
segmentation) in terms of quantity and diversity. The new dataset substantially
increases the number of images with hierarchical pixel-wise ground-truths. We
also provide a benchmark suite for the task of camouflaged instance
segmentation. In particular, we conduct extensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods on our newly constructed CAMO++
dataset in various scenarios. We also propose Camouflage Fusion Learning (CFL)
framework for camouflaged instance segmentation to further improve the
state-of-the-art performance. The dataset, model, evaluation suite, and
benchmark will be publicly available at our project page.

benefit of pre-training models on visual data such as ImageNet. While this
process allows knowledge transfer across different domains, training a model on
large-scale visual datasets is time consuming. On several audio event
classification benchmarks, we show a fast and effective alternative that
pre-trains the model unsupervised, only on audio data and yet delivers on-par
performance with ImageNet pre-training. Furthermore, we show that our
discriminative audio learning can be used to transfer knowledge across audio

                                        <span>Advances in the motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a
subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a
novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This
study indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop
MI-based BCI applications for new users without the need for calibration.</span>

                                        <span>Along with the rapid development of real-world applications, higher
requirements on the accuracy and efficiency of image super-resolution (SR) are
brought forward. Though existing methods have achieved remarkable success, the
majority of them demand plenty of computational resources and large amount of
RAM, and thus they can not be well applied to mobile device. In this paper, we
aim at designing efficient architecture for 8-bit quantization and deploy it on
mobile device. First, we conduct an experiment about meta-node latency by
decomposing lightweight SR architectures, which determines the portable
operations we can utilize. Then, we dig deeper into what kind of architecture
is beneficial to 8-bit quantization and propose anchor-based plain net (ABPN).
Finally, we adopt quantization-aware training strategy to further boost the
performance. Our model can outperform 8-bit quantized FSRCNN by nearly 2dB in
terms of PSNR, while satisfying realistic needs at the same time. Code is
avaliable at https://github.com/NJU- Jet/SR_Mobile_Quantization.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning has been used to demonstrate end-to-end neural network learning
for autonomous vehicle control from raw sensory input. While LiDAR sensors
provide reliably accurate information, existing end-to-end driving solutions
are mainly based on cameras since processing 3D data requires a large memory
footprint and computation cost. On the other hand, increasing the robustness of
these systems is also critical; however, even estimating the model&#x27;s
uncertainty is very challenging due to the cost of sampling-based methods. In
this paper, we present an efficient and robust LiDAR-based end-to-end
navigation framework. We first introduce Fast-LiDARNet that is based on sparse
convolution kernel optimization and hardware-aware model design. We then
propose Hybrid Evidential Fusion that directly estimates the uncertainty of the
prediction from only a single forward pass and then fuses the control
predictions intelligently. We evaluate our system on a full-scale vehicle and
demonstrate lane-stable as well as navigation capabilities. In the presence of
out-of-distribution events (e.g., sensor failures), our system significantly
improves robustness and reduces the number of takeovers in the real world.</span>

                                        <span>For over 40 years lithographic silicon scaling has driven circuit integration
and performance improvement in the semiconductor industry. As silicon scaling
slows down, the industry is increasingly dependent on IC package technologies
to contribute to further circuit integration and performance improvements. This
is a paradigm shift and requires the IC package industry to reduce the size and
increase the density of internal interconnects on a scale which has never been
done before. Traditional package characterization and process optimization
relies on destructive techniques such as physical cross-sections and delayering
to extract data from internal package features. These destructive techniques
are not practical with today&#x27;s advanced packages. In this paper we will
demonstrate how data acquired non-destructively with a 3D X-ray microscope can
be enhanced and optimized using machine learning, and can then be used to
measure, characterize and optimize the design and production of buried
interconnects in advanced IC packages. Test vehicles replicating 2.5D and HBM
construction were designed and fabricated, and digital data was extracted from
these test vehicles using 3D X-ray and machine learning techniques. The
extracted digital data was used to characterize and optimize the design and
production of the interconnects and demonstrates a superior alternative to
destructive physical analysis. We report an mAP of 0.96 for 3D object
detection, a dice score of 0.92 for 3D segmentation, and an average of 2.1um
error for 3D metrology on the test dataset. This paper is the first part of a
multi-part report.</span>

                                        <span>In order to be globally deployed, autonomous cars must guarantee the safety
of pedestrians. This is the reason why forecasting pedestrians&#x27; intentions
sufficiently in advance is one of the most critical and challenging tasks for
autonomous vehicles. This work tries to solve this problem by jointly
predicting the intention and visual states of pedestrians. In terms of visual
states, whereas previous work focused on x-y coordinates, we will also predict
the size and indeed the whole bounding box of the pedestrian. The method is a
recurrent neural network in a multi-task learning approach. It has one head
that predicts the intention of the pedestrian for each one of its future
position and another one predicting the visual states of the pedestrian.
Experiments on the JAAD dataset show the superiority of the performance of our
method compared to previous works for intention prediction. Also, although its
simple architecture (more than 2 times faster), the performance of the bounding
box prediction is comparable to the ones yielded by much more complex
architectures. Our code is available online.</span>

                                        <span>Humans are highly efficient learners, with the ability to grasp the meaning
of a new concept from just a few examples. Unlike popular computer vision
systems, humans can flexibly leverage the compositional structure of the visual
world, understanding new concepts as combinations of existing concepts. In the
current paper, we study how people learn different types of visual
compositions, using abstract visual forms with rich relational structure. We
find that people can make meaningful compositional generalizations from just a
few examples in a variety of scenarios, and we develop a Bayesian program
induction model that provides a close fit to the behavioral data. Unlike past
work examining special cases of compositionality, our work shows how a single
computational approach can account for many distinct types of compositional
generalization.</span>

                                        <span>The objective of this work is person-clustering in videos -- grouping
characters according to their identity. Previous methods focus on the narrower
task of face-clustering, and for the most part ignore other cues such as the
person&#x27;s voice, their overall appearance (hair, clothes, posture), and the
editing structure of the videos. Similarly, most current datasets evaluate only
the task of face-clustering, rather than person-clustering. This limits their
applicability to downstream applications such as story understanding which
require person-level, rather than only face-level, reasoning. In this paper we
make contributions to address both these deficiencies: first, we introduce a
Multi-Modal High-Precision Clustering algorithm for person-clustering in videos
using cues from several modalities (face, body, and voice). Second, we
introduce a Video Person-Clustering dataset, for evaluating multi-modal
person-clustering. It contains body-tracks for each annotated character,
face-tracks when visible, and voice-tracks when speaking, with their associated
features. The dataset is by far the largest of its kind, and covers films and
TV-shows representing a wide range of demographics. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of using multiple modalities for person-clustering, explore the
use of this new broad task for story understanding through character
co-occurrences, and achieve a new state of the art on all available datasets
for face and person-clustering.</span>

significantly improve the classification accuracy of a variety of lightweight

low-end embedded system platforms. Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a bio-inspired
RC model that mimics the cortical microcircuits and uses spiking neural
networks (SNN) that can be directly realized on neuromorphic hardware. In this
paper, we present a novel Parallelized LSM (PLSM) architecture that
incorporates spatio-temporal read-out layer and semantic constraints on model
output. To the best of our knowledge, such a formulation has been done for the
first time in literature, and it offers a computationally lighter alternative
to traditional deep-learning models. Additionally, we also present a
comprehensive algorithm for the implementation of parallelizable SNNs and LSMs
that are GPU-compatible. We implement the PLSM model to classify
unintentional/accidental video clips, using the Oops dataset. From the
experimental results on detecting unintentional action in video, it can be
observed that our proposed model outperforms a self-supervised model and a
fully supervised traditional deep learning model. All the implemented codes can
be found at our repository

as the overall image before making a decision. However, most existing deep
learning models only look at the entire X-ray image for classification, failing
to utilize important anatomical information. In this paper, we propose a novel
multi-label chest X-ray classification model that accurately classifies the
image finding and also localizes the findings to their correct anatomical
regions. Specifically, our model consists of two modules, the detection module
and the anatomical dependency module. The latter utilizes graph convolutional
networks, which enable our model to learn not only the label dependency but
also the relationship between the anatomical regions in the chest X-ray. We
further utilize a method to efficiently create an adjacency matrix for the
anatomical regions using the correlation of the label across the different
regions. Detailed experiments and analysis of our results show the
effectiveness of our method when compared to the current state-of-the-art
multi-label chest X-ray image classification methods while also providing
accurate location information.</span>

                                        <span>There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks
to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from human&#x27;s visual and intuitive perspective. We take
the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique
to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.
The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored
Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it
using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an
overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are
selected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the
effectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study
of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for
the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological
indices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception
augmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and
augmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology
study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.</span>

generators have become increasingly popular and accessible, causing dystopian
scenarios towards social erosion of trust. A particular domain, such as
biological signals, attracted attention towards detection methods that are
capable of exploiting authenticity signatures in real videos that are not yet
faked by generative approaches. In this paper, we first propose several
prominent eye and gaze features that deep fakes exhibit differently. Second, we
compile those features into signatures and analyze and compare those of real
and fake videos, formulating geometric, visual, metric, temporal, and spectral
variations. Third, we generalize this formulation to the deep fake detection
problem by a deep neural network, to classify any video in the wild as fake or
real. We evaluate our approach on several deep fake datasets, achieving 92.48%
accuracy on FaceForensics++, 80.0% on Deep Fakes (in the wild), 88.35% on
CelebDF, and 99.27% on DeeperForensics datasets. Our approach outperforms most

orientation of the moving object through analyzing the image sequences captured
by on-board cameras, has been well investigated with the rising interest in
autonomous driving. This paper studies monocular VO from the perspective of
Deep Learning (DL). Unlike most current learning-based methods, our approach,
called DeepAVO, is established on the intuition that features contribute
discriminately to different motion patterns. Specifically, we present a novel
four-branch network to learn the rotation and translation by leveraging
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus on different quadrants of optical
flow input. To enhance the ability of feature selection, we further introduce
an effective channel-spatial attention mechanism to force each branch to
explicitly distill related information for specific Frame to Frame (F2F) motion
estimation. Experiments on various datasets involving outdoor driving and
indoor walking scenarios show that the proposed DeepAVO outperforms the
state-of-the-art monocular methods by a large margin, demonstrating competitive
performance to the stereo VO algorithm and verifying promising potential for

                                        <span>Methods to quantify the complexity of trajectory datasets are still a missing
piece in benchmarking human trajectory prediction models. In order to gain a
better understanding of the complexity of trajectory prediction tasks and
following the intuition, that more complex datasets contain more information,
an approach for quantifying the amount of information contained in a dataset
from a prototype-based dataset representation is proposed. The dataset
representation is obtained by first employing a non-trivial spatial sequence
alignment, which enables a subsequent learning vector quantization (LVQ) stage.
A large-scale complexity analysis is conducted on several human trajectory
prediction benchmarking datasets, followed by a brief discussion on indications
for human trajectory prediction and benchmarking.</span>

                                        <span>Automated Parking is becoming a standard feature in modern vehicles. Existing
parking systems build a local map to be able to plan for maneuvering towards a
detected slot. Next generation parking systems have an use case where they
build a persistent map of the environment where the car is frequently parked,
say for example, home parking or office parking. The pre-built map helps in
re-localizing the vehicle better when its trying to park the next time. This is
achieved by augmenting the parking system with a Visual SLAM pipeline and the
feature is called trained trajectory parking in the automotive industry. In
this paper, we discuss the use cases, design and implementation of a trained
trajectory automated parking system. The proposed system is deployed on
commercial vehicles and the consumer application is illustrated in
\url{https://youtu.be/nRWF5KhyJZU}. The focus of this paper is on the
application and the details of vision algorithms are kept at high level.</span>

                                        <span>In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all
images in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size
which facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a
computational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance
due to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the
MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.</span>

                                        <span>The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is
strongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based
methods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved
cerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features
and are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background
clutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the
whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.

Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety
movement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from
short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative
information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy
screening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an
Australian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,
significantly outperforming existing competing methods with better
interpretability.</span>

                                        <span>In real-world scenarios, many factors may harm face recognition performance,
e.g., large pose, bad illumination,low resolution, blur and noise. To address
these challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces
to high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these
methods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In
this paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face
recognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to
restore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under
arbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a
well-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature
representation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and
restores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose
residual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module
(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its
real-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate
frontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a
strong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization
and face restoration.</span>

implications. For example, it plays a role in comfort, safety, posture, and
health. We present a method that infers contact pressure between a human body
and a mattress from a depth image. Specifically, we focus on using a depth
image from a downward facing camera to infer pressure on a body at rest in bed
occluded by bedding, which is directly applicable to the prevention of pressure
injuries in healthcare. Our approach involves augmenting a real dataset with
synthetic data generated via a soft-body physics simulation of a human body, a
mattress, a pressure sensing mat, and a blanket. We introduce a novel deep
network that we trained on an augmented dataset and evaluated with real data.
The network contains an embedded human body mesh model and uses a white-box
model of depth and pressure image generation. Our network successfully infers
body pose, outperforming prior work. It also infers contact pressure across a
3D mesh model of the human body, which is a novel capability, and does so in
the presence of occlusion from blankets.</span>

However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks
tobe able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited
computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning
techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning
pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et
al. (2018) has shown promising results when pruning at initialization. However,
for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned
networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one
layer from being fully pruned. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of Magnitude and Gradient based pruning at initialization
and training of sparse architectures. This allows us to propose novel
principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of NN
architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Learned networks in the domain of visual recognition and cognition impress in
part because even though they are trained with datasets many orders of
magnitude smaller than the full population of possible images, they exhibit
sufficient generalization to be applicable to new and previously unseen data.
Although many have examined issues regarding generalization from several
perspectives, we wondered If a network is trained with a biased dataset that
misses particular samples corresponding to some defining domain attribute, can
it generalize to the full domain from which that training dataset was
extracted? It is certainly true that in vision, no current training set fully
captures all visual information and this may lead to Selection Bias. Here, we
try a novel approach in the tradition of the Thought Experiment. We run this
thought experiment on a real domain of visual objects that we can fully
characterize and look at specific gaps in training data and their impact on
performance requirements. Our thought experiment points to three conclusions:
first, that generalization behavior is dependent on how sufficiently the
particular dimensions of the domain are represented during training; second,
that the utility of any generalization is completely dependent on the
acceptable system error; and third, that specific visual features of objects,
such as pose orientations out of the imaging plane or colours, may not be
recoverable if not represented sufficiently in a training set. Any currently
observed generalization in modern deep learning networks may be more the result
of coincidental alignments and whose utility needs to be confirmed with respect
to a system&#x27;s performance specification. Our Thought Experiment Probe approach,
coupled with the resulting Bias Breakdown can be very informative towards
understanding the impact of biases.</span>

                                        <span>Motivated by a challenging tubular network segmentation task, this paper
tackles two commonly encountered problems in biomedical imaging: Topological
consistency of the segmentation, and limited annotations. We propose a
topological score which measures both topological and geometric consistency
between the predicted and ground truth segmentations, applied for model
selection and validation. We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.
a U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised
U-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training
the network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm. This allows us
to utilize un-annotated data for training a representation that generalizes
across test data variability, in spite of our annotated training data having
very limited variation. Our contributions are validated on a challenging
segmentation task, locating tubular structures in the fetal pancreas from noisy
live imaging confocal microscopy.</span>

                                        <span>A major challenge for physically unconstrained gaze estimation is acquiring
training data with 3D gaze annotations for in-the-wild and outdoor scenarios.
In contrast, videos of human interactions in unconstrained environments are
abundantly available and can be much more easily annotated with frame-level
activity labels. In this work, we tackle the previously unexplored problem of
weakly-supervised gaze estimation from videos of human interactions. We
leverage the insight that strong gaze-related geometric constraints exist when
people perform the activity of &quot;looking at each other&quot; (LAEO). To acquire
viable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm
along with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With
weak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity
datasets, we show significant improvements in (a) the accuracy of
semi-supervised gaze estimation and (b) cross-domain generalization on the
state-of-the-art physically unconstrained in-the-wild Gaze360 gaze estimation
benchmark. We open source our code at

when fine-grained features or in our case rarely occurring anomalies are to be
detected. Current contributions point to the problem of how high-dimensional
data can be fused. In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data
description algorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using
three different fusion techniques i.e. early fusion, late fusion, and late
fusion with multiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with
a denoising process to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves
the performance (ROC AUC &#x3D; 80\%). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset
that consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple
perspectives, with 5\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g. drill
holes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset
using images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard
MNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
exceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on addressing
multi-perspective anomaly detection in images by jointly using different
perspectives together with one single objective function for anomaly detection.</span>

instances where depth sensors cannot be used, this distance has to be estimated
from RGB cameras. As opposed to cars, the task of estimating depth from
on-board mounted cameras is made complex on drones because of the lack of
constrains on motion during flights. %In the case of drones, this task is even
more complex than for car-mounted cameras since the camera motion is
unconstrained. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the distance of
objects seen by an on-board mounted camera by using its RGB video stream and
drone motion information. Our method is built upon a pyramidal convolutional
neural network architecture and uses time recurrence in pair with geometric
constraints imposed by motion to produce pixel-wise depth maps. %from a RGB
video stream of a camera attached to the drone In our architecture, each level
of the pyramid is designed to produce its own depth estimate based on past
observations and information provided by the previous level in the pyramid. We
introduce a spatial reprojection layer to maintain the spatio-temporal
consistency of the data between the levels. We analyse the performance of our
approach on Mid-Air, a public drone dataset featuring synthetic drone
trajectories recorded in a wide variety of unstructured outdoor environments.
Our experiments show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art depth
estimation methods and that the use of motion information is the main
contributing factor for this improvement. The code of our method is publicly
available on GitHub; see

                                        <span>Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts
are very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop
a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint
detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from
any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may
be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The
widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not
well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model
keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around
this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points
within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.
Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to
improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets
comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were
manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset
containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a
smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test
images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data
(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because
DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on
edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart
scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.</span>

Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and
algorithms, which otherwise take a huge amount of resources if built from
scratch. As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it&#x27;s very
important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have
only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of
vision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods
and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s optical
character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world
settings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and
Microsoft Azure&#x27;s Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the
conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and
transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These
methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such
attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for
high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully
evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision
(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).
90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the
vision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s
optical character recognition. Complementing to current research, our results
provide simple but unconventional methods on robustness evaluation.</span>

(AICITY21). The Track2 is a vehicle re-identification (ReID) task with both the
real-world data and synthetic data. We mainly focus on four points, i.e.
training data, unsupervised domain-adaptive (UDA) training, post-processing,
model ensembling in this challenge. (1) Both cropping training data and using
synthetic data can help the model learn more discriminative features. (2) Since
there is a new scenario in the test set that dose not appear in the training
set, UDA methods perform well in the challenge. (3) Post-processing techniques
including re-ranking, image-to-track retrieval, inter-camera fusion, etc,
significantly improve final performance. (4) We ensemble CNN-based models and
transformer-based models which provide different representation diversity. With
aforementioned techniques, our method finally achieves 0.7445 mAP score,
yielding the first place in the competition. Codes are available at

                                        <span>Deep convolutional networks have attracted great attention in image
restoration and enhancement. Generally, restoration quality has been improved
by building more and more convolutional block. However, these methods mostly
learn a specific model to handle all images and ignore difficulty diversity. In
other words, an area in the image with high frequency tend to lose more
information during compressing while an area with low frequency tends to lose
less. In this article, we adrress the efficiency issue in image SR by
incorporating a patch-wise rolling network(PRN) to content-adaptively recover
images according to difficulty levels. In contrast to existing studies that
ignore difficulty diversity, we adopt different stage of a neural network to
perform image restoration. In addition, we propose a rolling strategy that
utilizes the parameters of each stage more flexible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model not only shows a significant acceleration but also
maintain state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>Medical image segmentation is important for computer-aided diagnosis. Good
segmentation demands the model to see the big picture and fine details
simultaneously, i.e., to learn image features that incorporate large context
while keep high spatial resolutions. To approach this goal, the most widely
used methods -- U-Net and variants, extract and fuse multi-scale features.
However, the fused features still have small &quot;effective receptive fields&quot; with
a focus on local image cues, limiting their performance. In this work, we
propose Segtran, an alternative segmentation framework based on transformers,
which have unlimited &quot;effective receptive fields&quot; even at high feature
resolutions. The core of Segtran is a novel Squeeze-and-Expansion transformer:
a squeezed attention block regularizes the self attention of transformers, and
an expansion block learns diversified representations. Additionally, we propose
a new positional encoding scheme for transformers, imposing a continuity
inductive bias for images. Experiments were performed on 2D and 3D medical
image segmentation tasks: optic disc/cup segmentation in fundus images
(REFUGE&#x27;20 challenge), polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, and brain
tumor segmentation in MRI scans (BraTS&#x27;19 challenge). Compared with
representative existing methods, Segtran consistently achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy, and exhibited good cross-domain generalization
capabilities.</span>

                                        <span>The novel corona virus (Covid-19) has introduced significant challenges due
to its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,
there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease
diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective
radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a
sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep
leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that
utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt
models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training
dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the
transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging
domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this
circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network
(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR
images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits
important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using
graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is
not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of
extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three
class (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform
different benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned
drawbacks.</span>

                                        <span>Background and Objective: The new type of coronavirus is also called
COVID-19. It began to spread at the end of 2019 and has now spread across the
world. Until October 2020, It has infected around 37 million people and claimed
about 1 million lives. We propose a deep learning model that can help
radiologists and clinicians use chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19 cases and
show the diagnostic features of pneumonia. Methods: The approach in this study
is: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the
data set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our
deep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to
the DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly
improved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library
to mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more
quickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the
data with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training
respectively. At last, comparing two experimental results: among the 10 network
models with different structures, 7 network models have improved their effects
after using data enhancement, with an average improvement of 1% in recognition
accuracy. We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network
are 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs.
normal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by
2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective
results on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data
augmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the
sample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can
effectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.</span>

                                        <span>Learning based video compression attracts increasing attention in the past
few years. The previous hybrid coding approaches rely on pixel space operations
to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, which may suffer from inaccurate
motion estimation or less effective motion compensation. In this work, we
propose a feature-space video coding network (FVC) by performing all major
operations (i.e., motion estimation, motion compression, motion compensation
and residual compression) in the feature space. Specifically, in the proposed
deformable compensation module, we first apply motion estimation in the feature
space to produce motion information (i.e., the offset maps), which will be
compressed by using the auto-encoder style network. Then we perform motion
compensation by using deformable convolution and generate the predicted
feature. After that, we compress the residual feature between the feature from
the current frame and the predicted feature from our deformable compensation
module. For better frame reconstruction, the reference features from multiple
previous reconstructed frames are also fused by using the non-local attention
mechanism in the multi-frame feature fusion module. Comprehensive experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on four benchmark datasets including HEVC, UVG, VTL and MCL-JCV.</span>

the valuable information on tissue physiology that is contained in
multispectral photoacoustic measurements. Clinical translation of the
technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into
clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a
deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral

Manually annotated multispectral photoacoustic imaging data are used as gold

automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and
visualisations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive
representation of high-dimensional information, such a processing algorithm
could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of
photoacoustic imaging.</span>

line segmentation, unsupervised deep learning solutions are beginning to gain
popularity. In this paper, we present an unsupervised deep learning method that
embeds document image patches to a compact Euclidean space where distances
correspond to a coarse text line pattern similarity. Once this space has been
produced, text line segmentation can be easily implemented using standard
techniques with the embedded feature vectors. To train the model, we extract
random pairs of document image patches with the assumption that neighbour
patches contain a similar coarse trend of text lines, whereas if one of them is
rotated, they contain different coarse trends of text lines. Doing well on this
task requires the model to learn to recognize the text lines and their salient
parts. The benefit of our approach is zero manual labelling effort. We evaluate
the method qualitatively and quantitatively on several variants of text line
segmentation datasets to demonstrate its effectivity.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, collaborative learning proposed by Song and Chai has achieved
remarkable improvements in image classification tasks by simultaneously
training multiple classifier heads. However, huge memory footprints required by
such multi-head structures may hinder the training of large-capacity baseline
models. The natural question is how to achieve collaborative learning within a
single network without duplicating any modules. In this paper, we propose four
ways of collaborative learning among different parts of a single network with
negligible engineering efforts. To improve the robustness of the network, we
leverage the consistency of the output layer and intermediate layers for
training under the collaborative learning framework. Besides, the similarity of
intermediate representation and convolution kernel is also introduced to reduce
the reduce redundant in a neural network. Compared to the method of Song and
Chai, our framework further considers the collaboration inside a single model
and takes smaller overhead. Extensive experiments on Cifar-10, Cifar-100,
ImageNet32 and STL-10 corroborate the effectiveness of these four ways
separately while combining them leads to further improvements. In particular,
test errors on the STL-10 dataset are decreased by $9.28\%$ and $5.45\%$ for
ResNet-18 and VGG-16 respectively. Moreover, our method is proven to be robust
to label noise with experiments on Cifar-10 dataset. For example, our method
has $3.53\%$ higher performance under $50\%$ noise ratio setting.</span>

                                        <span>Recently few-shot object detection is widely adopted to deal with
data-limited situations. While most previous works merely focus on the
performance on few-shot categories, we claim that detecting all classes is
crucial as test samples may contain any instances in realistic applications,
which requires the few-shot detector to learn new concepts without forgetting.
Through analysis on transfer learning based methods, some neglected but
beneficial properties are utilized to design a simple yet effective few-shot
detector, Retentive R-CNN. It consists of Bias-Balanced RPN to debias the
pretrained RPN and Re-detector to find few-shot class objects without
forgetting previous knowledge. Extensive experiments on few-shot detection
benchmarks show that Retentive R-CNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on overall performance among all settings as it can achieve competitive
results on few-shot classes and does not degrade the base class performance at
all. Our approach has demonstrated that the long desired never-forgetting
learner is available in object detection.</span>

                                        <span>Object goal navigation aims to steer an agent towards a target object based
on observations of the agent. It is of pivotal importance to design effective
visual representations of the observed scene in determining navigation actions.
In this paper, we introduce a Visual Transformer Network (VTNet) for learning
informative visual representation in navigation. VTNet is a highly effective
structure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First,
the relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited;
Second, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so
that directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also
develop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with
navigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning. In a
nutshell, VTNet embeds object and region features with their location cues as
spatial-aware descriptors and then incorporates all the encoded descriptors
through attention operations to achieve informative representation for
navigation. Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the
correlations between visual observations and navigation actions. For example,
an agent would prioritize &quot;turning right&quot; over &quot;turning left&quot; when the visual
representation emphasizes on the right side of activation map. Experiments in
the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that VTNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments.</span>

the requirement of the labeled images, we propose ColorCount, a novel CNN-based
approach by combining self-supervised transfer colorization learning and global
prior classification to leverage the abundantly available unlabeled data. The
self-supervised colorization branch learns the semantics and surface texture of
the image by using its color components as pseudo labels. The classification
branch extracts global group priors by learning correlations among image
clusters. Their fused resultant discriminative features (global priors,
semantics and textures) provide ample priors for counting, hence significantly
reducing the requirement of labeled images. We conduct extensive experiments on
four challenging benchmarks. ColorCount achieves much better performance as
compared with other unsupervised approaches. Its performance is close to the
supervised baseline with substantially less labeled data (10\% of the original

concepts, namely substance concepts and classification concepts, the former
instrumental to (visual) perception, the latter to (language based)
classification. Based on this distinction, we introduce a general methodology
for building lexico-semantic hierarchies of substance concepts, where nodes are
annotated with the media, e.g.,videos or photos, from which substance concepts
are extracted, and are associated with the corresponding classification
concepts. The methodology is based on Ranganathan&#x27;s original faceted approach,
contextualized to the problem of classifying substance concepts. The key
novelty is that the hierarchy is built exploiting the visual properties of
substance concepts, while the linguistically defined properties of
classification concepts are only used to describe substance concepts. The
validity of the approach is exemplified by providing some highlights of an
ongoing project whose goal is to build a large scale multimedia multilingual

                                        <span>Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction.
Most existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the
relations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well
learned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human
motion&#x27;s balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part
to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions
are sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called
balance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to
characterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build
new joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and
thus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the
BA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,
mainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and
Multi-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global
Coordination Extractor (GCE) and Local Interaction Extractor (LIE). The former
presents the global coordination of all joints, and the latter encodes local
interactions between joint pairs. The MTDE is designed to extract dynamic
information from raw position information for effective prediction. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.</span>

discriminating them from the background is hard even for human beings. The main
objective of this paper is to explore the camouflaged object segmentation
problem, namely, segmenting the camouflaged object(s) for a given image. This
problem has not been well studied in spite of a wide range of potential
applications including the preservation of wild animals and the discovery of
new species, surveillance systems, search-and-rescue missions in the event of
natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes. This paper
addresses a new challenging problem of camouflaged object segmentation. To
address this problem, we provide a new image dataset of camouflaged objects for
benchmarking purposes. In addition, we propose a general end-to-end network,
called the Anabranch Network, that leverages both classification and
segmentation tasks. Different from existing networks for segmentation, our
proposed network possesses the second branch for classification to predict the
probability of containing camouflaged object(s) in an image, which is then
fused into the main branch for segmentation to boost up the segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on the newly built dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our network using various fully convolutional
networks. \url{https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/camo}</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research
interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation -- describing a shape as
a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point
clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used
in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential
and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for
existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and
natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.
We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and
random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset
consisting of 179,133 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made
this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.</span>

                                        <span>Registration networks have shown great application potentials in medical
image analysis. However, supervised training methods have a great demand for
large and high-quality labeled datasets, which is time-consuming and sometimes
impractical due to data sharing issues. Unsupervised image registration
algorithms commonly employ intensity-based similarity measures as loss
functions without any manual annotations. These methods estimate the
parameterized transformations between pairs of moving and fixed images through
the optimization of the network parameters during training. However, these
methods become less effective when the image quality varies, e.g., some images
are corrupted by substantial noise or artifacts. In this work, we propose a
novel approach based on a low-rank representation, i.e., Regnet-LRR, to tackle
the problem. We project noisy images into a noise-free low-rank space, and then
compute the similarity between the images. Based on the low-rank similarity
measure, we train the registration network to predict the dense deformation
fields of noisy image pairs. We highlight that the low-rank projection is
reformulated in a way that the registration network can successfully update
gradients. With two tasks, i.e., cardiac and abdominal intra-modality
registration, we demonstrate that the low-rank representation can boost the
generalization ability and robustness of models as well as bring significant
improvements in noisy data registration scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Attention mechanisms have been widely applied to cross-modal tasks such as
image captioning and information retrieval, and have achieved remarkable
improvements due to its capability to learn fine-grained relevance across
different modalities. However, existing attention models could be sub-optimal
and lack preciseness because there is no direct supervision involved during
training. In this work, we propose Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and
Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints to address such limitation.
These constraints supervise the training of attention models in a contrastive
learning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. Additionally,
we introduce three metrics, namely Attention Precision, Recall and F1-Score, to
quantitatively evaluate the attention quality. We evaluate the proposed
constraints with cross-modal retrieval (image-text matching) task. The
experiments on both Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that integrating
these attention constraints into two state-of-the-art attention-based models
improves the model performance in terms of both retrieval accuracy and
attention metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often
carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the
image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat
image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,
specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these
superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model
that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial
information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with
relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is
learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a &#x60;hybrid&#x27; loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:
COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint
Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel
information provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard
CNN-based vision systems.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, plenty of work has tried to introduce transformers into computer
vision tasks, with good results. Unlike classic convolution networks, which
extract features within a local receptive field, transformers can adaptively
aggregate similar features from a global view using self-attention mechanism.
For object detection, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) proposes feature
interaction across layers and proves its extremely importance. However, its
interaction is still in a local manner, which leaves a lot of room for
improvement. Since transformer was originally designed for NLP tasks, adapting
processing subject directly from text to image will cause unaffordable
computation and space overhead. In this paper, we utilize a linearized
attention function to overcome above problems and build a novel architecture,
named Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN), which proposes a
global content extraction module and deeply combines with FPN through light
linear transformers. What&#x27;s more, light transformers can further make the
application of multi-head attention mechanism easier. Most importantly, our
CA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive
experiments on the challenging COCO object detection dataset demonstrated that
our CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive baselines without bells and
whistles. Code will be made publicly available.</span>

familiar environment, can we recognize what the person is doing and identify
where the action occurs in the 3D space? We address this challenging problem of
jointly recognizing and localizing actions of a mobile user on a known 3D map
from egocentric videos. To this end, we propose a novel deep probabilistic
model. Our model takes the inputs of a Hierarchical Volumetric Representation
(HVR) of the environment and an egocentric video, infers the 3D action location
as a latent variable, and recognizes the action based on the video and
contextual cues surrounding its potential locations. To evaluate our model, we
conduct extensive experiments on a newly collected egocentric video dataset, in
which both human naturalistic actions and photo-realistic 3D environment
reconstructions are captured. Our method demonstrates strong results on both

However, this assumption is rarely met in real settings. Besides, there is no

                                        <span>With the advent of big data across multiple high-impact applications, we are
often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data
usually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,
thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although
state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with
sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to
obtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these
techniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich
unlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified
heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple
types of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the
proposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual
information of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the
hidden representation of two views of the same sample. Experimental results on
real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the
proposed method modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.</span>

species is not always possible due to the lack of 3D data. We present a method
to capture new species using an articulated template and images of that
species. In this work, we focus mainly on birds. Although birds represent
almost twice the number of species as mammals, no accurate shape model is
available. To capture a novel species, we first fit the articulated template to
each training sample. By disentangling pose and shape, we learn a shape space
that captures variation both among species and within each species from image
evidence. We learn models of multiple species from the CUB dataset, and
contribute new species-specific and multi-species shape models that are useful
for downstream reconstruction tasks. Using a low-dimensional embedding, we show
that our learned 3D shape space better reflects the phylogenetic relationships
among birds than learned perceptual features.</span>

                                        <span>Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF)
reconstruction applicable to diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth
phase variations.

Methods: Based on an unrolled proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network
architecture is derived which alternates between data consistency operations
and regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order to exploit
correlations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed
under consideration of permutation-equivariance. The proposed method is trained
on DW liver data of 60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and
prospectively sub-sampled data of different anatomies and resolutions. In
addition, the benefits of using a recurrent network over other unrolling
strategies is investigated.

Results: Conventional PF techniques can be significantly outperformed in
terms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual image quality. The
proposed method is able to generalize well to brain data with contrasts and
resolution not present in the training set. The reduction in echo time (TE)
associated with prospective PF-sampling enables DW imaging with higher signal.
Also, the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution can be compensated
for. It can be shown that unrolling by means of a recurrent network produced
better results than using a weight-shared network or a cascade of networks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data
is feasible even at strong PF factors in applications with severe phase
variations. Since the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the
phase but uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of
conventional PF methods can be avoided.</span>

The research on retinal vessel segmentation focuses mainly on improvement of
the segmentation model which is usually based on U-Net architecture. In our
study we use the U-Net architecture and we rely on heavy data augmentation in
order to achieve better performance. The success of the data augmentation
relies on successfully addressing the problem of input images. By analyzing

                                        <span>While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation
has recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,
existing approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were
gathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily
outfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the
demonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning
for vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this
work, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the
Imitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a
robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we
introduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for
Autonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies
from a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.
We evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA
not only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation
policies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a
wheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment
using a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.</span>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

among the most critical issues. Using a tier cache memory (along with branching
prediction) is an effective means of increasing modern multi-core processors&#x27;
performance. Designing high-performance processors is a complex task and
requires preliminary verification and analysis of the model level, usually used
in analytical and simulation modeling. The refinement of extreme programming is
an unfortunate challenge. Few experts disagree with the synthesis of access
points. This article demonstrates that Internet QoS and 16-bit architectures
are always incompatible, but it&#x27;s the same situation for write-back caches. The
solution to this problem can be implemented by analyzing simulation models of
different complexity in combination with the analytical evaluation of
individual algorithms. This work is devoted to designing a multi-parameter
simulation model of a multi-process for evaluating the performance of cache
memory algorithms and the optimality of the structure. Optimization of the
structures and algorithms of the cache memory allows you to accelerate the
interaction of the memory process and improve the performance of the entire

                                        <span>Interactive news recommendation has been launched and attracted much
attention recently. In this scenario, user&#x27;s behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user&#x27;s preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user&#x27;s demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user&#x27;s interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.</span>

                                        <span>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable the traditional recommender
systems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes
through interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely
adopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what
attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at
each conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one
or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated
conversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and
generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In
the light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three
decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to
systematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop
a dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action
at each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items.
Further, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action
selection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the
preference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS
datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method
not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances
the scalability and stability of CRS.</span>

conceptual schema is known to be a non-trivial problem. In particular the
formulation of ad-hoc queries is a major problem in such contexts. Existing
approaches for tackling this problem include graphical query interfaces, query
by navigation, query by construction, and point to point queries. In this
report we propose an adoption of the query by navigation mechanism that is
especially geared towards the InfoAssistant product. Query by navigation is
based on ideas from the information retrieval world, in particular on the
stratified hypermedia architecture. When using our approach to the formulations
of queries, a user will first formulate a number of simple queries
corresponding to linear paths through the information structure. The
formulation of the linear paths is the result of the {\em explorative phase} of
the query formulation. Once users have specified a number of these linear
paths, they may combine them to form more complex queries. Examples of such
combinations are: concatenation, union, intersection and selection. This last
process is referred to as {\em query by construction}, and is the {\em
constructive phase} of the query formulation process.</span>

of symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations
(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical
SAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian
distribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel
data-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their
discretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data
compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss
and mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented
for high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is
shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic
process that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate
piecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional
information loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed
representations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX
method. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets
demonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an
alternative data-driven SAX variant.</span>

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users&#x27; demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.</span>

                                        <span>Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental building block in
information retrieval with graph-based indices being the current
state-of-the-art and widely used in the industry. Recent advances in
graph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point
datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity
machine with an SSD.

However, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that
cannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world
scenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email, or a news index). To
overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates
into such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be
prohibitively expensive.

In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects
corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search
performance. Using update rules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a
system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and
limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes
and searches per second each, while retaining $&gt;95\%$ 5-recall@5. This
represents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices
when compared to existing methods.</span>

                                        <span>An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural
document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -
e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based
document ranking models.</span>

application of recommender systems. Generally speaking, interacted examples are
considered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted
ones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A
noisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative
user preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of
unawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference.
Conventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to
sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose probabilistic and
variational recommendation denoising for implicit feedback. Through an
empirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar
predictions on clean examples which denote the real user preference, while the
predictions on noisy examples vary much more across different models. Motivated
by this observation, we propose denoising with probabilistic inference (DPI)
which aims to minimize the KL-divergence between the real user preference
distributions parameterized by two recommendation models while maximize the
likelihood of data observation. We then show that DPI recovers the evidence
lower bound of an variational auto-encoder when the real user preference is
considered as the latent variables. This leads to our second learning framework
denoising with variational autoencoder (DVAE). We employ the proposed DPI and
DVAE on four state-of-the-art recommendation models and conduct experiments on
three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DPI and DVAE
significantly improve recommendation performance compared with normal training
and other denoising methods. Codes will be open-sourced.</span>

                                        <span>In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all
images in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size
which facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a
computational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance
due to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the
MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.</span>

samples and among features. The Kronecker sum or the Cartesian product of two
graphs, each modeling dependencies across features and across samples, has been
used as an inverse covariance matrix for a matrix-variate Gaussian
distribution, as an alternative to a Kronecker-product inverse covariance
matrix, due to its more intuitive sparse structure. However, the existing
methods for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse covariance estimation are limited in
that they do not scale to more than a few hundred features and samples and that
the unidentifiable parameters pose challenges in estimation. In this paper, we
introduce EiGLasso, a highly scalable method for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse
covariance estimation, based on Newton&#x27;s method combined with
eigendecomposition of the two graphs for exploiting the structure of Kronecker
sum. EiGLasso further reduces computation time by approximating the Hessian
based on the eigendecomposition of the sample and feature graphs. EiGLasso
achieves quadratic convergence with the exact Hessian and linear convergence
with the approximate Hessian. We describe a simple new approach to estimating
the unidentifiable parameters that generalizes the existing methods. On
simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that EiGLasso achieves two to
three orders-of-magnitude speed-up compared to the existing methods.</span>

optimization of queueing systems. In recent years, techniques from supervised
learning, bandit learning and reinforcement learning have been applied to
queueing systems supported by increasing role of information in decision
making. We present observations and new results that help rationalize the
application of these areas to queueing systems.

We prove that the MaxWeight and BackPressure policies are an application of
Blackwell&#x27;s Approachability Theorem. This connects queueing theoretic results
with adversarial learning. We then discuss the requirements of statistical
learning for service parameter estimation. As an example, we show how queue
size regret can be bounded when applying a perceptron algorithm to classify
service. Next, we discuss the role of state information in improved decision
making. Here we contrast the roles of epistemic information (information on
uncertain parameters) and aleatoric information (information on an uncertain
state). Finally we review recent advances in the theory of reinforcement
learning and queueing, as well as, provide discussion on current research

Manually labeling data is a very expensive and daunting task. This calls for
unsupervised learning techniques that are powerful enough to achieve comparable
results as semi-supervised/supervised techniques. Contrastive self-supervised
learning has emerged as a powerful direction, in some cases outperforming
supervised techniques. In this study, we propose, SelfGNN, a novel contrastive
self-supervised graph neural network (GNN) without relying on explicit
contrastive terms. We leverage Batch Normalization, which introduces implicit
contrastive terms, without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, as data
augmentation is key in contrastive learning, we introduce four feature
augmentation (FA) techniques for graphs. Though graph topological augmentation
(TA) is commonly used, our empirical findings show that FA perform as good as
TA. Moreover, FA incurs no computational overhead, unlike TA, which often has
O(N^3) time complexity, N-number of nodes. Our empirical evaluation on seven
publicly available real-world data shows that, SelfGNN is powerful and leads to
a performance comparable with SOTA supervised GNNs and always better than SOTA
semi-supervised and unsupervised GNNs. The source code is available at

algorithms need many rounds to converge, one-shot federated learning (i.e.,
federated learning with a single communication round) is a promising approach
to make federated learning applicable in cross-silo setting in practice.
However, existing one-shot algorithms only support specific models and do not

algorithm named FedKT. By utilizing the knowledge transfer technique, FedKT can
be applied to any classification models and can flexibly achieve differential

due to the &#x60;reality gap&#x27; where the simulator is unable to accurately capture
the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to
tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and
engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to
learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too
conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system
parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world
without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to
reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively
shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system
parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of
observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the
given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate
the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in
both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement
over naive domain randomization. Project videos and code at

provide a new angle to study such issues under the setting of a fixed number of
model parameters which in general is the most dominant cost factor. We
introduce a notion of variability and show that it correlates positively to the
activation ratio and negatively to a phenomenon called {Collapse to Constants}
(or C2C), which is closely related but not identical to the phenomenon commonly
known as vanishing gradient. Experiments on a styled model problem empirically
verify that variability is indeed a key performance indicator for fully

                                        <span>In the problem of multiple support recovery, we are given access to linear
measurements of multiple sparse samples in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. These samples can
be partitioned into $\ell$ groups, with samples having the same support
belonging to the same group. For a given budget of $m$ measurements per sample,
the goal is to recover the $\ell$ underlying supports, in the absence of the
knowledge of group labels. We study this problem with a focus on the
measurement-constrained regime where $m$ is smaller than the support size $k$
of each sample. We design a two-step procedure that estimates the union of the
underlying supports first, and then uses a spectral algorithm to estimate the
individual supports. Our proposed estimator can recover the supports with $m&lt;k$
measurements per sample, from $\tilde{O}(k^{4}\ell^{4}/m^{4})$ samples. Our
guarantees hold for a general, generative model assumption on the samples and
measurement matrices. We also provide results from experiments conducted on
synthetic data and on the MNIST dataset.</span>

proposed as a supplement to the definitive RT-PCR test. We present a deep
learning ensemble for detecting COVID-19 infection, combining slice-based (2D)
and volume-based (3D) approaches. The 2D system detects the infection on each
CT slice independently, combining them to obtain the patient-level decision via
different methods (averaging and long-short term memory networks). The 3D
system takes the whole CT volume to arrive to the patient-level decision in one
step. A new high resolution chest CT scan dataset, called the IST-C dataset, is
also collected in this work. The proposed ensemble, called IST-CovNet, obtains
90.80% accuracy and 0.95 AUC score overall on the IST-C dataset in detecting
COVID-19 among normal controls and other types of lung pathologies; and 93.69%
accuracy and 0.99 AUC score on the publicly available MosMed dataset that
consists of COVID-19 scans and normal controls only. The system is deployed at
Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine.</span>

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs&#x27; performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>Large ride-hailing platforms, such as DiDi, Uber and Lyft, connect tens of
thousands of vehicles in a city to millions of ride demands throughout the day,
providing great promises for improving transportation efficiency through the
tasks of order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. Existing studies,
however, usually consider the two tasks in simplified settings that hardly
address the complex interactions between the two, the real-time fluctuations
between supply and demand, and the necessary coordinations due to the
large-scale nature of the problem. In this paper we propose a unified
value-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both tasks. At the
center of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated
continuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform
transactions. To improve the sample-efficiency and the robustness, we further
propose a novel periodic ensemble method combining the fast online learning
with a large-scale offline training scheme that leverages the abundant
historical driver trajectory data. This allows the proposed framework to adapt
quickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent
patterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed
vehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably
improvements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks. Particularly,
V1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning
tracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results
on improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Chest X-rays of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are frequently
obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest
X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal
shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,
and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To
accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available
chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage
existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection &quot;chest X-ray&quot;
images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an
automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays
comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest
X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On
a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model
achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a
dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50
projections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines
with limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity
quantification on chest X-rays.</span>

                                        <span>While programming is one of the most broadly applicable skills in modern
society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted
settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary
natural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this
specification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,
we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our
benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line
solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large
language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the
prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as
GPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,
so we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As
the social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming
years, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking
advancements.</span>

                                        <span>In recommendation systems, the existence of the missing-not-at-random (MNAR)
problem results in the selection bias issue, degrading the recommendation
performance ultimately. A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing
entries from the so-called &quot;exposure&quot; perspective, i.e., modeling how an item
is exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic
models or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the
missing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how
the ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we
propose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding
in Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In
general, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors
(e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network&#x27;s perspective.
Particularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social
network confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We
also develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning
to retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize
well on the rating prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate
that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

information and minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) of sparse linear regression in
the sub-linear sparsity regime. Our result is achieved by a generalization of
the adaptive interpolation method in Bayesian inference for linear regimes to
sub-linear ones. A modification of the well-known approximate message passing
algorithm to approach the MMSE fundamental limit is also proposed, and its
state evolution is rigorously analysed. Our results show that the traditional
linear assumption between the signal dimension and number of observations in
the replica and adaptive interpolation methods is not necessary for sparse

recognition becomes a key component to deliver relevant search results. Errors
introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) lead to irrelevant search
results returned to the user, thus causing user dissatisfaction. In this paper,
we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space
without depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to
system constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run
on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several
proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making
internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis
showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries
is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR
systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant
improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in
one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as
complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not
be frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts.</span>

the common network threats nowadays have the characteristics of varieties and
variation. Considering the serious imbalance of intrusion detection datasets
will result in low classification performance on attack behaviors of small
sample size and difficulty to detect network attacks accurately and
efficiently, using Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) method to balance
datasets was proposed in this paper. In addition, Random Forest algorithm was
used to train intrusion detection classifiers. Through the comparative
experiment of Intrusion detection on CICIDS 2017 dataset, it is found that
ADASYN with Random Forest performs better. Based on the experimental results,
the improvement of precision, recall, F1 scores and AUC values after ADASYN is
then analyzed. Experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to
intrusion detection with large data, and can effectively improve the
classification accuracy of network attack behaviors. Compared with traditional
machine learning models, it has better performance, generalization ability and
robustness.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we investigate a new multi-armed bandit (MAB) online learning
model that considers real-world phenomena in many recommender systems: (i) the
learning agent cannot pull the arms by itself and thus has to offer rewards to
users to incentivize arm-pulling indirectly; and (ii) if users with specific
arm preferences are well rewarded, they induce a &quot;self-reinforcing&quot; effect in
the sense that they will attract more users of similar arm preferences. Besides
addressing the tradeoff of exploration and exploitation, another key feature of
this new MAB model is to balance reward and incentivizing payment. The goal of
the agent is to maximize the total reward over a fixed time horizon $T$ with a
low total payment. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: (i) We propose
a new MAB model with random arm selection that considers the relationship of
users&#x27; self-reinforcing preferences and incentives; and (ii) We leverage the
properties of a multi-color Polya urn with nonlinear feedback model to propose
two MAB policies termed &quot;At-Least-$n$ Explore-Then-Commit&quot; and &quot;UCB-List&quot;. We
prove that both policies achieve $O(log T)$ expected regret with $O(log T)$
expected payment over a time horizon $T$. We conduct numerical simulations to
demonstrate and verify the performances of these two policies and study their
robustness under various settings.</span>

Canadian men is diagnosed with this cancer in their lifetime. Super-Resolution
(SR) can facilitate early diagnosis and potentially save many lives. In this
paper, a robust and accurate model is proposed for prostate MRI SR. The model
is trained on the Prostate-Diagnosis and PROSTATEx datasets. The proposed model
outperformed the state-of-the-art prostate SR model in all similarity metrics

                                        <span>Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to improve software reliability.
Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) techniques have been used to fix
software bugs automatically. While promising, these approaches have two major
limitations. Their search space often does not contain the correct fix, and
their search strategy ignores software knowledge such as strict code syntax.
Due to these limitations, existing NMT-based techniques underperform the best
template-based approaches.

We propose CURE, a new NMT-based APR technique with three major novelties.
First, CURE pre-trains a programming language (PL) model on a large software
codebase to learn developer-like source code before the APR task. Second, CURE
designs a new code-aware search strategy that finds more correct fixes by
focusing on compilable patches and patches that are close in length to the
buggy code. Finally, CURE uses a subword tokenization technique to generate a
smaller search space that contains more correct fixes.

Our evaluation on two widely-used benchmarks shows that CURE correctly fixes
57 Defects4J bugs and 26 QuixBugs bugs, outperforming all existing APR
techniques on both benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Determining the noise parameters of a Kalman Filter (KF) has been studied for
decades. A huge body of research focuses on the task of estimation of the noise
under various conditions, since precise noise estimation is considered
equivalent to minimization of the filtering errors. However, we show that even
a small violation of the KF assumptions can significantly modify the effective
noise, breaking the equivalence between the tasks and making noise estimation
an inferior strategy. We show that such violations are very common, and are
often not trivial to handle or even notice. Consequentially, we argue that a
robust solution is needed - rather than choosing a dedicated model per problem.
To that end, we apply gradient-based optimization to the filtering errors
directly, with relation to a simple and efficient parameterization of the
symmetric and positive-definite parameters of KF. In radar tracking and video
tracking, we show that the optimization improves both the accuracy of KF and
its robustness to design decisions. In addition, we demonstrate how an
optimized neural network model can seem to reduce the errors significantly
compared to a KF - and how this reduction vanishes once the KF is optimized
similarly. This indicates how complicated models can be wrongly identified as
superior to KF, while in fact they were merely more optimized.</span>

region is crucial for decision-makers wishing to reduce the impact of pollution
on public health through active measures (e.g. temporary traffic closures). In
this study, we present a machine learning approach applied to the forecast of
the day-ahead maximum value of the ozone concentration for several geographical
locations in southern Switzerland. Due to the low density of measurement
stations and to the complex orography of the use case terrain, we adopted
feature selection methods instead of explicitly restricting relevant features
to a neighbourhood of the prediction sites, as common in spatio-temporal
forecasting methods. We then used Shapley values to assess the explainability
of the learned models in terms of feature importance and feature interactions
in relation to ozone predictions; our analysis suggests that the trained models
effectively learned explanatory cross-dependencies among atmospheric variables.
Finally, we show how weighting observations helps in increasing the accuracy of

                                        <span>Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style characteristics of one
image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches
commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face
limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial
locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial
success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations,
this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and
normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name
Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially
a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through
attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN
into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced
stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform
for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces
visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.</span>

                                        <span>The study of multi-type Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is fundamental for
understanding biological processes from a systematic perspective and revealing
disease mechanisms. Existing methods suffer from significant performance
degradation when tested in unseen dataset. In this paper, we investigate the
problem and find that it is mainly attributed to the poor performance for
inter-novel-protein interaction prediction. However, current evaluations
overlook the inter-novel-protein interactions, and thus fail to give an
instructive assessment. As a result, we propose to address the problem from
both the evaluation and the methodology. Firstly, we design a new evaluation
framework that fully respects the inter-novel-protein interactions and gives
consistent assessment across datasets. Secondly, we argue that correlations
between proteins must provide useful information for analysis of novel
proteins, and based on this, we propose a graph neural network based method
(GNN-PPI) for better inter-novel-protein interaction prediction. Experimental
results on real-world datasets of different scales demonstrate that GNN-PPI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods, especially
for the inter-novel-protein interaction prediction.</span>

better tools for adaptation. Floods, for example, are the most frequent natural
disaster, and better tools for flood risk communication could increase the
support for flood-resilient infrastructure development. Our work aims to enable
more visual communication of large-scale climate impacts via visualizing the
output of coastal flood models as satellite imagery. We propose the first deep
learning pipeline to ensure physical-consistency in synthetic visual satellite
imagery. We advanced a state-of-the-art GAN called pix2pixHD, such that it
produces imagery that is physically-consistent with the output of an
expert-validated storm surge model (NOAA SLOSH). By evaluating the imagery
relative to physics-based flood maps, we find that our proposed framework
outperforms baseline models in both physical-consistency and photorealism. We
envision our work to be the first step towards a global visualization of how
climate change shapes our landscape. Continuing on this path, we show that the
proposed pipeline generalizes to visualize arctic sea ice melt. We also publish
a dataset of over 25k labelled image-pairs to study image-to-image translation
in Earth observation.</span>

                                        <span>Data-driven individualized decision making has recently received increasing
research interests. Most existing methods rely on the assumption of no
unmeasured confounding, which unfortunately cannot be ensured in practice
especially in observational studies. Motivated by the recent proposed proximal
causal inference, we develop several proximal learning approaches to estimating
optimal individualized treatment regimes (ITRs) in the presence of unmeasured
confounding. In particular, we establish several identification results for
different classes of ITRs, exhibiting the trade-off between the risk of making
untestable assumptions and the value function improvement in decision making.
Based on these results, we propose several classification-based approaches to
finding a variety of restricted in-class optimal ITRs and develop their
theoretical properties. The appealing numerical performance of our proposed
methods is demonstrated via an extensive simulation study and one real data
application.</span>

from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error
rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a
sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine
translation by a large margin.</span>

                                        <span>(Artificial) neural networks have become increasingly popular in mechanics as
means to accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as
universal models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major
disadvantage of neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are
challenging to interpret and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled
as black boxes, and their results often elude human interpretation. In
mechanics, the new and active field of physics-informed neural networks
attempts to mitigate this disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the
basis of mechanical knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and
more complex neural networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions
could be explained. However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural
network parameters remain mysterious.

Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step
towards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on
mechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence
approach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their
high-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis
decorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows
the comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is
supported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the
best neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of
three case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,
elastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can
help identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize
new materials.</span>

                                        <span>Improving irradiance forecasting is critical to further increase the share of
solar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground
are used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the
electricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the
Sun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a
reference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking
methods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires
access to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an
image-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is
visible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We
validate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA&#x27;s
lab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth
Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size.</span>

                                        <span>For many reasoning-heavy tasks involving raw inputs, it is challenging to
design an appropriate end-to-end learning pipeline. Neuro-Symbolic Learning,
divide the process into sub-symbolic perception and symbolic reasoning, trying
to utilise data-driven machine learning and knowledge-driven reasoning
simultaneously. However, they suffer from the exponential computational
complexity within the interface between these two components, where the
sub-symbolic learning model lacks direct supervision, and the symbolic model
lacks accurate input facts. Hence, most of them assume the existence of a
strong symbolic knowledge base and only learn the perception model while
avoiding a crucial problem: where does the knowledge come from? In this paper,
we present Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning ($Meta_{Abd}$) that unites
abduction and induction to learn neural networks and induce logic theories
jointly from raw data. Experimental results demonstrate that $Meta_{Abd}$ not
only outperforms the compared systems in predictive accuracy and data
efficiency but also induces logic programs that can be re-used as background
knowledge in subsequent learning tasks. To the best of our knowledge,
$Meta_{Abd}$ is the first system that can jointly learn neural networks from
scratch and induce recursive first-order logic theories with predicate
invention.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and
industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number
of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to
manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different
graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine
learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine
learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community.
Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily
focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search
(NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to
automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first
dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our
insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning.
This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated
machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.</span>

symptoms shown by patients are not consistent, making it difficult to diagnose
in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although
researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis
and treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning needs
to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness
needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms
clinical application. To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of
patients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and
diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning
framework using multi-source data, which can extend any traditional machine
learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or
parties. Secondly, we adopt late fusion methods to solve the problem of
inconsistent time series of multi-view data. Finally, we compare the federated
framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss
the related results.</span>

                                        <span>As big data becomes ubiquitous across domains, and more and more stakeholders
aspire to make the most of their data, demand for machine learning tools has
spurred researchers to explore the possibilities of automated machine learning
(AutoML). AutoML tools aim to make machine learning accessible for non-machine
learning experts (domain experts), to improve the efficiency of machine
learning, and to accelerate machine learning research. But although automation
and efficiency are among AutoML&#x27;s main selling points, the process still
requires human involvement at a number of vital steps, including understanding
the attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating
a suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning
technique. These steps often require a prolonged back-and-forth that makes this
process inefficient for domain experts and data scientists alike, and keeps
so-called AutoML systems from being truly automatic. In this review article, we
introduce a new classification system for AutoML systems, using a seven-tiered
schematic to distinguish these systems based on their level of autonomy. We
begin by describing what an end-to-end machine learning pipeline actually looks
like, and which subtasks of the machine learning pipeline have been automated
so far. We highlight those subtasks which are still done manually - generally
by a data scientist - and explain how this limits domain experts&#x27; access to
machine learning. Next, we introduce our novel level-based taxonomy for AutoML
systems and define each level according to the scope of automation support
provided. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for the future, pinpointing the
research required to further automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline
and discussing important challenges that stand in the way of this ambitious
goal.</span>

                                        <span>This article addresses several fundamental issues associated with the
approximation theory of neural networks, including the characterization of
approximation spaces, the determination of the metric entropy of these spaces,
and approximation rates of neural networks. For any activation function
$\sigma$, we show that the largest Banach space of functions which can be
efficiently approximated by the corresponding shallow neural networks is the
space whose norm is given by the gauge of the closed convex hull of the set
$\{\pm\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}$. We characterize this space for the ReLU$^k$
and cosine activation functions and, in particular, show that the resulting
gauge space is equivalent to the spectral Barron space if $\sigma&#x3D;\cos$ and is
equivalent to the Barron space when $\sigma&#x3D;{\rm ReLU}$. Our main result
establishes the precise asymptotics of the $L^2$-metric entropy of the unit
ball of these guage spaces and, as a consequence, the optimal approximation
rates for shallow ReLU$^k$ networks. The sharpest previous results hold only in
the special case that $k&#x3D;0$ and $d&#x3D;2$, where the metric entropy has been
determined up to logarithmic factors. When $k &gt; 0$ or $d &gt; 2$, there is a
significant gap between the previous best upper and lower bounds. We close all
of these gaps and determine the precise asymptotics of the metric entropy for
all $k \geq 0$ and $d\geq 2$, including removing the logarithmic factors
previously mentioned. Finally, we use these results to quantify how much is
lost by Barron&#x27;s spectral condition relative to the convex hull of
$\{\pm\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}$ when $\sigma&#x3D;{\rm ReLU}^k$. Finally, we also
show that the orthogonal greedy algorithm can algorithmically realize the
improved approximation rates which have been derived.</span>

                                        <span>Proteins structure prediction has long been a grand challenge over the past
50 years, owing to its board scientific and application interests. There are
two major types of modelling algorithm, template-free modelling and
template-based modelling, which is suitable for easy prediction tasks, and is
widely adopted in computer aided drug discoveries for drug design and
screening. Although it has been several decades since its first edition, the
current template-based modeling approach suffers from two important problems:
1) there are many missing regions in the template-query sequence alignment, and
2) the accuracy of the distance pairs from different regions of the template
varies, and this information is not well introduced into the modeling. To solve
the two problems, we propose a structural optimization process based on
template modelling, introducing two neural network models predict the distance
information of the missing regions and the accuracy of the distance pairs of
different regions in the template modeling structure. The predicted distances
and residue pairwise specific accuracy information are incorporated into the
potential energy function for structural optimization, which significantly
improves the qualities of the original template modelling decoys.</span>

                                        <span>For electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES) batteries, thermal runaway
is a critical issue as it can lead to uncontrollable fires or even explosions.
Thermal anomaly detection can identify problematic battery packs that may
eventually undergo thermal runaway. However, there are common challenges like
data unavailability, environment and configuration variations, and battery
aging. We propose a data-driven method to detect battery thermal anomaly based
on comparing shape-similarity between thermal measurements. Based on their
shapes, the measurements are continuously being grouped into different
clusters. Anomaly is detected by monitoring deviations within the clusters.
Unlike model-based or other data-driven methods, the proposed method is robust
to data loss and requires minimal reference data for different pack
configurations. As the initial experimental results show, the method not only
can be more accurate than the onboard BMS and but also can detect unforeseen
anomalies at the early stage.</span>

seasonal forecasting models, such as for predicting El Ni\~no-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). However, current deep learning models are based on
convolutional neural networks which are difficult to interpret and can fail to
model large-scale atmospheric patterns. In comparison, graph neural networks
(GNNs) are capable of modeling large-scale spatial dependencies and are more
interpretable due to the explicit modeling of information flow through edge
connections. We propose the first application of graph neural networks to
seasonal forecasting. We design a novel graph connectivity learning module that
enables our GNN model to learn large-scale spatial interactions jointly with
the actual ENSO forecasting task. Our model, \graphino, outperforms
state-of-the-art deep learning-based models for forecasts up to six months
ahead. Additionally, we show that our model is more interpretable as it learns
sensible connectivity structures that correlate with the ENSO anomaly pattern.</span>

                                        <span>Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad application
of artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues to be a poorly
understood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of work on catastrophic
forgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how exactly the phenomenon should
be quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when
designing learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use
various testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning
literature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern
gradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant
impact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that-surprisingly-in
many instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less
catastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We
empirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying
catastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning
systems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the
metric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to
change the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much
more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic
forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in
supervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics
concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must-at the
very least-be measured with pairwise interference.</span>

invertibility of the network by satisfying the Lipschitz constant. Furthermore,
we propose a learnable weighted concatenation, which not only improves the

out-performs Residual Flow and other flow-based models on density estimation
evaluated in bits per dimension, where we utilize an equal parameter budget.
Moreover, we show that the proposed model out-performs Residual Flows when

system such that its evolution fits observational data. The physical model can
subsequently be evolved into the future to make predictions. This principle is
a cornerstone of large scale forecasting applications such as numerical weather
prediction. As such, it is implemented in current operational systems of
weather forecasting agencies across the globe. However, finding a good initial
state poses a difficult optimization problem in part due to the non-invertible
relationship between physical states and their corresponding observations. We
learn a mapping from observational data to physical states and show how it can
be used to improve optimizability. We employ this mapping in two ways: to
better initialize the non-convex optimization problem, and to reformulate the
objective function in better behaved physics space instead of observation
space. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional
turbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves
forecast quality for chaotic systems.</span>

                                        <span>Tensor completion refers to the task of estimating the missing data from an
incomplete measurement or observation, which is a core problem frequently
arising from the areas of big data analysis, computer vision, and network
engineering. Due to the multidimensional nature of high-order tensors, the
matrix approaches, e.g., matrix factorization and direct matricization of
tensors, are often not ideal for tensor completion and recovery. In this paper,
we introduce a unified low-rank and sparse enhanced Tucker decomposition model
for tensor completion. Our model possesses a sparse regularization term to
promote a sparse core tensor of the Tucker decomposition, which is beneficial
for tensor data compression. Moreover, we enforce low-rank regularization terms
on factor matrices of the Tucker decomposition for inducing the low-rankness of
the tensor with a cheap computational cost. Numerically, we propose a
customized ADMM with enough easy subproblems to solve the underlying model. It
is remarkable that our model is able to deal with different types of real-world
data sets, since it exploits the potential periodicity and inherent correlation
properties appeared in tensors. A series of computational experiments on
real-world data sets, including internet traffic data sets, color images, and
face recognition, demonstrate that our model performs better than many existing
state-of-the-art matricization and tensorization approaches in terms of
achieving higher recovery accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>While deep reinforcement learning excels at solving tasks where large amounts
of data can be collected through virtually unlimited interaction with the
environment, learning from limited interaction remains a key challenge. We
posit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward
maximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual
input and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method,
Self-Predictive Representations(SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent
state representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target
representations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential
moving average of the agent&#x27;s parameters and we make predictions using a
learned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective
outperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further
improve performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss,
which forces the agent&#x27;s representations to be consistent across multiple views
of an observation. Our full self-supervised objective, which combines future
prediction and data augmentation, achieves a median human-normalized score of
0.415 on Atari in a setting limited to 100k steps of environment interaction,
which represents a 55% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.
Notably, even in this limited data regime, SPR exceeds expert human scores on 7
out of 26 games. The code associated with this work is available at

                                        <span>We study the problem of learning-based attacks in linear systems, where the
communication channel between the controller and the plant can be hijacked by a
malicious attacker. We assume the attacker learns the dynamics of the system
from observations, then overrides the controller&#x27;s actuation signal, while
mimicking legitimate operation by providing fictitious sensor readings to the
controller. On the other hand, the controller is on a lookout to detect the
presence of the attacker and tries to enhance the detection performance by
carefully crafting its control signals. We study the trade-offs between the
information acquired by the attacker from observations, the detection
capabilities of the controller, and the control cost. Specifically, we provide
tight upper and lower bounds on the expected $\epsilon$-deception time, namely
the time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the presence
of an attacker with confidence at least $(1-\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$. We then
show a probabilistic lower bound on the time that must be spent by the attacker
learning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected
$\epsilon$-deception time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in
the sense that if the attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning
algorithm with the given order expected deception time. Finally, we show a
lower bound on the expected energy expenditure required to guarantee detection
with confidence at least $1-\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon)$.</span>

                                        <span>Contextual word embedding models, such as BioBERT and Bio_ClinicalBERT, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in biomedical natural language processing
tasks by focusing their pre-training process on domain-specific corpora.
However, such models do not take into consideration expert domain knowledge.

In this work, we introduced UmlsBERT, a contextual embedding model that
integrates domain knowledge during the pre-training process via a novel
knowledge augmentation strategy. More specifically, the augmentation on
UmlsBERT with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus was
performed in two ways: i) connecting words that have the same underlying
&#x60;concept&#x27; in UMLS, and ii) leveraging semantic group knowledge in UMLS to
create clinically meaningful input embeddings. By applying these two
strategies, UmlsBERT can encode clinical domain knowledge into word embeddings
and outperform existing domain-specific models on common named-entity
recognition (NER) and clinical natural language inference clinical NLP tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Advances in the motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a
subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a
novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This
study indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop
MI-based BCI applications for new users without the need for calibration.</span>

quantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the
intrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying
susceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue
susceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve
accuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch
between the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the
susceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning
architecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical
model, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the
relationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility
tensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The
convolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a
regularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by
ki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative
evaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed
deep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior
performance, demonstrating its potential for future applications.</span>

number $x\in[0,1]$ using a single bit. A sender that knows $x$ chooses a value
$X\in\set{0,1}$ to transmit. In turn, a receiver estimates $x$ based on the
value of $X$. We consider both the biased and unbiased estimation problems and
aim to minimize the cost. For the biased case, the cost is the worst-case (over
the choice of $x$) expected squared error, which coincides with the variance if
the algorithm is required to be unbiased.

We first overview common biased and unbiased estimation approaches and prove
their optimality when no shared randomness is allowed. We then show how a small
amount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the
cost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable
by any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose
near-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,
we discuss open problems and future directions.</span>

generation of a drum pattern that could be further used as a foundation for

that encode their local neighborhoods but not their positions. Consequently,
two nodes that are vastly distant but located in similar local neighborhoods
map to similar embeddings in those networks. This limitation prevents accurate
performance in predictive tasks that rely on position information. In this
paper,we develop GraphReach, a position-aware inductive GNN that captures the
global positions of nodes through reachability estimations with respect to a
set of anchor nodes. The anchors are strategically selected so that
reachability estimations across all the nodes are maximized. We show that this
combinatorial anchor selection problem is NP-hard and, consequently, develop a
greedy (1-1/e) approximation heuristic. Empirical evaluation against
state-of-the-art GNN architectures reveal that GraphReach provides up to 40%
relative improvement in accuracy. In addition, it is more robust to adversarial
attacks.</span>

behaviors of users provide rich information for digging into the users&#x27; fraud
risk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a
long-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information
and provide explainable prediction results. In fact, the value variations of
same field from different events and the interactions of different fields
inside one event have proven to be strong indicators for fraudulent behaviors.
In this paper, we propose the Dual Importance-aware Factorization Machines
(DIFM), which exploits the internal field information among users&#x27; behavior
sequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field
interactions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed
in the risk management system of one of the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce
platforms, which utilize it to provide real-time transaction fraud detection.
Experimental results on real industrial data from different regions in the
platform clearly demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements
compared with various state-of-the-art baseline models. Moreover, the DIFM
could also give an insight into the explanation of the prediction results from
dual perspectives.</span>

                                        <span>Attention layers are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and are
beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large
transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once
trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,
it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.
This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.
Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query
projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables
heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of
parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query
dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and
vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained
multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.
Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query
projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, deep neural networks have been successful in both industry
and academia, especially for computer vision tasks. The great success of deep
learning is mainly due to its scalability to encode large-scale data and to
maneuver billions of model parameters. However, it is a challenge to deploy
these cumbersome deep models on devices with limited resources, e.g., mobile
phones and embedded devices, not only because of the high computational
complexity but also the large storage requirements. To this end, a variety of
model compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As a
representative type of model compression and acceleration, knowledge
distillation effectively learns a small student model from a large teacher
model. It has received rapid increasing attention from the community. This
paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation from the
perspectives of knowledge categories, training schemes, teacher-student
architecture, distillation algorithms, performance comparison and applications.
Furthermore, challenges in knowledge distillation are briefly reviewed and
comments on future research are discussed and forwarded.</span>

                                        <span>To rapidly process temporal information at a low metabolic cost, biological
neurons integrate inputs as an analog sum but communicate with spikes, binary
events in time. Analog neuromorphic hardware uses the same principles to
emulate spiking neural networks with exceptional energy-efficiency. However,
instantiating high-performing spiking networks on such hardware remains a
significant challenge due to device mismatch and the lack of efficient training
algorithms. Here, we introduce a general in-the-loop learning framework based
on surrogate gradients that resolves these issues. Using the BrainScaleS-2
neuromorphic system, we show that learning self-corrects for device mismatch
resulting in competitive spiking network performance on both vision and speech
benchmarks. Our networks display sparse spiking activity with, on average, far
less than one spike per hidden neuron and input, perform inference at rates of
up to 85 k frames/second, and consume less than 200 mW. In summary, our work
sets several new benchmarks for low-energy spiking network processing on analog
neuromorphic hardware and paves the way for future on-chip learning algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of the estimation of a high-dimensional probability
distribution from i.i.d. samples of the distribution using model classes of
functions in tree-based tensor formats, a particular case of tensor networks
associated with a dimension partition tree. The distribution is assumed to
admit a density with respect to a product measure, possibly discrete for
handling the case of discrete random variables.

After discussing the representation of classical model classes in tree-based
tensor formats, we present learning algorithms based on empirical risk
minimization using a $L^2$ contrast.

These algorithms exploit the multilinear parametrization of the formats to
recast the nonlinear minimization problem into a sequence of empirical risk
minimization problems with linear models. A suitable parametrization of the
tensor in tree-based tensor format allows to obtain a linear model with
orthogonal bases, so that each problem admits an explicit expression of the
solution and cross-validation risk estimates. These estimations of the risk
enable the model selection, for instance when exploiting sparsity in the
coefficients of the representation.

A strategy for the adaptation of the tensor format (dimension tree and
tree-based ranks) is provided, which allows to discover and exploit some
specific structures of high-dimensional probability distributions such as
independence or conditional independence.

We illustrate the performances of the proposed algorithms for the
approximation of classical probabilistic models (such as Gaussian distribution,
graphical models, Markov chain).</span>

However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks
tobe able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited
computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning
techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning
pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et
al. (2018) has shown promising results when pruning at initialization. However,
for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned
networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one
layer from being fully pruned. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of Magnitude and Gradient based pruning at initialization
and training of sparse architectures. This allows us to propose novel
principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of NN

MS Windows 10 computer users over 8 weeks and submitted this data to
comprehensive machine learning analysis involving a diverse set of online and

potential to uniquely characterize computer users (with a maximum F-score of
99.94%); (ii) network-related events were the most useful features to properly
recognize profiles (95.14% of the top features distinguishing users being
network-related); (iii) user profiles were mostly inconsistent over the 8-week
data collection period, with 92.86% of users exhibiting drifts in terms of time
and usage habits; and (iv) online models are better suited to handle computer
usage profiles compared to offline models (maximum F-score for each approach

                                        <span>Interactive news recommendation has been launched and attracted much
attention recently. In this scenario, user&#x27;s behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user&#x27;s preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user&#x27;s demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user&#x27;s interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.</span>

                                        <span>There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks
to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from human&#x27;s visual and intuitive perspective. We take
the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique
to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.
The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored
Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it
using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an
overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are
selected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the
effectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study
of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for
the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological
indices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception
augmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and
augmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology
study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.</span>

when fine-grained features or in our case rarely occurring anomalies are to be
detected. Current contributions point to the problem of how high-dimensional
data can be fused. In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data
description algorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using
three different fusion techniques i.e. early fusion, late fusion, and late
fusion with multiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with
a denoising process to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves
the performance (ROC AUC &#x3D; 80\%). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset
that consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple
perspectives, with 5\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g. drill
holes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset
using images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard
MNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
exceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on addressing
multi-perspective anomaly detection in images by jointly using different
perspectives together with one single objective function for anomaly detection.</span>

better understanding of the complexity of trajectory prediction tasks and

an approach for quantifying the amount of information contained in a dataset

conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core
of $2.1$--$2.7$~GHz CPU on a real-time factor of $0.87$--$0.95$, including
input/output, feature extraction, on a frame shift of $10$ ms, a window length

                                        <span>Recommender systems are gaining increasing and critical impacts on human and
society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users&#x27; demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized

and symmetries can be done by deep learning. The constraints can be either
imposed as terms in a loss function or used to formulate a neural ansatz. In
the present case study, we calculate the induced field inside and outside a
dielectric cube placed in a uniform electric field, wherein the dielectric
mismatch at edges and corners of the cube makes accurate calculations
numerically challenging. The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz
incorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries
and the Laplace&#x27;s equation is then solved with boundary conditions at the
dielectric interface by minimizing a loss function. The loss function ensures
that both Laplace&#x27;s equation and boundary conditions are satisfied everywhere
inside a large solution domain. We study how the electric potential inside and
outside a quasi-cubic particle evolves through a sequence of shapes from a
sphere to a cube. The neural network being differentiable, it is
straightforward to calculate the electric field over the whole domain, the
induced surface charge distribution and the polarizability. The neural network
being retentive, one can efficiently follow how the field changes upon
particle&#x27;s shape or dielectric constant by iterating from any previously
converged solution. The present work&#x27;s objective is two-fold, first to show how
an a priori knowledge can be incorporated into neural networks to achieve
efficient learning and second to apply the method and study how the induced
field and polarizability change when a dielectric particle progressively
changes its shape from a sphere to a cube.</span>

vocoder framework based on multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction
for discrete waveform modeling (MWDLP). MWDLP employs a coarse-fine bit WaveRNN
architecture for 10-bit mu-law waveform modeling. A sparse gated recurrent unit
with a relatively large size of hidden units is utilized, while the multiband
modeling is deployed to achieve real-time low-latency usage. A novel technique
for data-driven linear prediction (LP) with discrete waveform modeling is
proposed, where the LP coefficients are estimated in a data-driven manner.
Moreover, a novel loss function using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for
discrete waveform modeling with Gumbel approximation is also proposed. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MWDLP framework generates
high-fidelity synthetic speech for seen and unseen speakers and/or language on
300 speakers training data including clean and noisy/reverberant conditions,
where the number of training utterances is limited to 60 per speaker, while
allowing for real-time low-latency processing using a single core of $\sim\!$
2.1--2.7~GHz CPU with $\sim\!$ 0.57--0.64 real-time factor including

to achieve strong performance, making the problem of Hyperparameter
Optimization (HPO) more important than ever. Here, we combine the advantages of
the popular bandit-based HPO method Hyperband (HB) and the evolutionary search
approach of Differential Evolution (DE) to yield a new HPO method which we call
DEHB. Comprehensive results on a very broad range of HPO problems, as well as a
wide range of tabular benchmarks from neural architecture search, demonstrate
that DEHB achieves strong performance far more robustly than all previous HPO
methods we are aware of, especially for high-dimensional problems with discrete
input dimensions. For example, DEHB is up to 1000x faster than random search.
It is also efficient in computational time, conceptually simple and easy to

challenging for time series due to the intractable marginal likelihoods of
flexible generative models. It can be addressed by surrogate objectives for
optimization. We propose Monte Carlo filtering objectives (MCFOs), a family of
variational objectives for jointly learning parametric generative models and
amortized adaptive importance proposals of time series. MCFOs extend the
choices of likelihood estimators beyond Sequential Monte Carlo in
state-of-the-art objectives, possess important properties revealing the factors
for the tightness of objectives, and allow for less biased and variant gradient
estimates. We demonstrate that the proposed MCFOs and gradient estimations lead
to efficient and stable model learning, and learned generative models well
explain data and importance proposals are more sample efficient on various
kinds of time series data.</span>

orientation of the moving object through analyzing the image sequences captured
by on-board cameras, has been well investigated with the rising interest in
autonomous driving. This paper studies monocular VO from the perspective of
Deep Learning (DL). Unlike most current learning-based methods, our approach,
called DeepAVO, is established on the intuition that features contribute
discriminately to different motion patterns. Specifically, we present a novel
four-branch network to learn the rotation and translation by leveraging
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus on different quadrants of optical
flow input. To enhance the ability of feature selection, we further introduce
an effective channel-spatial attention mechanism to force each branch to
explicitly distill related information for specific Frame to Frame (F2F) motion
estimation. Experiments on various datasets involving outdoor driving and
indoor walking scenarios show that the proposed DeepAVO outperforms the
state-of-the-art monocular methods by a large margin, demonstrating competitive
performance to the stereo VO algorithm and verifying promising potential for
generalization.</span>

from weights but not activations, which are dynamic, unpredictable, and hence

computation patterns in today&#x27;s DNN models, to exploit our new dual-side sparse

to its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,
there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease
diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective
radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a
sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep
leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that
utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt
models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training
dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the
transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging
domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this
circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network
(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR
images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits
important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using
graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is
not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of
extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three
class (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform
different benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned
drawbacks.</span>

tackles two commonly encountered problems in biomedical imaging: Topological
consistency of the segmentation, and limited annotations. We propose a
topological score which measures both topological and geometric consistency
between the predicted and ground truth segmentations, applied for model
selection and validation. We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.
a U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised
U-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training
the network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm. This allows us
to utilize un-annotated data for training a representation that generalizes
across test data variability, in spite of our annotated training data having
very limited variation. Our contributions are validated on a challenging

                                        <span>The Graph Augmented Multi-layer Perceptron (GA-MLP) model is an attractive
alternative to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This is because it is resistant to
the over-smoothing problem, and deeper GA-MLP models yield better performance.
GA-MLP models are traditionally optimized by the Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD). However, SGD suffers from the layer dependency problem, which prevents
the gradients of different layers of GA-MLP models from being calculated in
parallel. In this paper, we propose a parallel deep learning Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (pdADMM) framework to achieve model
parallelism: parameters in each layer of GA-MLP models can be updated in
parallel. The extended pdADMM-Q algorithm reduces communication cost by
utilizing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a critical
point of the pdADMM algorithm and the pdADMM-Q algorithm is provided with a
sublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$. Extensive experiments in six benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the pdADMM can lead to high speedup, and outperforms
all the existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.</span>

                                        <span>The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is
strongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based
methods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved
cerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features
and are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background
clutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the
whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.

Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety
movement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from
short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative
information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy
screening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an
Australian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,
significantly outperforming existing competing methods with better
interpretability.</span>

                                        <span>Smart home environments are designed to provide services that help improve
the quality of life for the occupant via a variety of sensors and actuators
installed throughout the space. Many automated actions taken by a smart home
are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system.
However, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate and
therefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead a user to wonder
&quot;why did the smart home do that?&quot; In this work, we build on insights from
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to contribute
computational methods for explainable activity recognition. Specifically, we
generate explanations for smart home activity recognition systems that explain
what about an activity led to the given classification. To do so, we introduce
four computational techniques for generating natural language explanations of
smart home data and compare their effectiveness at generating meaningful
explanations. Through a study with everyday users, we evaluate user preferences
towards the four explanation types. Our results show that the leading approach,
SHAP, has a 92% success rate in generating accurate explanations. Moreover, 84%
of sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a
simple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity
recognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI
methods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying
activity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking
all studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding
which existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart
home automation, and discuss a range of topics for future work in this area.</span>

different locations, the distributed nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is an
attractive tool for classification. We propose a novel distributed adaptive NN
classifier for which the number of nearest neighbors is a tuning parameter
stochastically chosen by a data-driven criterion. An early stopping rule is
proposed when searching for the optimal tuning parameter, which not only speeds
up the computation but also improves the finite sample performance of the
proposed Algorithm. Convergence rate of excess risk of the distributed adaptive
NN classifier is investigated under various sub-sample size compositions. In
particular, we show that when the sub-sample sizes are sufficiently large, the
proposed classifier achieves the nearly optimal convergence rate. Effectiveness
of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation studies as well as
an empirical application to a real-world dataset.</span>

                                        <span>There has been a rise in the use of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)
Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and
algorithms, which otherwise take a huge amount of resources if built from
scratch. As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it&#x27;s very
important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have
only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of
vision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods
and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s optical
character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world
settings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and
Microsoft Azure&#x27;s Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the
conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and
transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These
methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such
attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for
high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully
evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision
(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).
90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the
vision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s
optical character recognition. Complementing to current research, our results
provide simple but unconventional methods on robustness evaluation.</span>

reinforcement learning. The number of the constraints depends on the size of
state and action spaces, which makes the problem intractable in large or
continuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the
double-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional
expectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic
penalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling
and evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the
obstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the
intractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep
parameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the
replacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the
augmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general
theoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the
constrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the
error is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty
algorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be
arbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is
chosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is
competitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.</span>

applications, including surgical automation and visual feedback. In this study
we investigate localization and autonomous robotic control of needles in the
context of our magneto-suturing system. Our system holds the potential for
surgical manipulation with the benefit of minimal invasiveness and reduced
patient side effects. However, the non-linear magnetic fields produce
unintuitive forces and demand delicate position-based control that exceeds the
capabilities of direct human manipulation. This makes automatic needle
localization a necessity. Our localization method combines neural network-based
segmentation and classical techniques, and we are able to consistently locate
our needle with 0.73 mm RMS error in clean environments and 2.72 mm RMS error
in challenging environments with blood and occlusion. The average localization
RMS error is 2.16 mm for all environments we used in the experiments. We
combine this localization method with our closed-loop feedback control system
to demonstrate the further applicability of localization to autonomous control.
Our needle is able to follow a running suture path in (1) no blood, no tissue;
(2) heavy blood, no tissue; (3) no blood, with tissue; and (4) heavy blood,
with tissue environments. The tip position tracking error ranges from 2.6 mm to
3.7 mm RMS, opening the door towards autonomous suturing tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Distantly supervised (DS) relation extraction (RE) has attracted much
attention in the past few years as it can utilize large-scale auto-labeled
data. However, its evaluation has long been a problem: previous works either
took costly and inconsistent methods to manually examine a small sample of
model predictions, or directly test models on auto-labeled data -- which, by
our check, produce as much as 53% wrong labels at the entity pair level in the
popular NYT10 dataset. This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,
but also made it hard to understand where we are and what&#x27;s left to improve in
the research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we
build manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,
and thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest
pre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can
indicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some
unexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating
performance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to
previous methods. We hope that both our manual test sets and novel observations
can help advance future DS-RE research.</span>

biological neural networks. Various methods have been proposed for ensemble
inference from experimental data of neuronal activity. Among them, Bayesian
inference approach with generative model was proposed recently. However, this
method requires large computational cost for appropriate inference. In this

dependencies between variables of a joint probability distribution. A
fundamental task in data science is to learn a Bayesian network from observed
data. \textsc{Polytree Learning} is the problem of learning an optimal Bayesian
network that fulfills the additional property that its underlying undirected
graph is a forest. In this work, we revisit the complexity of \textsc{Polytree
Learning}. We show that \textsc{Polytree Learning} can be solved in $3^n \cdot
|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time where $n$ is the number of variables and $|I|$ is
the total instance size. Moreover, we consider the influence of the number of
variables $d$ that might receive a nonempty parent set in the final DAG on the
complexity of \textsc{Polytree Learning}. We show that \textsc{Polytree
Learning} has no $f(d)\cdot |I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm, unlike
Bayesian network learning which can be solved in $2^d \cdot
|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time. We show that, in contrast, if $d$ and the maximum
parent set size are bounded, then we can obtain efficient algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Background: Extensive clinical evidence suggests that a preventive screening
of coronary heart disease (CHD) at an earlier stage can greatly reduce the
mortality rate. We use 64 two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography
(2D-STE) features and seven clinical features to predict whether one has CHD.
Methods: We develop a machine learning approach that integrates a number of
popular classification methods together by model stacking, and generalize the
traditional stacking method to a two-step stacking method to improve the
diagnostic performance. Results: By borrowing strengths from multiple
classification models through the proposed method, we improve the CHD
classification accuracy from around 70% to 87.7% on the testing set. The
sensitivity of the proposed method is 0.903 and the specificity is 0.843, with
an AUC of 0.904, which is significantly higher than those of the individual
classification models. Conclusions: Our work lays a foundation for the
deployment of speckle tracking echocardiography-based screening tools for
coronary heart disease.</span>

                                        <span>Today, we are seeing an ever-increasing number of clinical notes that contain
clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of patient&#x27;s health state.
All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can
help people and domain experts with their common healthcare tasks. However,
many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.</span>

many organizations offer neural-networks based services as a black-box. The
reasons for hiding a learning model may vary: e.g., preventing copying of its

and revealing sensitive information about its training data.

However, even as a black-box, some information can still be discovered by

processes with history dependence. Here we propose an extended model where the
self--effects are of both excitatory and inhibitory type and follow a Gaussian
Process. Whereas previous work either relies on a less flexible
parameterization of the model, or requires a large amount of data, our
formulation allows for both a flexible model and learning when data are scarce.
We continue the line of work of Bayesian inference for Hawkes processes, and
our approach dispenses with the necessity of estimating a branching structure
for the posterior, as we perform inference on an aggregated sum of Gaussian
Processes. Efficient approximate Bayesian inference is achieved via data
augmentation, and we describe a mean--field variational inference approach to
learn the model parameters. To demonstrate the flexibility of the model we
apply our methodology on data from three different domains and compare it to
previously reported results.</span>

human-like behavior is the need to quickly and accurately quantify
human-likeness. While human assessments of such behavior can be highly
accurate, speed and scalability are limited. We address these limitations
through a novel automated Navigation Turing Test (ANTT) that learns to predict
human judgments of human-likeness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
automated NTT on a navigation task in a complex 3D environment. We investigate
six classification models to shed light on the types of architectures best
suited to this task, and validate them against data collected through a human
NTT. Our best models achieve high accuracy when distinguishing true human and
agent behavior. At the same time, we show that predicting finer-grained human
assessment of agents&#x27; progress towards human-like behavior remains unsolved.
Our work takes an important step towards agents that more effectively learn
complex human-like behavior.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, abstractive text summarization with multimodal inputs has
started drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from
different source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,
existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as
the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long
ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to
generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce
AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with
videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic
conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding
research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and
uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\name}, a factorized
multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently
captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input
modalities for the text summarization task. {\name} utilizes an increasing
number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly
better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments
illustrate that {\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for
short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse
duration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$
ROUGE-L points respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Due to the importance of the lower bounding distances and the attractiveness
of symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations
(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical
SAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian
distribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel
data-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their
discretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data
compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss
and mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented
for high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is
shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic
process that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate
piecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional
information loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed
representations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX
method. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets
demonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an
alternative data-driven SAX variant.</span>

                                        <span>The increasing concerns about data privacy and security drives the emergence
of a new field of studying privacy-preserving machine learning from isolated
data sources, i.e., \textit{federated learning}. Vertical federated learning,
where different parties hold different features for common users, has a great
potential of driving a more variety of business cooperation among enterprises
in different fields. Decision tree models especially decision tree ensembles
are a class of widely applied powerful machine learning models with high
interpretability and modeling efficiency. However, the interpretability are
compromised in these works such as SecureBoost since the feature names are not
exposed to avoid possible data breaches due to the unprotected decision path.
In this paper, we shall propose Fed-EINI, an efficient and interpretable
inference framework for federated decision tree models with only one round of
multi-party communication. We shall compute the candidate sets of leaf nodes
based on the local data at each party in parallel, followed by securely
computing the weight of the only leaf node in the intersection of the candidate
sets. We propose to protect the decision path by the efficient additively
homomorphic encryption method, which allows the disclosure of feature names and
thus makes the federated decision trees interpretable. The advantages of
Fed-EINI will be demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive
numerical results. Experiments show that the inference efficiency is improved
by over $50\%$ in average.</span>

                                        <span>Entanglement is a physical phenomenon, which has fueled recent successes of
quantum algorithms. Although quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown
promising results in solving simple machine learning tasks recently, for the
time being, the effect of entanglement in QNNs and the behavior of QNNs in
binary pattern classification are still underexplored. In this work, we provide
some theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and
analyzing a new form of invariance embedded in QNNs for both quantum binary
classification and quantum representation learning, which we term negational
symmetry. Given a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart where a
bitwise NOT operation is applied to each quantum bit of the binary signal, a
QNN outputs the same logits. That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a
quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification
task. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary
pattern classification tasks using Google&#x27;s quantum computing framework. The
theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a
fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our
findings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in
practical quantum applications.</span>

                                        <span>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) undergoes complicated multiplicative noise
for the mean-square loss. We use this property of the SGD noise to derive a
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with simpler additive noise by
performing a non-uniform transformation of the time variable. In the SDE, the
gradient of the loss is replaced by that of the logarithmized loss.
Consequently, we show that, near a local or global minimum, the stationary
distribution $P_\mathrm{ss}(\theta)$ of the network parameters $\theta$ follows
a power-law with respect to the loss function $L(\theta)$, i.e.
$P_\mathrm{ss}(\theta)\propto L(\theta)^{-\phi}$ with the exponent $\phi$
specified by the mini-batch size, the learning rate, and the Hessian at the
minimum. We obtain the escape rate formula from a local minimum, which is
determined not by the loss barrier height $\Delta L&#x3D;L(\theta^s)-L(\theta^*)$
between a minimum $\theta^*$ and a saddle $\theta^s$ but by the logarithmized
loss barrier height $\Delta\log L&#x3D;\log[L(\theta^s)/L(\theta^*)]$. Our
escape-rate formula explains an empirical fact that SGD prefers flat minima
with low effective dimensions.</span>

that form a general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation
functions. KNNs employ the Kronecker product, which provides an efficient way
of constructing a very wide network while keeping the number of parameters low.
Our theoretical analysis reveals that under suitable conditions, KNNs induce a
faster decay of the loss than that by the feed-forward networks. This is also
empirically verified through a set of computational examples. Furthermore,
under certain technical assumptions, we establish global convergence of
gradient descent for KNNs. As a specific case, we propose the Rowdy activation
function that is designed to get rid of any saturation region by injecting
sinusoidal fluctuations, which include trainable parameters. The proposed Rowdy
activation function can be employed in any neural network architecture like
feed-forward neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Convolutional neural
networks etc. The effectiveness of KNNs with Rowdy activation is demonstrated
through various computational experiments including function approximation
using feed-forward neural networks, solution inference of partial differential
equations using the physics-informed neural networks, and standard deep

such a situation, the importance of real-time economic analysis using

real-world problem; prediction of the number of job applicants which is closely

problems using numerical discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE),
we still cannot incorporate seamlessly noisy data into existing algorithms,
mesh-generation is complex, and we cannot tackle high-dimensional problems
governed by parametrized NSE. Moreover, solving inverse flow problems is often
prohibitively expensive and requires complex and expensive formulations and new
computer codes. Here, we review flow physics-informed learning, integrating

physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
PINNs for inverse problems related to three-dimensional wake flows, supersonic

                                        <span>Predicting links in complex networks has been one of the essential topics
within the realm of data mining and science discovery over the past few years.
This problem remains an attempt to identify future, deleted, and redundant
links using the existing links in a graph. Local random walk is considered to
be one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local
methods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a
limited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step
among the nodes which have equal importance. Then this method uses the
transition probability between node pairs to calculate the similarity between
them. However, in most datasets, this method is not able to perform accurately
in scoring remarkably similar nodes. In the present article, an efficient
method is proposed for improving local random walk by encouraging random walk
to move, in every step, towards the node which has a stronger influence.
Therefore, the next node is selected according to the influence of the source
node. To do so, using mutual information, the concept of the asymmetric mutual
influence of nodes is presented. A comparison between the proposed method and
other similarity-based methods (local, quasi-local, and global) has been
performed, and results have been reported for 11 real-world networks. It had a
higher prediction accuracy compared with other link prediction approaches.</span>

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an
emphasis on the quality of non-English language directions. Our intuition is
based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose \method, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mCOLT is empowered by two techniques: (i) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and (ii) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mCOLT achieves
competitive or even better performance than a strong pre-trained model mBART on
tens of WMT benchmarks. For non-English directions, mCOLT achieves an
improvement of average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual baseline.</span>

investment decisions and when patient safety is paramount, but machine learning
(ML) models in drug discovery typically provide only a single best estimate and
ignore all sources of uncertainty. Predictions from these models may therefore
be over-confident, which can put patients at risk and waste resources when
compounds that are destined to fail are further developed. Probabilistic
predictive models (PPMs) can incorporate uncertainty in both the data and
model, and return a distribution of predicted values that represents the
uncertainty in the prediction. PPMs not only let users know when predictions
are uncertain, but the intuitive output from these models makes communicating
risk easier and decision making better. Many popular machine learning methods
have a PPM or Bayesian analogue, making PPMs easy to fit into current
workflows. We use toxicity prediction as a running example, but the same
principles apply for all prediction models used in drug discovery. The
consequences of ignoring uncertainty and how PPMs account for uncertainty are
also described. We aim to make the discussion accessible to a broad
non-mathematical audience. Equations are provided to make ideas concrete for
mathematical readers (but can be skipped without loss of understanding) and

developed for solving multiphase flow in 3D heterogeneous porous media. The
model fully leverages the spatial topology predictive capability of
convolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient
continuity-based smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial
continuity. Furthermore, the transient regions are penalized to steer the
training process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these
regions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid
properties and well controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of
the state variables (pressure and saturation). While maintaining the continuity
of fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing
training cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training
data samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is
separately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on
the predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the
example of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the
physics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based
simulation data and emulates the physics process. The model performs prediction
with a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the
average temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%
and 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently
predicted by a surrogate model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than
5%. Therefore, with its unique scheme to cope with the fidelity in fluid flow
in porous media, the physics-constrained deep learning model can become an
efficient predictive model for computationally demanding inverse problems or
other coupled processes.</span>

and carbon dioxide (CO2) plume migration under geologic uncertainties is a
challenging problem in geologic carbon storage. The high computational cost of
data assimilation with a high-dimensional parameter space impedes fast
decision-making for commercial-scale reservoir management. We propose to
leverage physical understandings of porous medium flow behavior with deep
learning techniques to develop a fast history matching-reservoir response
forecasting workflow. Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation
framework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir
performance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes
interpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive
component in such a workflow is reservoir simulation, we developed surrogate
models to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well
injection. The surrogate models employ deep convolutional neural networks,
specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is
validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a
clastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to
bridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a
single-layer reservoir model. The workflow can complete history matching and
reservoir forecasting with uncertainty quantification in less than one hour on
a mainstream personal workstation.</span>

without quick medical intervention would lower the chances of survival for the
elderly, especially if living alone. Hence, the need is there for developing
fall detection algorithms with high accuracy. This paper presents a novel
IoT-based system for fall detection that includes a sensing device transmitting
data to a mobile application through a cloud-connected gateway device. Then,
the focus is shifted to the algorithmic aspect where multiple features are
extracted from 3-axis accelerometer data taken from existing datasets. The
results emphasize on the significance of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) as
an influential feature for determining falls. CWT, Signal Energy (SE), Signal
Magnitude Area (SMA), and Signal Vector Magnitude (SVM) features have shown
promising classification results using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and E-Nearest
Neighbors (ENN). For all performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision,
specificity, and F1 Score), the achieved results are higher than 95% for a
dataset of small size, while more than 98.47% score is achieved in the
aforementioned criteria over the UniMiB-SHAR dataset by the same algorithms,
where the classification time for a single test record is extremely efficient

                                        <span>Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research
interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation -- describing a shape as
a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point
clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used
in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential
and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for
existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and
natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.
We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and
random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset
consisting of 179,133 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made
this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.</span>

                                        <span>Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often
carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the
image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat
image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,
specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these
superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model
that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial
information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with
relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is
learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a &#x60;hybrid&#x27; loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:
COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint
Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel
information provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard
CNN-based vision systems.</span>

                                        <span>Non-stationary environments are challenging for reinforcement learning
algorithms. If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on
latent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that
maximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.
We call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions
such as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of
pre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or
boundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns
policies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream
of data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection
statistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created
and deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones
might be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until
unforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid
responses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in
order to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a
(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model
the different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We
evaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning
problems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and
model-based) RL algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art meta-learning methods
specially designed to deal with non-stationarity.</span>

multitude of sophisticated models and algorithms designed for various mining
tasks, such as ranking, classification, clustering and anomaly detection.
Generally speaking, the vast majority of the existing works aim to answer the
following question, that is, given a graph, what is the best way to mine it? In
this paper, we introduce the graph sanitation problem, to answer an orthogonal
question. That is, given a mining task and an initial graph, what is the best
way to improve the initially provided graph? By learning a better graph as part
of the input of the mining model, it is expected to benefit graph mining in a
variety of settings, ranging from denoising, imputation to defense. We
formulate the graph sanitation problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and
further instantiate it by semi-supervised node classification, together with an
effective solver named GaSoliNe. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method is (1) broadly applicable with respect to different
graph neural network models and flexible graph modification strategies, (2)
effective in improving the node classification accuracy on both the original
and contaminated graphs in various perturbation scenarios. In particular, it
brings up to 25% performance improvement over the existing robust graph neural
network methods.</span>

to avoid obstacles, especially with developments in tires, suspensions,
steering, as well as safety technologies like ABS, ESC, and more recently, ADAS
systems. However, environments around passenger vehicles have also become more
complex, and dangerous. There have previously been studies that outline driver
tendencies and performance capabilities when attempting to avoid obstacles
while driving passenger vehicles. Now that autonomous vehicles are being
developed with obstacle avoidance capabilities, it is important to target
performance that meets or exceeds that of human drivers. This manuscript
highlights systems that are crucial for an emergency obstacle avoidance
maneuver (EOAM) and identifies the state-of-the-art for each of the related
systems, while considering the nuances of traveling at highway speeds. Some of
the primary EOAM-related systems/areas that are discussed in this review are:
general path planning methods, system hierarchies, decision-making, trajectory

decides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the
detector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic
speed patterns they have observed. If similarity is found, DistTune directly
shares an existing LSTM model with this detector to achieve time-efficient
processing. Otherwise, DistTune customizes an LSTM model for the detector to
achieve fine-grained prediction. To make DistTune even more time-efficient,
DistTune performs on a cluster of computing nodes in parallel. To achieve
adaptive traffic speed prediction, DistTune also provides LSTM re-customization
for detectors that suffer from unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to for
instance traffic speed pattern change. Extensive experiments based on traffic
data collected from freeway I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the
performance of DistTune. The results demonstrate that DistTune provides
fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and adaptive traffic speed prediction
for a growing transportation network.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training among mutually
distrusting parties. Model updates, rather than training data, are concentrated
and fused in a central aggregation server. A key security challenge in FL is
that an untrustworthy or compromised aggregation process might lead to
unforeseeable information leakage. This challenge is especially acute due to
recently demonstrated attacks that have reconstructed large fractions of
training data from ostensibly &quot;sanitized&quot; model updates.

In this paper, we introduce TRUDA, a new cross-silo FL system, employing a
trustworthy and decentralized aggregation architecture to break down
information concentration with regard to a single aggregator. Based on the
unique computational properties of model-fusion algorithms, all exchanged model
updates in TRUDA are disassembled at the parameter-granularity and re-stitched
to random partitions designated for multiple TEE-protected aggregators. Thus,
each aggregator only has a fragmentary and shuffled view of model updates and
is oblivious to the model architecture. Our new security mechanisms can
fundamentally mitigate training reconstruction attacks, while still preserving
the final accuracy of trained models and keeping performance overheads low.</span>

recognition using speech and song channels of the RAVDESS dataset. We have
undertaken a journey to extract various audio features, identify optimal
scaling strategy and hyperparameter for our models. To increase sample size, we
have performed audio data augmentation and addressed data imbalance using
SMOTE. Our data indicate that optimised SVM outperforms MLP with an accuracy of
82 compared to 75%. Following data augmentation, the performance of both
algorithms was identical at ~79%, however, overfitting was evident for the SVM.
Our final exploration indicated that the performance of both SVM and MLP were
similar in which both resulted in lower accuracy for the speech channel
compared to the song channel. Our findings suggest that both SVM and MLP are
powerful classifiers for emotion recognition in a vocal-dependent manner.</span>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Health Outcomes Challenge seeking solutions to
predict risk in value-based care for incorporation into CMS Innovation Center
payment and service delivery models. Recently, modern language models have
played key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to
the best of our knowledge, the first application of these models to patient
readmission prediction. To facilitate this, we create a dataset of 1.2 million
medical history samples derived from the Limited Dataset (LDS) issued by CMS.
Moreover, we propose a comprehensive modeling solution centered on a deep
learning framework for this data. To demonstrate the framework, we train an
attention-based Transformer to learn Medicare semantics in support of
performing downstream prediction tasks thereby achieving 0.91 AUC and 0.91
recall on readmission classification. We also introduce a novel data

                                        <span>With the advent of big data across multiple high-impact applications, we are
often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data
usually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,
thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although
state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with
sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to
obtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these
techniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich
unlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified
heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple
types of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the
proposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual
information of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the
hidden representation of two views of the same sample. Experimental results on
real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the
proposed method modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.</span>

critical to their success in real-world applications. However, when taken to
the extreme, methods that promote robustness can hurt the model&#x27;s sensitivity
to rare or underrepresented patterns. In this paper, we discuss this trade-off
between sensitivity and robustness to natural (non-adversarial) perturbations
by introducing two notions: contextual feature utility and contextual feature
sensitivity. We propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) that encourages a
model to be more sensitive to the features that have higher contextual utility.
Empirical results demonstrate that models trained with FCL achieve a better
balance of robustness and sensitivity, leading to improved generalization in
the presence of noise on both vision and NLP datasets.</span>

predict both the presence of diabetes and the presence of undiagnosed diabetes
using eight years of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
data. Models are tuned and compared via their Brier Scores. The most relevant
variables of the best performing models are then compared. A Support Vector
Machine with a linear kernel performed best for predicting diabetes, returning
a Brier score of 0.0654 and an AUROC of 0.9235 on the test set. An elastic net
regression performed best for predicting undiagnosed diabetes with a Brier
score of 0.0294 and an AUROC of 0.9439 on the test set. Similar features appear
prominently in the models for both sets of models. Blood osmolality, family
history, the prevalance of various compounds, and hypertension are key
indicators for all diabetes risk. For undiagnosed diabetes in particular, there
are ethnicity or genetic components which arise as strong correlates as well.</span>

                                        <span>While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation
has recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,
existing approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were
gathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily
outfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the
demonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning
for vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this
work, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the
Imitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a
robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we
introduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for
Autonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies
from a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.
We evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA
not only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation
policies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a
wheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment
using a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the empirical success of neural architecture search (NAS) in deep
learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning enables multiple users to build a joint model by sharing
their model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their
devices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,
we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.
Specifically, we propose Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to
extract the labels of the users&#x27; training data from their shared gradients. The
attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the
presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of
leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well
to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and
mathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings.
Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with
high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different
defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.</span>

                                        <span>The joint task of bug localization and program repair is an integral part of
the software development process. In this work we present DeepDebug, an
approach to automated debugging using large, pretrained transformers. We begin
by training a bug-creation model on reversed commit data for the purpose of
generating synthetic bugs. We apply these synthetic bugs toward two ends.
First, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K
repositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute
tests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that
are covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information
such as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model
which was pretrained on raw source code. Finally, we strengthen all our models
by expanding the context window beyond the buggy function itself, and adding a
skeleton consisting of that function&#x27;s parent class, imports, signatures,
docstrings, and method bodies, in order of priority. On the QuixBugs benchmark,
we increase the total number of fixes found by over 50%, while also decreasing
the false positive rate from 35% to 5% and decreasing the timeout from six
hours to one minute. On our own benchmark of executable tests, our model fixes
68% of all bugs on its first attempt without using traces, and after adding
traces it fixes 75% on first attempt. We will open-source our framework and
validation set for evaluating on executable tests.</span>

                                        <span>The content based image retrieval aims to find the similar images from a
large scale dataset against a query image. Generally, the similarity between
the representative features of the query image and dataset images is used to
rank the images for retrieval. In early days, various hand designed feature
descriptors have been investigated based on the visual cues such as color,
texture, shape, etc. that represent the images. However, the deep learning has
emerged as a dominating alternative of hand-designed feature engineering from a
decade. It learns the features automatically from the data. This paper presents
a comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade
for content based image retrieval. The categorization of existing
state-of-the-art methods from different perspectives is also performed for
greater understanding of the progress. The taxonomy used in this survey covers
different supervision, different networks, different descriptor type and
different retrieval type. A performance analysis is also performed using the
state-of-the-art methods. The insights are also presented for the benefit of
the researchers to observe the progress and to make the best choices. The
survey presented in this paper will help in further research progress in image
retrieval using deep learning.</span>

                                        <span>The exponential rise of online social media has enabled the creation,
distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However,
it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing
cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of
its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like
racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a
machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the
first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online
antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting
signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling
multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any
publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect
and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and
Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that
detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism
category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of
experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.</span>
