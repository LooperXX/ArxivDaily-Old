semantic models by focusing on two specific forms of bias, namely a political
(i.e., anti-communism) and racist (i.e., antisemitism) one. For this, we use a
new corpus of German parliamentary proceedings, DeuPARL, spanning the period
1867--2020. We complement this analysis of historical biases in diachronic word
embeddings with a novel measure of bias on the basis of term co-occurrences and
graph-based label propagation. The results of our bias measurements align with
commonly perceived historical trends of antisemitic and anti-communist biases
in German politics in different time periods, thus indicating the viability of
analyzing historical bias trends using semantic spaces induced from historical
corpora.</span>

                                        <span>Question generation (QG) is a natural language generation task where a model
is trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent
approaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional
features and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase
model complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.
A single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer
learning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of
additional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,
outperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95
METEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to
their context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also
introduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not
previously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model
capacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended
in order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs
as question generators.</span>

                                        <span>We address the task of explaining relationships between two scientific
documents using natural language text. This task requires modeling the complex
content of long technical documents, deducing a relationship between these
documents, and expressing the details of that relationship in text. In addition
to the theoretical interest of this task, successful solutions can help improve
researcher efficiency in search and review. In this paper we establish a
dataset of 622K examples from 154K documents. We pretrain a large language
model to serve as the foundation for autoregressive approaches to the task. We
explore the impact of taking different views on the two documents, including
the use of dense representations extracted with scientific IE systems. We
provide extensive automatic and human evaluations which show the promise of
such models, but make clear challenges for future work.</span>

                                        <span>Most previous methods for text data augmentation are limited to simple tasks
and weak baselines. We explore data augmentation on hard tasks (i.e., few-shot
natural language understanding) and strong baselines (i.e., pretrained models
with over one billion parameters). Under this setting, we reproduced a large
number of previous augmentation methods and found that these methods bring
marginal gains at best and sometimes degrade the performance much. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation method FlipDA that jointly
uses a generative model and a classifier to generate label-flipped data.
Central to the idea of FlipDA is the discovery that generating label-flipped
data is more crucial to the performance than generating label-preserved data.
Experiments show that FlipDA achieves a good tradeoff between effectiveness and
robustness---it substantially improves many tasks while not negatively
affecting the others.</span>

performance boost on the popular Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Despite
rapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
are robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce
Adversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an
adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark,
we discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during
dataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models
successfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training
methods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard
VQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the
effectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data
augmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other
robust VQA benchmarks. We hope our Adversarial VQA dataset can shed new light
on robustness study in the community and serve as a valuable benchmark for
future work.</span>

(NLP) in recent years, proving effective even in tasks done in low-resource
languages. While pretrained transformers for these languages can be made, it is
challenging to measure their true performance and capacity due to the lack of
hard benchmark datasets, as well as the difficulty and cost of producing them.
In this paper, we present three contributions: First, we propose a methodology
for automatically producing Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark datasets
for low-resource languages using published news articles. Through this, we
create and release NewsPH-NLI, the first sentence entailment benchmark dataset
in the low-resource Filipino language. Second, we produce new pretrained
transformers based on the ELECTRA technique to further alleviate the resource
scarcity in Filipino, benchmarking them on our dataset against other
commonly-used transfer learning techniques. Lastly, we perform analyses on
transfer learning techniques to shed light on their true performance when
operating in low-data domains through the use of degradation tests.</span>

including fatigue, delirium, and headache. The long-term health impact of these
conditions is still not clear. It is necessary to develop a way to follow up
with these patients for monitoring their health status to support timely
intervention and treatment. In the lack of sufficient human resources to follow

                                        <span>Time is an important dimension in our physical world. Lots of facts can
evolve with respect to time. For example, the U.S. President might change every
four years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and
empower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA
datasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for
diagnosing or benchmarking the model&#x27;s temporal reasoning capability. In order
to promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive
QA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from
WikiData and align them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing
crowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating
question-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset
poses two novel challenges: 1) the model needs to understand both explicit and
implicit mention of time information in the long document, 2) the model needs
to perform temporal reasoning like comparison, addition, subtraction. We
evaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our
dataset. The best-performing model FiD can only achieve 46\% accuracy, still
far behind the human performance of 87\%. We demonstrate that these models are
still lacking the ability to perform robust temporal understanding and
reasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to
empower future studies in temporal reasoning. The dataset and code are released
in~\url{https://github.com/wenhuchen/Time-Sensitive-QA}.</span>

                                        <span>Creating abstractive summaries from meeting transcripts has proven to be
challenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training
neural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to
beat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we
utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract
summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a
decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a
Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary
abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of
words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a
news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting
dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting
dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,
such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI
meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.
We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2
score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also
report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for
abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring
word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous
models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,
a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these
summaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important
information from the transcripts.</span>

increases the interest in Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning
(XI-ML). This trend can be seen both in the increasing number of regulations
and strategies for developing trustworthy AI and the growing number of
scientific papers dedicated to this topic. To ensure the sustainable
development of AI, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the impact of
regulation on research papers as well as the impact of scientific discourse on
AI-related policies. This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis
of AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
research papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and
interconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology
inspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from
collected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand
interactions, similarities, and differences between documents at different
stages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics
between XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system
contributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers.</span>

model size improves performance. On the other hand, latency and connectivity
considerations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a
digital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant the ability to discuss
just about anything leads to the need for reducing the chatbot model size such
that it fits on the user&#x27;s device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can
simultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while
improving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework
that accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout
multi-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic
responses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing
transactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital
assistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4
public benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA -
Sensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish
comparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%.</span>

                                        <span>The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search
effectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical
weighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing
and retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing
literature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become
apparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a
single embedding (usually BERT&#x27;s [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE
approach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is
represented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT
approach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because
of the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear
understanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,
this paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,
noting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and
w.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than
ColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations
are statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and
MRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements
than single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well
as for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.</span>

layout, locale, and domain agnostic document extraction. In spite of the
availability of large corpora of documents, the lack of labeled and validated
datasets makes it a challenge to discriminatively train document extraction
models for enterprises. We show that this problem can be addressed by simply
transferring the information extraction (IE) task to a natural language
Question-Answering (QA) task without engineering task-specific architectures.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by evaluating on a closed corpus
of real-world retail and tax invoices with multiple complex layouts, domains,
and geographies. The empirical evaluation shows that our system outperforms 4
prominent commercial invoice solutions that use discriminatively trained models
with architectures specifically crafted for invoice extraction. We extracted 6
fields with zero upfront human annotation or training with an Avg. F1 of 87.50.</span>

                                        <span>Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is the task of extracting triplets
of aspect terms, their associated sentiments, and the opinion terms that
provide evidence for the expressed sentiments. Previous approaches to ASTE
usually simultaneously extract all three components or first identify the
aspect and opinion terms, then pair them up to predict their sentiment
polarities. In this work, we present a novel paradigm, ASTE-RL, by regarding
the aspect and opinion terms as arguments of the expressed sentiment in a
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We first focus on
sentiments expressed in a sentence, then identify the target aspect and opinion
terms for that sentiment. This takes into account the mutual interactions among
the triplet&#x27;s components while improving exploration and sample efficiency.
Furthermore, this hierarchical RLsetup enables us to deal with multiple and
overlapping triplets. In our experiments, we evaluate our model on existing
datasets from laptop and restaurant domains and show that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The implementation of this work is publicly
available at https://github.com/declare-lab/ASTE-RL.</span>

singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. In this
article, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied
in both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining
interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three
mechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying
framework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA
and LSA as special cases. In the authorship attribution example, the national
anthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is
illustrated.</span>

with model predictions. However, as of today, this comparison is mostly
lexical-based and therefore misses out on answers that have no lexical overlap
but are still semantically similar, thus treating correct answers as false.
This underestimation of the true performance of models hinders user acceptance
in applications and complicates a fair comparison of different models.
Therefore, there is a need for an evaluation metric that is based on semantics
instead of pure string similarity. In this short paper, we present SAS, a
cross-encoder-based metric for the estimation of semantic answer similarity,
and compare it to seven existing metrics. To this end, we create an English and
a German three-way annotated evaluation dataset containing pairs of answers
along with human judgment of their semantic similarity, which we release along
with an implementation of the SAS metric and the experiments. We find that
semantic similarity metrics based on recent transformer models correlate much
better with human judgment than traditional lexical similarity metrics on our
two newly created datasets and one dataset from related work.</span>

single modality such as text. However, such toxic information could also be
communicated via multimodal content such as online memes. Therefore, detecting
multimodal hateful content has recently garnered much attention in academic and
industry research communities. This paper aims to contribute to this emerging
research topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that
performed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically,
DisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to
improve hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive
experiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our
experiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform
state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme

                                        <span>Recently, dense passage retrieval has become a mainstream approach to finding
relevant information in various natural language processing tasks. A number of
studies have been devoted to improving the widely adopted dual-encoder
architecture. However, most of the previous studies only consider query-centric
similarity relation when learning the dual-encoder retriever. In order to
capture more comprehensive similarity relations, we propose a novel approach
that leverages both query-centric and PAssage-centric sImilarity Relations
(called PAIR) for dense passage retrieval. To implement our approach, we make
three major technical contributions by introducing formal formulations of the
two kinds of similarity relations, generating high-quality pseudo labeled data
via knowledge distillation, and designing an effective two-stage training
procedure that incorporates passage-centric similarity relation constraint.
Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art models on both MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Reasoning on the knowledge graph (KG) aims to infer new facts from existing
ones. Methods based on the relational path in the literature have shown strong,
interpretable, and inductive reasoning ability. However, the paths are
naturally limited in capturing complex topology in KG. In this paper, we
introduce a novel relational structure, i.e., relational directed graph
(r-digraph), which is composed of overlapped relational paths, to capture the
KG&#x27;s structural information. Since the digraph exhibits more complex structure
than paths, constructing and learning on the r-digraph are challenging. Here,
we propose a variant of graph neural network, i.e., RED-GNN, to address the
above challenges by learning the RElational Digraph with a variant of GNN.
Specifically, RED-GNN recursively encodes multiple r-digraphs with shared edges
and selects the strongly correlated edges through query-dependent attention
weights. We demonstrate the significant gains on reasoning both KG with unseen
entities and incompletion KG benchmarks by the r-digraph, the efficiency of
RED-GNN, and the interpretable dependencies learned on the r-digraph.</span>

                                        <span>With the growth of social media, the spread of hate speech is also increasing
rapidly. Social media are widely used in many countries. Also Hate Speech is
spreading in these countries. This brings a need for multilingual Hate Speech
detection algorithms. Much research in this area is dedicated to English at the
moment. The HASOC track intends to provide a platform to develop and optimize
Hate Speech detection algorithms for Hindi, German and English. The dataset is
collected from a Twitter archive and pre-classified by a machine learning
system. HASOC has two sub-task for all three languages: task A is a binary
classification problem (Hate and Not Offensive) while task B is a fine-grained
classification problem for three classes (HATE) Hate speech, OFFENSIVE and
PROFANITY. Overall, 252 runs were submitted by 40 teams. The performance of the
best classification algorithms for task A are F1 measures of 0.51, 0.53 and
0.52 for English, Hindi, and German, respectively. For task B, the best
classification algorithms achieved F1 measures of 0.26, 0.33 and 0.29 for
English, Hindi, and German, respectively. This article presents the tasks and
the data development as well as the results. The best performing algorithms
were mainly variants of the transformer architecture BERT. However, also other
systems were applied with good success</span>

to enhance the effectiveness in information retrieval. Recently, with the rapid
advance of deep learning techniques, neural text generation has achieved
promising success in many natural language tasks. To leverage the strength of
text generation for information retrieval, in this article, we propose a novel
approach which effectively integrates text generation models into PRF-based
query expansion. In particular, our approach generates augmented query terms
via neural text generation models conditioned on both the initial query and
pseudo-relevance feedback. Moreover, in order to train the generative model, we
adopt the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGANs) and propose the
PRF-CGAN method in which both the generator and the discriminator are
conditioned on the pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate the performance of
our approach on information retrieval tasks using two benchmark datasets. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance or
outperforms traditional query expansion methods on both the retrieval and
reranking tasks.</span>

                                        <span>A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of
photo-realistic face images of a person&#x27;s whole life, given only one snapshot
as reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to
be age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and
texture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because
the shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly
nonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional
transformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit
greatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly
disentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity
factors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related
transformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a
novel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics
including shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age
transformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting
shape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,
two transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other
channel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and
texture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their
rather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both
age-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS
model is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Codes and demo

spatial-temporal dependencies in computer vision tasks. Although having shown
excellent performance, they still lack the mechanism to encode the rich,
structured information among elements in an image or video. In this paper, to
theoretically analyze the property of these nonlocal-based blocks, we provide a
new perspective to interpret them, where we view them as a set of graph filters
generated on a fully-connected graph. Specifically, when choosing the Chebyshev
graph filter, a unified formulation can be derived for explaining and analyzing
the existing nonlocal-based blocks (e.g., nonlocal block, nonlocal stage,
double attention block). Furthermore, by concerning the property of spectral,
we propose an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block, which can be more
robust and flexible to catch long-range dependencies when inserted into deep
neural networks than the existing nonlocal blocks. Experimental results
demonstrate the clear-cut improvements and practical applicabilities of our
method on image classification, action recognition, semantic segmentation, and
person re-identification tasks.</span>

given rise to synthetic causal reasoning video datasets. These datasets
facilitate the development of AI algorithms that can reason about physical
interactions between objects. However, datasets thus far have primarily focused
on elementary physical events such as rolling or falling. There is currently a
scarcity of datasets that focus on the physical interactions that humans
perform daily with objects in the real world. To address this scarcity, we
introduce SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in
3D Environments. The SPACE simulator allows us to generate the SPACE dataset, a
synthetic video dataset in a 3D environment, to systematically evaluate
physics-based models on a range of physical causal reasoning tasks. Inspired by
daily object interactions, the SPACE dataset comprises videos depicting three
types of physical events: containment, stability and contact. These events make
up the vast majority of the basic physical interactions between objects. We
then further evaluate it with a state-of-the-art physics-based deep model and
show that the SPACE dataset improves the learning of intuitive physics with an
approach inspired by curriculum learning. Repository:

tremendous increase in performance, and they are now used in a broad range of
applications. Unlike classical symbolic AI systems, neural networks are trained
using large data sets and their inner structure containing possibly billions of
parameters does not lend itself to human interpretation. As a consequence, it
is so far not feasible to provide broad guarantees for the correct behaviour of
neural networks during operation if they process input data that significantly
differ from those seen during training. However, many applications of AI
systems are security- or safety-critical, and hence require obtaining
statements on the robustness of the systems when facing unexpected events,
whether they occur naturally or are induced by an attacker in a targeted way.
As a step towards developing robust AI systems for such applications, this
paper presents how the robustness of AI systems can be practically examined and
which methods and metrics can be used to do so. The robustness testing
methodology is described and analysed for the example use case of traffic sign
recognition in autonomous driving.</span>

constraints between parts to locate keypoints. Most existing CNN-based methods
do well in visual representation, however, lacking in the ability to explicitly
learn the constraint relationships between keypoints. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach based on Token representation for human Pose
estimation~(TokenPose). In detail, each keypoint is explicitly embedded as a
token to simultaneously learn constraint relationships and appearance cues from
images. Extensive experiments show that the small and large TokenPose models
are on par with state-of-the-art CNN-based counterparts while being more
lightweight. Specifically, our TokenPose-S and TokenPose-L achieve $72.5$ AP
and $75.8$ AP on COCO validation dataset respectively, with significant
reduction in parameters ($\downarrow80.6\%$; $\downarrow$ $56.8\%$) and GFLOPs

                                        <span>Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest
as it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.

Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions
(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their
recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important
challenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,
yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in
challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard
classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate
the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they
lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing
false-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the
model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while
discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a
criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier
decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses
evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform
distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the
latter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a
cross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class
prediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model
uncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced
segmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public
GlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer
show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm
the effect of our new regularizers.</span>

                                        <span>In Fluorescein Angiography (FA), an exogenous dye is injected in the
bloodstream to image the vascular structure of the retina. The injected dye can
cause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, and even
death. In contrast, color fundus imaging is a non-invasive technique used for
photographing the retina but does not have sufficient fidelity for capturing
its vascular structure. The only non-invasive method for capturing retinal
vasculature is optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). However, OCTA
equipment is quite expensive, and stable imaging is limited to small areas on
the retina. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) capable of simultaneously synthesizing FA images from
fundus photographs while predicting retinal degeneration. The proposed system
has the benefit of addressing the problem of imaging retinal vasculature in a
non-invasive manner as well as predicting the existence of retinal
abnormalities. We use a semi-supervised approach to train our GAN using
multiple weighted losses on different modalities of data. Our experiments
validate that the proposed architecture exceeds recent state-of-the-art
generative networks for fundus-to-angiography synthesis. Moreover, our vision
transformer-based discriminators generalize quite well on out-of-distribution
data sets for retinal disease prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for
large-scale pixel-wise annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL)
with a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in
adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with
image translation to well align a single domain (the source or target).
However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency
raised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper,
based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the
source and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation
and SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate
visual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and
interactive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target
domain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one
segmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as
dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to
make two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on
GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\rightarrow$Cityscapes scenarios
demonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art methods.

rapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
are robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce
Adversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an
adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark,
we discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during
dataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models
successfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training
methods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard
VQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the
effectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data
augmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other
robust VQA benchmarks. We hope our Adversarial VQA dataset can shed new light

novel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is
represented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a
corresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view
rendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is
characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D
function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a
deep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize
the 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.
Different from previous light field approaches which require dense view
sampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by
sampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,
thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training
images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while
maintaining an interactive frame rate.</span>

Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW2). Poor illumination conditions,
head/body orientation and low image resolution constitute factors that can
potentially hinder performance in case of methodologies that solely rely on the
extraction and analysis of facial features. In order to alleviate this problem,
we leverage both bodily and contextual features, as part of a broader emotion
recognition framework. We choose to use a standard CNN-RNN cascade as the
backbone of our proposed model for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning.
Apart from learning through the RGB input modality, we construct an aural
stream which operates on sequences of extracted mel-spectrograms. Our extensive
experiments on the challenging and newly assembled Aff-Wild2 dataset verify the
validity of our intuitive multi-stream and multi-modal approach towards emotion
recognition in-the-wild. Emphasis is being laid on the the beneficial influence
of the human body and scene context, as aspects of the emotion recognition
process that have been left relatively unexplored up to this point. All the

                                        <span>Monocular 3D object detection is an important task for autonomous driving
considering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than
conventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly
reflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection
offers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial
to make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we
study this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage
detector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first
transform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and
decouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to
different feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned
only according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure.
Furthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based
on the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this
framework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D
correspondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the
vision-only methods in the nuScenes 3D detection challenge of NeurIPS 2020.

cell can be obtained only using bright-field light microscopy. At
high-intensity pulsing LED illumination, we captured a primary
12-bit-per-channel (bpc) response from an observed sample using a bright-field
microscope equipped with a high-resolution (4872x3248) image sensor. In order
to suppress data distortions originating from the light interactions with
elements in the optical path, poor sensor reproduction (geometrical defects of
the camera sensor and some peculiarities of sensor sensitivity), we propose a
spectroscopic approach for the correction of this uncompressed 12-bpc data by
simultaneous calibration of all parts of the experimental arrangement.
Moreover, the final intensities of the corrected images are proportional to the
photon fluxes detected by a camera sensor. It can be visualized in 8-bpc
intensity depth after the Least Information Loss compression.</span>

                                        <span>The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing
resources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)
costs. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)
for Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI
reduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the
models with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new
model to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,
reducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and
processing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search
time was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement
compared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by
the AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early
Exit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures
with minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a
class of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest
error rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%
for CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset. Further, we implemented this
image recognition architecture for other tasks, such as object detection,
semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks, and, in our experiments,
EEEA-Net-C2 outperformed MobileNet-V3 on all of these various tasks. (The

                                        <span>With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and
their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are &quot;data hungry&quot; and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer
parameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional
embeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of
convolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as
0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%
accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant
improvement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many
modern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based
approaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing
resources and/or dealing with small datasets. Our method also works on larger
datasets, such as ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT), and
NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at

interaction. Existing multi-task affective behavior recognition methods suffer
from the problem of incomplete labeled datasets. To tackle this problem, this
paper presents a semi-supervised model with a mean teacher framework to
leverage additional unlabeled data. To be specific, a multi-task model is
proposed to learn three different kinds of facial affective representations
simultaneously. After that, the proposed model is assigned to be student and
teacher networks. When training with unlabeled data, the teacher network is
employed to predict pseudo labels for student network training, which allows it
to learn from unlabeled data. Experimental results showed that our proposed
method achieved much better performance than baseline model and ranked 4th in
both competition track 1 and track 2, and 6th in track 3, which verifies that
the proposed network can effectively learn from incomplete datasets.</span>

data using convolution-free Transformer architectures. Specifically, our
Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts
multimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of
downstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal
contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of
video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and
text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic
single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We
show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based
architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT&#x27;s vision Transformer
achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and
41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.
Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
compared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the
generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.
VATT&#x27;s audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event
recognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4% on AudioSet without any supervised
pre-training. VATT&#x27;s source code is publicly available.</span>

information such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent
point drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models
(GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM
components which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local
Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method
adaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the
point-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This
results in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point
cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve
it with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we
demonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations
and efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained
optimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid
transformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various
datasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs. Also, it is
significantly faster than modern implementations of CPD. The source code is

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.
Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent
remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.
Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the
hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target
domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source
hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade
the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,
motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are
essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are
essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in
UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other
parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,
which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose
Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by
domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the
memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the
distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and
untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate
updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image
classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar
outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments
demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA
networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift
scenarios.</span>

of clothed humans. Given a monocular RGB-D sequence, we learn a person-specific
body model which is based on a dynamic surface function network. To this end,
we explicitly model the surface of the person using a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) which is embedded into the canonical space of the SMPL body model. With
classical forward rendering, the represented surface can be rasterized using
the topology of a template mesh. For each surface point of the template mesh,
the MLP is evaluated to predict the actual surface location. To handle
pose-dependent deformations, the MLP is conditioned on the SMPL pose
parameters. We show that this surface representation as well as the pose
parameters can be learned in a self-supervised fashion using the principle of
analysis-by-synthesis and differentiable rasterization. As a result, we are
able to reconstruct a temporally coherent mesh sequence from the input data.
The underlying surface representation can be used to synthesize new animations
of the reconstructed person including pose-dependent deformations.</span>

recycling management industries. The need for smart systems for environmental
monitoring and the enhancement of recycling processes is thus greater than
ever. Amongst these efforts lies IBM&#x27;s Wastenet project which aims to improve
recycling by using artificial intelligence for waste classification. The work
reported in this paper builds on this project through the use of transfer
learning and data augmentation techniques to ameliorate classification
accuracy. Starting with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a systematic
approach is followed for selecting appropriate splitting ratios and for tuning
multiple training parameters including learning rate schedulers, layers
freezing, batch sizes and loss functions, in the context of the given scenario
which requires classification of waste into different recycling types. Results
are compared and contrasted using 10-fold cross validation and demonstrate that
the model developed achieves a 91.21% test accuracy. Subsequently, a range of
data augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including
flipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show
that these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the
final model to 95.40%. Unlike other work reported in the field, this paper
provides full details regarding the training of the model. Furthermore, the
code for this work has been made open-source and we have demonstrated that the
model can perform successful real-time classification of recycling waste items
using a standard computer webcam.</span>

critical importance for the development of the related solutions.
Unfortunately, the lack of ground-truths to be used as guidance for an
objective evaluation has pushed the community to resort to either
reference-based reduced-resolution indexes or to no-reference subjective
quality indexes that can be applied on full-resolution datasets. In particular,
the reference-based approach leverages on Wald&#x27;s protocol, a resolution
degradation process that allows one to synthesize data with related ground
truth. Both solutions, however, present critical shortcomings that we aim to
mitigate in this work by means of an alternative no-reference full-resolution
framework. On one side we introduce a protocol, namely the reprojection
protocol, which allows to handle the spectral fidelity problem. On the other
side, a new index of the spatial consistency between the pansharpened image and
the panchromatic band at full resolution is proposed. The experimental results
show the effectiveness of the proposed approach which is confirmed also by
visual inspection.</span>

                                        <span>Geometry Projection is a powerful depth estimation method in monocular 3D
object detection. It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces
mathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces
the error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height
will be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property
leads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network
(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and
training stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the
geometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high
reliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.
Furthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning
strategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning
algorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator
and adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to
their pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when
its pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability
and efficiency of the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The overall model can infer more reliable
object depth than existing methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art
image-based monocular 3D detectors by 3.74% and 4.7% AP40 of the car and
pedestrian categories on the KITTI benchmark.</span>

recognition accuracy on scene text recognition, how to handle low-quality text
images in end-to-end deep networks remains a research challenge. In this paper,
we propose an Iterative Fusion based Recognizer (IFR) for low quality scene

feature representation. IFR contains two branches which focus on scene text
recognition and low quality scene text image recovery respectively. We utilize
an iterative collaboration between two branches, which can effectively
alleviate the impact of low quality input. A feature fusion module is proposed
to strengthen the feature representation of the two branches, where the
features from the Recognizer are Fused with image Restoration branch, referred
to as RRF. Without changing the recognition network structure, extensive
quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms the baseline methods in boosting the recognition
accuracy of benchmark datasets and low resolution images in TextZoom dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Algorithmic decision support is rapidly becoming a staple of personalized
medicine, especially for high-stakes recommendations in which access to certain
information can drastically alter the course of treatment, and thus, patient
outcome; a prominent example is radiomics for cancer subtyping. Because in
these scenarios the stakes are high, it is desirable for decision systems to
not only provide recommendations but supply transparent reasoning in support
thereof. For learning-based systems, this can be achieved through an
interpretable design of the inference pipeline. Herein we describe an automated
yet interpretable system for uveal melanoma subtyping with digital cytology
images from fine needle aspiration biopsies. Our method embeds every
automatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D
manifold defined by many representative slides, which enables reasoning about
the cell-level composition of the tissue sample, paving the way for
interpretable subtyping of the biopsy. Finally, a rule-based slide-level
classification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly
distorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is
evaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our
in house cytology dataset of 88 uveal melanoma patients, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 87.5% that compares favorably to all competing
approaches, including deep &quot;black box&quot; models. The method comes with a user
interface to facilitate interaction with cell-level content, which may offer
additional insights for pathological assessment.</span>

                                        <span>The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and
decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In
this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and
present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our
approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the
content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,
which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the
training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional
spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head
cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,
each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct
region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This
narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object
classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content
embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional
DETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for
stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101. Code is available at
https://git.io/ConditionalDETR.</span>

                                        <span>Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing
learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated
medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust
medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised
approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,
and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to
previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream
tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have become a
popular strategy for processing point cloud data, regularly achieving
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. To date, the research
community has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, with
secondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on
resource constrained mobile devices including smartphones or mixed reality
headsets. In this work we make a step towards improving the efficiency of these
models by making the observation that these GNN models are heavily limited by
the representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find
that it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature
extraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance;
further, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on
ModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our
approach reduces memory consumption by 20$\times$ and latency by up to
9.9$\times$ for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve
speed-ups of up to 4.5$\times$ and peak memory reductions of 72.5%.</span>

slides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain is used in the
diagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,
in many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional &quot;special
stains&quot; are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue
components and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this
study, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational
stain transformation from H&amp;E to different special stains (Masson&#x27;s Trichrome,
periodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney
needle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed
by adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of
virtual special stains from existing H&amp;E images improves the diagnosis in
several non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A
second study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the
special stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically
equivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the
transformation of H&amp;E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min
or less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation
framework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional
special stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,
reducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning and convolutional neural networks allow achieving impressive
performance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of
such models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario
instead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to
real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,
billboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire
perception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the
robustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and
real-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks
enriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the
Cityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over
Transformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack
optimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack
leverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the
proposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical
billboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving
scenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.
Exhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations
outperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial
patches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these
attacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the
practical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted
driving.</span>

                                        <span>Occlusion relationship reasoning based on convolution neural networks
consists of two subtasks: occlusion boundary extraction and occlusion
orientation inference. Due to the essential differences between the two
subtasks in the feature expression at the higher and lower stages, it is
challenging to carry on them simultaneously in one network. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Dual-path Decoder Network, which uniformly extracts
occlusion information at higher stages and separates into two paths to recover
boundary and occlusion orientation respectively in lower stages. Besides,
considering the restriction of occlusion orientation presentation to occlusion
orientation learning, we design a new orthogonal representation for occlusion
orientation and proposed the Orthogonal Orientation Regression loss which can
get rid of the unfitness between occlusion representation and learning and
further prompt the occlusion orientation learning. Finally, we apply a
multi-scale loss together with our proposed orientation regression loss to
guide the boundary and orientation path learning respectively. Experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on PIOD
and BSDS ownership datasets.</span>

step-by-step while perceiving the visual observations and comprehending a
natural language instruction. Large data bias, which is caused by the disparity
ratio between the small data scale and large navigation space, makes the VLN
task challenging. Previous works have proposed various data augmentation
methods to reduce data bias. However, these works do not explicitly reduce the
data bias across different house scenes. Therefore, the agent would overfit to
the seen scenes and achieve poor navigation performance in the unseen scenes.
To tackle this problem, we propose the Random Environmental Mixup (REM) method,
which generates cross-connected house scenes as augmented data via mixuping
environment. Specifically, we first select key viewpoints according to the room
connection graph for each scene. Then, we cross-connect the key views of
different scenes to construct augmented scenes. Finally, we generate augmented
instruction-path pairs in the cross-connected scenes. The experimental results
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our augmentation data via REM help the
agent reduce its performance gap between the seen and unseen environment and
improve the overall performance, making our model the best existing approach on
the standard VLN benchmark.</span>

behaviour in order to navigate safely. We present FIERY: a probabilistic future
prediction model in bird&#x27;s-eye view from monocular cameras. Our model predicts
future instance segmentation and motion of dynamic agents that can be
transformed into non-parametric future trajectories. Our approach combines the
perception, sensor fusion and prediction components of a traditional autonomous
driving stack by estimating bird&#x27;s-eye-view prediction directly from surround
RGB monocular camera inputs. FIERY learns to model the inherent stochastic
nature of the future solely from camera driving data in an end-to-end manner,
without relying on HD maps, and predicts multimodal future trajectories. We
show that our model outperforms previous prediction baselines on the NuScenes

                                        <span>The random walker method for image segmentation is a popular tool for
semi-automatic image segmentation, especially in the biomedical field. However,
its linear asymptotic run time and memory requirements make application to 3D
datasets of increasing sizes impractical. We propose a hierarchical framework
that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to overcome these
restrictions for the random walker algorithm and achieves sublinear run time
and constant memory complexity. The goal of this framework is -- rather than
improving the segmentation quality compared to the baseline method -- to make
interactive segmentation on out-of-core datasets possible. The method is
evaluated quantitavely on synthetic data and the CT-ORG dataset where the
expected improvements in algorithm run time while maintaining high segmentation
quality are confirmed. The incremental (i.e., interaction update) run time is
demonstrated to be in seconds on a standard PC even for volumes of hundreds of
Gigabytes in size. In a small case study the applicability to large real world
from current biomedical research is demonstrated. An implementation of the
presented method is publicly available in version 5.2 of the widely used volume
rendering and processing software Voreen (https://www.uni-muenster.de/Voreen/).</span>

                                        <span>Existing GAN inversion methods are stuck in a paradox that the inverted codes
can either achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, or retain the editing
capability. Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing.
In this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (\eg,
video frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion
process. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of
consecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property
is used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,
such that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the
other and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,
such that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the
complement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
alternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
reconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and
synthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of
video-based GAN inversion, and an interesting application of unsupervised
semantic transfer from consecutive images. Source code can be found at:

                                        <span>Autonomous parking systems start with the detection of available parking
slots. Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by
deep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be
categorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known
that the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general
object detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so
far. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been
adequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a
highly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific
multi-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds
the entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,
length, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific
regions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from
them. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately
extracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and
orientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are
utilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A
high-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location
and orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract
semantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method
was quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection
datasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and
two-stage approaches.</span>

understanding and improving visual experience. The current state-of-the-art IQA
methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of
CNN-based models is often compromised by the fixed shape constraint in batch
training. To accommodate this, the input images are usually resized and cropped
to a fixed shape, causing image quality degradation. To address this, we design
a multi-scale image quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to process native resolution
images with varying sizes and aspect ratios. With a multi-scale image
representation, our proposed method can capture image quality at different
granularities. Furthermore, a novel hash-based 2D spatial embedding and a scale
embedding is proposed to support the positional embedding in the multi-scale
representation. Experimental results verify that our method can achieve
state-of-the-art performance on multiple large scale IQA datasets such as
PaQ-2-PiQ, SPAQ and KonIQ-10k.</span>

approach consists of classifying groups of terrains based on their navigability

transformer-based deep neural network architecture that uses a novel group-wise
attention mechanism to distinguish between navigability levels of different
terrains. Our group-wise attention heads enable the network to explicitly focus

evaluations on the RUGD and RELLIS-3D datasets that our learning algorithm
improves visual perception accuracy in off-road terrains for navigation. We
compare our approach with prior work on these datasets and achieve an
improvement over the state-of-the-art mIoU by 6.74-39.1% on RUGD and
3.82-10.64% on RELLIS-3D. In addition, we deploy our method on a Clearpath

most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no
specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it
largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we
investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of
people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as
human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we
do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group
activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,
first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine
a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation
can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very
diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we
provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and
group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also
put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible
concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on
methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation
approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and
limitations in current literature along with possible future research
directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing
methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and
provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Learning has celebrated resounding successes in many application areas
of relevance to the Internet-of-Things, for example, computer vision and
machine listening. To fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT,
these technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge. The obvious
challenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly
resource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This
task relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,
quantization and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This paper examines the
suitability of these techniques for audio classification in microcontrollers.
We present an XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a
comprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with
pruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with
XNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small
numbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation
requirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases
significantly, performance degrades and pruning-and-quantization based
compression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to
satisfy the same space constraints but requiring about 8x more computation. We
show that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and
image classification using standard benchmark sets.To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study applying XNOR to end-to-end audio
classification and evaluating it in the context of alternative techniques. All
code is publicly available on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>Transfer learning from supervised ImageNet models has been frequently used in
medical image analysis. Yet, no large-scale evaluation has been conducted to
benchmark the efficacy of newly-developed pre-training techniques for medical
image analysis, leaving several important questions unanswered. As the first
step in this direction, we conduct a systematic study on the transferability of
models pre-trained on iNat2021, the most recent large-scale fine-grained
dataset, and 14 top self-supervised ImageNet models on 7 diverse medical tasks
in comparison with the supervised ImageNet model. Furthermore, we present a
practical approach to bridge the domain gap between natural and medical images
by continually (pre-)training supervised ImageNet models on medical images. Our
comprehensive evaluation yields new insights: (1) pre-trained models on
fine-grained data yield distinctive local representations that are more
suitable for medical segmentation tasks, (2) self-supervised ImageNet models
learn holistic features more effectively than supervised ImageNet models, and
(3) continual pre-training can bridge the domain gap between natural and
medical images. We hope that this large-scale open evaluation of transfer
learning can direct the future research of deep learning for medical imaging.

                                        <span>In the fields of image restoration and image fusion, model-driven methods and
data-driven methods are the two representative frameworks. However, both
approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The model-driven
methods consider the imaging mechanism, which is deterministic and
theoretically reasonable; however, they cannot easily model complicated
nonlinear problems. The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge
learning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical
features; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are
over-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate
the coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been
considered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities. We
are the first to summarize the coupling approaches into the following three
categories: 1) data-driven and model-driven cascading methods; 2) variational
models with embedded learning; and 3) model-constrained network learning
methods. The typical existing and potential coupling methods for remote sensing
image restoration and fusion are introduced with application examples. This
paper also gives some new insights into the potential future directions, in
terms of both methods and applications.</span>

federated learning (FL), we propose a communication-efficient
re-parameterization, FedPara. Our method re-parameterizes the model&#x27;s layers
using low-rank matrices or tensors followed by the Hadamard product. Different
from the conventional low-rank parameterization, our method is not limited to
low-rank constraints. Thereby, our FedPara has a larger capacity than the
low-rank one, even with the same number of parameters. It can achieve
comparable performance to the original models while requiring 2.8 to 10.1 times
lower communication costs than the original models, which is not achievable by
the traditional low-rank parameterization. Moreover, the efficiency can be
further improved by combining our method and other efficient FL techniques
because our method is compatible with others. We also extend our method to a
personalized FL application, pFedPara, which separates parameters into global
and local ones. We show that pFedPara outperforms competing personalized FL
methods with more than three times fewer parameters.</span>

success in various fields. However, many existing methods, especially low-cost
ones, are difficult to achieve real-time and long-term object detection and
tracking. Here, a non-imaging strategy is proposed, including two stages, to
realize fast-moving object detection and tracking in real-time and for the long
term: 1) a contour-moments-based method is proposed to optimize the Hadamard
pattern sequence. And then reconstructing projection curves of the object based
on single-pixel imaging technology. The projection curve, which including the
object location information, is reconstructed directly with the measurements
collected by a single-pixel detector; 2) The fastest changing position in the
projection curve can be obtained by solving first-order gradients. A gradient
differential is used in two first-order gradients to calculate a differential
curve with the sudden change positions. Finally, we can obtain the boundary
information of the fast-moving object. We experimentally demonstrate that our
approach can achieve a temporal resolution of 105 frames per second at a 1.28%
sampling rate by using a 22,000 Hz digital micro-mirror device. The detection
and tracking algorithm of the proposed strategy is computationally efficient.
Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can make the sampling
rate lower. Additionally, the strategy acquires not more than 1MB of data for
each frame, which is capable of fast-moving object real-time and long-term
detection and tracking.</span>

                                        <span>Due to the sparsity and irregularity of the 3D data, approaches that directly
process points have become popular. Among all point-based models,
Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance by fully
preserving point interrelation. However, most of them spend high percentage of
total time on sparse data accessing (e.g., Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and
neighbor points query), which becomes the computation burden. Therefore, we
present a novel 3D Transformer, called Point-Voxel Transformer (PVT) that
leverages self-attention computation in points to gather global context
features, while performing multi-head self-attention (MSA) computation in
voxels to capture local information and reduce the irregular data access.
Additionally, to further reduce the cost of MSA computation, we design a cyclic
shifted boxing scheme which brings greater efficiency by limiting the MSA
computation to non-overlapping local boxes while also preserving cross-box
connection. Our method fully exploits the potentials of Transformer
architecture, paving the road to efficient and accurate recognition results.
Evaluated on classification and segmentation benchmarks, our PVT not only
achieves strong accuracy but outperforms previous state-of-the-art
Transformer-based models with 9x measured speedup on average. For 3D object
detection task, we replace the primitives in Frustrum PointNet with PVT layer
and achieve the improvement of 8.6%.</span>

recent years, to leverage a huge amount of unlabeled data to improve the
performance of deep learning with limited labeled data. Pseudo-labeling is a
popular approach to expand the labeled dataset. However, whether there is a
more effective way of labeling remains an open problem. In this paper, we
propose to label only the most representative samples to expand the labeled
set. Representative samples, selected by indegree of corresponding nodes on a
directed k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph, lie in the k-nearest neighborhood of
many other samples. We design a graph neural network (GNN) labeler to label
them in a progressive learning manner. Aided by the progressive GNN labeler,
our deep SSL approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several popular
SSL benchmarks including CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ILSVRC-2012. Notably, we achieve

                                        <span>While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks,
they are fragile to carefully designed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel
adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and
Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained
from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher
model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial
examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model
is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate
features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover,
to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a
bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first
attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in
the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the
original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten
the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge
that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial
robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our
proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches. The code of AGKD-BML will be available at:

                                        <span>Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the change detection (CD) task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed semantic categories
(before and after the observation intervals). This fine-grained change
information is more useful in land-cover/land-use (LC/LU) applications. Recent
studies indicate that the SCD can be modeled through a triple-branch
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which contains two temporal branches and a
change branch. However, in this architecture, the connections between the
temporal branches and the change branch are weak. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel CNN architecture for the SCD, where the
temporal features are re-used and are deeply merged in the temporal branch.
Furthermore, we elaborate on this architecture to model the bi-temporal
semantic correlations. The resulting Bi-temporal Semantic Reasoning Network
(Bi-SRNet) contains two types of semantic reasoning blocks to reason both
single-temporal and cross-temporal semantic correlations, as well as a novel
loss function to improve the semantic consistency of change detection results.
Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed architecture
obtains significant accuracy improvements over the existing approaches, while
the added designs in the Bi-SRNet further improves the segmentation of both
semantic categories and the changed areas. The codes in this paper are

                                        <span>Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building
autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

                                        <span>The multi-modal salient object detection model based on RGB-D information has
better robustness in the real world. However, it remains nontrivial to better
adaptively balance effective multi-modal information in the feature fusion
phase. In this letter, we propose a novel gated recoding network (GRNet) to
evaluate the information validity of the two modes, and balance their
influence. Our framework is divided into three phases: perception phase,
recoding mixing phase and feature integration phase. First, A perception
encoder is adopted to extract multi-level single-modal features, which lays the
foundation for multi-modal semantic comparative analysis. Then, a
modal-adaptive gate unit (MGU) is proposed to suppress the invalid information
and transfer the effective modal features to the recoding mixer and the hybrid
branch decoder. The recoding mixer is responsible for recoding and mixing the
balanced multi-modal information. Finally, the hybrid branch decoder completes
the multi-level feature integration under the guidance of an optional edge
guidance stream (OEGS). Experiments and analysis on eight popular benchmarks
verify that our framework performs favorably against 9 state-of-art methods.</span>

jointly define a class-to-class similarity based class representation and a

separately handling the visual and non-visual components of the captions. Our

                                        <span>Vehicle tracking is an essential task in the multi-object tracking (MOT)
field. A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories
of vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image
coordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high
necessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite
challenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,
detection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist
object re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,
doing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive
to occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of
motion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose
a novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with
the exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet
embedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep
graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the
KITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method,
though without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance
with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers. The source code will be available at

issue for deep neural networks. The key to resolve the OOD overconfidence issue
inherently is to build a subset of OOD samples and then suppress predictions on
them. This paper proposes the Chamfer OOD examples (CODEs), whose distribution
is close to that of in-distribution samples, and thus could be utilized to
alleviate the OOD overconfidence issue effectively by suppressing predictions
on them. To obtain CODEs, we first generate seed OOD examples via
slicing&amp;splicing operations on in-distribution samples from different
categories, and then feed them to the Chamfer generative adversarial network
for distribution transformation, without accessing to any extra data. Training
with suppressing predictions on CODEs is validated to alleviate the OOD
overconfidence issue largely without hurting classification accuracy, and
outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we demonstrate CODEs are

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is
mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn
domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in
applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in
adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.
To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the
transferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,
ViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with
a large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating
adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation
strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT&#x27;s intrinsic merits (e.g.,
attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an
important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified
framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the
transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately
devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption
Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM
compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we
leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation
which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its
versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the
experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements
compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.</span>

                                        <span>Image matting and image harmonization are two important tasks in image
composition. Image matting, aiming to achieve foreground boundary details, and
image harmonization, aiming to make the background compatible with the
foreground, are both promising yet challenging tasks. Previous works consider
optimizing these two tasks separately, which may lead to a sub-optimal
solution. We propose to optimize matting and harmonization simultaneously to
get better performance on both the two tasks and achieve more natural results.
We propose a new Generative Adversarial (GAN) framework which optimizing the
matting network and the harmonization network based on a self-attention
discriminator. The discriminator is required to distinguish the natural images
from different types of fake synthesis images. Extensive experiments on our
constructed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our

signature verification where researchers can easily benchmark their systems
against the state of the art in an open common platform using large-scale
public databases, such as DeepSignDB and SVC2021_EvalDB, and standard
experimental protocols. SVC-onGoing is based on the ICDAR 2021 Competition on
On-Line Signature Verification (SVC 2021), which has been extended to allow
participants anytime. The goal of SVC-onGoing is to evaluate the limits of
on-line signature verification systems on popular scenarios (office/mobile) and
writing inputs (stylus/finger) through large-scale public databases. Three
different tasks are considered in the competition, simulating realistic
scenarios as both random and skilled forgeries are simultaneously considered on
each task. The results obtained in SVC-onGoing prove the high potential of deep
learning methods in comparison with traditional methods. In particular, the
best signature verification system has obtained Equal Error Rate (EER) values
of 3.33% (Task 1), 7.41% (Task 2), and 6.04% (Task 3). Future studies in the
field should be oriented to improve the performance of signature verification
systems on the challenging mobile scenarios of SVC-onGoing in which several
mobile devices and the finger are used during the signature acquisition.</span>

Disease diagnosis use different biomarker combinations to classify patients,
but do not allow extracting knowledge about the interactions of biomarkers.
However, to improve our understanding of the disease, it is paramount to
extract such knowledge from the learned model. In this paper, we propose a Deep
Factorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex
relationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed
model has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical
data, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,
and (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our
experiments on data from the Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we
demonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive
impaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In
addition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among
biomarkers can be obtained.</span>

emphasize the natural effect of photorealistic image stylization. In general,
distortion of the image content and lacking of details are two typical issues
in the style transfer field. To this end, we design a novel framework employing
the U-Net structure to maintain the rich spatial clues, with a multi-layer
feature aggregation (MFA) method to simultaneously provide the details obtained
by the shallow layers in the stylization processing. In particular, an encoder
based on the dense block and a decoder form a symmetrical structure of U-Net
are jointly staked to realize an effective feature extraction and image
reconstruction. Besides, a transfer module based on MFA and &quot;adaptive instance
normalization&quot; (AdaIN) is inserted in the skip connection positions to achieve
the stylization. Accordingly, the stylized image possesses the texture of a
real photo and preserves rich content details without introducing any mask or
post-processing steps. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a more faithful structural similarity with a lower
style loss, reflecting the effectiveness and merit of our approach.</span>

                                        <span>Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the
fast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,
Microsoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to
wake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm
manually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,
such as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a
system that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder
list. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named
entity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the
web is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative
sentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object
extraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of
interest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading
Comprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by
formulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended
to the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by
our proposed model for tracking objects kept during the &quot;packing activity.&quot;
Eventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent
containing the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance
compared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, dense passage retrieval has become a mainstream approach to finding
relevant information in various natural language processing tasks. A number of
studies have been devoted to improving the widely adopted dual-encoder
architecture. However, most of the previous studies only consider query-centric
similarity relation when learning the dual-encoder retriever. In order to
capture more comprehensive similarity relations, we propose a novel approach
that leverages both query-centric and PAssage-centric sImilarity Relations
(called PAIR) for dense passage retrieval. To implement our approach, we make
three major technical contributions by introducing formal formulations of the
two kinds of similarity relations, generating high-quality pseudo labeled data
via knowledge distillation, and designing an effective two-stage training
procedure that incorporates passage-centric similarity relation constraint.
Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art models on both MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets.</span>

have been proposed in the past, however, existing systems are not yet capable
of reliably predicting ratings with the same accuracy as professional judges.
This study investigates contrastive learning as a potential method to improve
existing MPA systems. Contrastive learning is a widely used technique in
representation learning to learn a structured latent space capable of
separately clustering multiple classes. It has been shown to produce state of
the art results for image-based classification problems. We introduce a
weighted contrastive loss suitable for regression tasks applied to a
convolutional neural network and show that contrastive loss results in
performance gains in regression tasks for MPA. Our results show that
contrastive-based methods are able to match and exceed SoTA performance for MPA
regression tasks by creating better class clusters within the latent space of
the neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender
systems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix
factorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After
recent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show
state-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based
on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN
concept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method
of Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty
in our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,
i) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed
ones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,
and iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set
of neural network connections. We also present a novel training method
specialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,
Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better
accuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442
by LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in
Amazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth
mentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather
than linear connections.</span>

                                        <span>The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search
effectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical
weighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing
and retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing
literature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become
apparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a
single embedding (usually BERT&#x27;s [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE
approach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is
represented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT
approach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because
of the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear
understanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,
this paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,
noting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and
w.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than
ColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations
are statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and
MRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements
than single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well
as for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.</span>

as numerical ratings, textual reviews and images. These information can be
utilized to assist recommendation. Through textual reviews, a user explicitly
express her affinity towards the item. Previous researchers found that by using
the information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users&#x27;
explicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement
of recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were
only utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating
prediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as
top-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully
explored. Seeing this gap, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
textual review information for top-N recommendation under E-commerce settings.
We adapt several SOTA review-based rating prediction models for top-N
recommendation tasks and compare them to existing top-N recommendation models
from both performance and efficiency. We find that models utilizing only review
information can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback
matrix factorization method. When utilizing review information as a regularizer
or auxiliary information, the performance of implicit-feedback matrix
factorization method can be further improved. However, the optimal model
structure to utilize textual reviews for E-commerce top-N recommendation is yet
to be determined.</span>

recommending products by combining several techniques and algorithms to form a
pool that would bring forward the most enhanced models for making the
predictions. Building on these lines is our paper focused on the application of
sentiment analysis for recommendation in the insurance domain. We tried
building the following Machine Learning models namely, Logistic Regression,
Multinomial Naive Bayes, and the mighty Random Forest for analyzing the
polarity of a given feedback line given by a customer. Then we used this
polarity along with other attributes like Age, Gender, Locality, Income, and
the list of other products already purchased by our existing customers as input
for our recommendation model. Then we matched the polarity score along with the
user&#x27;s profiles and generated the list of insurance products to be recommended
in descending order. Despite our model&#x27;s simplicity and the lack of the key
data sets, the results seemed very logical and realistic. So, by developing the
model with more enhanced methods and with access to better and true data
gathered from an insurance industry may be the sector could be very well
benefitted from the amalgamation of sentiment analysis with a recommendation.</span>

increases the interest in Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning
(XI-ML). This trend can be seen both in the increasing number of regulations
and strategies for developing trustworthy AI and the growing number of
scientific papers dedicated to this topic. To ensure the sustainable
development of AI, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the impact of
regulation on research papers as well as the impact of scientific discourse on
AI-related policies. This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis
of AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
research papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and
interconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology
inspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from
collected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand
interactions, similarities, and differences between documents at different
stages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics
between XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system
contributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers.</span>

                                        <span>Latent factor models play a dominant role among recommendation techniques.
However, most of the existing latent factor models assume both historical
interactions and embedding dimensions are independent of each other, and thus
regrettably ignore the high-order interaction information among historical
interactions and embedding dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel latent
factor model called COMET (COnvolutional diMEnsion inTeraction), which
simultaneously model the high-order interaction patterns among historical
interactions and embedding dimensions. To be specific, COMET stacks the
embeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in
two &quot;embedding maps&quot;. In this way, internal interactions and dimensional
interactions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks with kernels of
different sizes simultaneously. A fully-connected multi-layer perceptron is
then applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of
users and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can
further be used to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies on various public implicit feedback datasets clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness and the rationality of our proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Hateful and offensive content detection has been extensively explored in a
single modality such as text. However, such toxic information could also be
communicated via multimodal content such as online memes. Therefore, detecting
multimodal hateful content has recently garnered much attention in academic and
industry research communities. This paper aims to contribute to this emerging
research topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that
performed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically,
DisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to
improve hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive
experiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our
experiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform
state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme
classification task. Empirical case studies were also conducted to demonstrate
DisMultiHate&#x27;s ability to disentangle target entities in memes and ultimately
showcase DisMultiHate&#x27;s explainability of the multimodal hateful content
classification task.</span>

                                        <span>Both latent semantic analysis (LSA) and correspondence analysis (CA) use a
singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. In this
article, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied
in both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining
interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three
mechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying
framework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA
and LSA as special cases. In the authorship attribution example, the national
anthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is
illustrated.</span>

with model predictions. However, as of today, this comparison is mostly
lexical-based and therefore misses out on answers that have no lexical overlap
but are still semantically similar, thus treating correct answers as false.
This underestimation of the true performance of models hinders user acceptance
in applications and complicates a fair comparison of different models.
Therefore, there is a need for an evaluation metric that is based on semantics
instead of pure string similarity. In this short paper, we present SAS, a
cross-encoder-based metric for the estimation of semantic answer similarity,
and compare it to seven existing metrics. To this end, we create an English and
a German three-way annotated evaluation dataset containing pairs of answers
along with human judgment of their semantic similarity, which we release along
with an implementation of the SAS metric and the experiments. We find that
semantic similarity metrics based on recent transformer models correlate much
better with human judgment than traditional lexical similarity metrics on our
two newly created datasets and one dataset from related work.</span>

to enhance the effectiveness in information retrieval. Recently, with the rapid
advance of deep learning techniques, neural text generation has achieved
promising success in many natural language tasks. To leverage the strength of
text generation for information retrieval, in this article, we propose a novel
approach which effectively integrates text generation models into PRF-based
query expansion. In particular, our approach generates augmented query terms
via neural text generation models conditioned on both the initial query and
pseudo-relevance feedback. Moreover, in order to train the generative model, we
adopt the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGANs) and propose the
PRF-CGAN method in which both the generator and the discriminator are
conditioned on the pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate the performance of
our approach on information retrieval tasks using two benchmark datasets. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance or
outperforms traditional query expansion methods on both the retrieval and
reranking tasks.</span>

associated with a seizure from normal neural activity in a variety of
conditions. Our approach is to seek spatiotemporal waveforms with distinct
morphology in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings of epileptic patients
that are indicative of a subsequent seizure (preictal) versus non-seizure
segments (interictal). To find these waveforms we apply a shift-invariant
k-means algorithm to segments of spatially filtered signals to learn codebooks
of prototypical waveforms. The frequency of the cluster labels from the
codebooks is then used to train a binary classifier that predicts the class
(preictal or interictal) of a test ECoG segment. We use the Matthews
correlation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the classifier and the
quality of the codebooks. We found that our method finds recurrent
non-sinusoidal waveforms that could be used to build interpretable features for
seizure prediction and that are also physiologically meaningful.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have become a
popular strategy for processing point cloud data, regularly achieving
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. To date, the research
community has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, with
secondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on
resource constrained mobile devices including smartphones or mixed reality
headsets. In this work we make a step towards improving the efficiency of these
models by making the observation that these GNN models are heavily limited by
the representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find
that it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature
extraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance;
further, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on
ModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our
approach reduces memory consumption by 20$\times$ and latency by up to
9.9$\times$ for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve
speed-ups of up to 4.5$\times$ and peak memory reductions of 72.5%.</span>

                                        <span>In the last years, AI systems, in particular neural networks, have seen a
tremendous increase in performance, and they are now used in a broad range of
applications. Unlike classical symbolic AI systems, neural networks are trained
using large data sets and their inner structure containing possibly billions of
parameters does not lend itself to human interpretation. As a consequence, it
is so far not feasible to provide broad guarantees for the correct behaviour of
neural networks during operation if they process input data that significantly
differ from those seen during training. However, many applications of AI
systems are security- or safety-critical, and hence require obtaining
statements on the robustness of the systems when facing unexpected events,
whether they occur naturally or are induced by an attacker in a targeted way.
As a step towards developing robust AI systems for such applications, this
paper presents how the robustness of AI systems can be practically examined and
which methods and metrics can be used to do so. The robustness testing
methodology is described and analysed for the example use case of traffic sign
recognition in autonomous driving.</span>

allow for better designs through low-cost iterations. While CAD programs are
typically taught to undergraduate students as a job skill, such software can
also help students learn engineering concepts. A current limitation of CAD
programs (even those that are specifically designed for educational purposes)
is that they are not capable of providing automated real-time help to students.
To encourage CAD programs to build in assistance to students, we used data
generated from students using a free, open source CAD software called Aladdin
to demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can
predict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We
challenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of
an introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from
128 students, along with the scikit-learn Python machine learning library, we
tested our models using both total counts of design actions and sequences of
design actions as inputs. We found that our models using early design sequence
actions are particularly valuable for prediction. Our logistic regression model
achieved a &gt;60% chance of predicting if a student would succeed in designing a
zero net energy house. Our results suggest that it would be feasible for
Aladdin to provide useful feedback to students when they are approximately
halfway through their design. Further improvements to these models could lead
to earlier predictions and thus provide students feedback sooner to enhance
their learning.</span>

                                        <span>Accumulated clinical studies show that microbes living in humans interact
closely with human hosts, and get involved in modulating drug efficacy and drug
toxicity. Microbes have become novel targets for the development of
antibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can
benefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial
genomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an
effective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In
this paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug
associations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed
multi-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs,
such as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function
annotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained
to learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node
and the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to
predict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model
ablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We
evaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results
showed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art
methods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations
of drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are
significantly consistent with drug ATC classification. Moreover, we conducted
case studies on two microbes and two drugs and found 75\%-95\% predicted
associations have been reported in PubMed literature. Our extensive performance
evaluations validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.\</span>

unfolded as neural networks. Empirically, this approach has often led to
improved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some
progress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great
challenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to
present a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable
for sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class
considered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm
(ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations
of ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at
learning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and
thereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive
linear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is
shared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for
dictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization
bound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis
classes consisting of such deep networks via Dudley&#x27;s integral. Remarkably,
under realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only
logarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of
measurements.</span>

years, becoming the state of the art in a variety of domains. In particular,
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been employed to train DNNs that
realize control policies for various types of real-world systems. In this work,
we present the whiRL 2.0 tool, which implements a new approach for verifying
complex properties of interest for DRL systems. To demonstrate the benefits of
whiRL 2.0, we apply it to case studies from the communication networks domain
that have recently been used to motivate formal verification of DRL systems,
and which exhibit characteristics that are conducive for scalable verification.
We propose techniques for performing k-induction and semi-automated invariant
inference on such systems, and leverage these techniques for proving safety and
liveness properties that were previously impossible to verify due to the
scalability barriers of prior approaches. Furthermore, we show how our proposed
techniques provide insights into the inner workings and the generalizability of
DRL systems. whiRL 2.0 is publicly available online.</span>

                                        <span>Radiomics is an active area of research in medical image analysis, the low
reproducibility of radiomics has limited its applicability to clinical
practice. This issue is especially prominent when radiomic features are
calculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans.
In this article, we investigate the possibility of improving the
reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs by using
generative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method - non-local
means - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test
models. We added noise to the sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs
with two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and high-noise CT. Models were
trained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without
re-training. We also test the performance of our model in real data, using
dataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs to assess the reproducibility of
radiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved the
concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise
images from 0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92
respectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN improved the test-retest
reliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94) based
on real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can
improve the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs.
Moreover, images with different noise levels can be denoised to improve the
reproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the noise
intensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs. To the authors&#x27;
knowledge, this is the first effort to improve the reproducibility of radiomic
features calculated on low dose CT scans.</span>

                                        <span>To overcome the burdens on frequent model uploads and downloads during
federated learning (FL), we propose a communication-efficient
re-parameterization, FedPara. Our method re-parameterizes the model&#x27;s layers
using low-rank matrices or tensors followed by the Hadamard product. Different
from the conventional low-rank parameterization, our method is not limited to
low-rank constraints. Thereby, our FedPara has a larger capacity than the
low-rank one, even with the same number of parameters. It can achieve
comparable performance to the original models while requiring 2.8 to 10.1 times
lower communication costs than the original models, which is not achievable by
the traditional low-rank parameterization. Moreover, the efficiency can be
further improved by combining our method and other efficient FL techniques
because our method is compatible with others. We also extend our method to a
personalized FL application, pFedPara, which separates parameters into global
and local ones. We show that pFedPara outperforms competing personalized FL
methods with more than three times fewer parameters.</span>

end-systems in order to realize privacypreserving deep neural network
computation. In conventional split learning frameworks, deep neural network
computation is separated into multiple computing systems for hiding entire
network architectures. In our proposed framework, multiple computing
end-systems are sharing one centralized server in split learning computation,
where the multiple end-systems are with input and first hidden layers and the
centralized server is with the other hidden layers and output layer. This
framework, which is called as spatio-temporal split learning, is spatially
separated for gathering data from multiple end-systems and also temporally
separated due to the nature of split learning. Our performance evaluation
verifies that our proposed framework shows nearoptimal accuracy while
preserving data privacy.</span>

                                        <span>Undertaking causal inference with observational data is incredibly useful
across a wide range of tasks including the development of medical treatments,
advertisements and marketing, and policy making. There are two significant
challenges associated with undertaking causal inference using observational
data: treatment assignment heterogeneity (i.e., differences between the treated
and untreated groups), and an absence of counterfactual data (i.e., not knowing
what would have happened if an individual who did get treatment, were instead
to have not been treated). We address these two challenges by combining
structured inference and targeted learning. In terms of structure, we factorize
the joint distribution into risk, confounding, instrumental, and miscellaneous
factors, and in terms of targeted learning, we apply a regularizer derived from
the influence curve in order to reduce residual bias. An ablation study is
undertaken, and an evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that TVAE has
competitive and state of the art performance.</span>

                                        <span>The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing
resources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)
costs. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)
for Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI
reduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the
models with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new
model to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,
reducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and
processing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search
time was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement
compared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by
the AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early
Exit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures
with minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a
class of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest
error rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%
for CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset. Further, we implemented this
image recognition architecture for other tasks, such as object detection,
semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks, and, in our experiments,
EEEA-Net-C2 outperformed MobileNet-V3 on all of these various tasks. (The
algorithm code is available at https://github.com/chakkritte/EEEA-Net).</span>

Dasgupta \cite{dasgupta2016cost}. It has been generalized by Cohen-Addad et al.
\cite{cohen2019hierarchical} to a general form named admissible function. In
this paper, we investigate hierarchical clustering from the
\emph{information-theoretic} perspective and formulate a new objective
function. We also establish the relationship between these two perspectives. In
algorithmic aspect, we get rid of the traditional top-down and bottom-up
frameworks, and propose a new one to stratify the \emph{sparsest} level of a
cluster tree recursively in guide with our objective function. For practical
use, our resulting cluster tree is not binary. Our algorithm called HCSE
outputs a $k$-level cluster tree by a novel and interpretable mechanism to
choose $k$ automatically without any hyper-parameter. Our experimental results
on synthetic datasets show that HCSE has a great advantage in finding the
intrinsic number of hierarchies, and the results on real datasets show that
HCSE also achieves competitive costs over the popular algorithms LOUVAIN and

capacity, dynamic bandwidth, reliability and heterogeneous traffic. To meet
these requirements, networks have become more complex and thus require new
design methods and monitoring techniques, as they evolve towards becoming
autonomous. Machine learning has come to the forefront in recent years as a
promising technology to aid in this evolution. Optical fiber communications can
already provide the high capacity required for most applications, however,
there is a need for increased scalability and adaptability to changing user
demands and link conditions. Accurate performance monitoring is an integral
part of this transformation. In this paper we review optical performance
monitoring techniques where machine learning algorithms have been applied.
Moreover, since alot of OPM depends on knowledge of the signal type, we also
review work for modulation format recognition and bitrate identification. We
additionally briefly introduce a neuromorphic approach to OPM as an emerging
technique that has only recently been applied to this domain.</span>

                                        <span>How to discriminatively vectorize graphs is a fundamental challenge that
attracts increasing attentions in recent years. Inspired by the recent success
of unsupervised contrastive learning, we aim to learn graph-level
representation in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we propose a novel
unsupervised graph learning paradigm called Iterative Graph Self-Distillation
(IGSD) which iteratively performs the teacher-student distillation with graph
augmentations. Different from conventional knowledge distillation, IGSD
constructs the teacher with an exponential moving average of the student model
and distills the knowledge of itself. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict
the teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented
views. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios
by jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and unsupervised
contrastive loss. Finally, we show that finetuning the IGSD-trained models with
self-training can further improve the graph representation power. Empirically,
we achieve significant and consistent performance gain on various graph
datasets in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, which well
validates the superiority of IGSD.</span>

                                        <span>Partially recorded data are frequently encountered in many applications and
usually clustered by first removing incomplete cases or features with missing
values, or by imputing missing values, followed by application of a clustering
algorithm to the resulting altered dataset. Here, we develop clustering
methodology through a model-based approach using the marginal density for the
observed values, assuming a finite mixture model of multivariate $t$
distributions. We compare our approximate algorithm to the corresponding full
expectation-maximization (EM) approach that considers the missing values in the
incomplete data set and makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption, as well as
case deletion and imputation methods. Since only the observed values are
utilized, our approach is computationally more efficient than imputation or
full EM. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach has favorable
recovery of the true cluster partition compared to case deletion and imputation
under various missingness mechanisms, and is at least competitive with the full
EM approach, even when MAR assumptions are violated. Our methodology is
demonstrated on a problem of clustering gamma-ray bursts and is implemented at

                                        <span>Motivated by the success of masked language modeling~(MLM) in pre-training
natural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for
self-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that
combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to
discretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative
speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech
representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized
tokens. In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such
as HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process,
or vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can
be optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised
tasks~(the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that
w2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art
pre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light~60k
corpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published
models such as conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows~5\%
to~10\% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets. When
applied to the Google&#x27;s Voice Search traffic dataset, w2v-BERT outperforms our
internal conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 by more than~30\% relatively.</span>

work, we develop and study a straightforward, dynamic always-sparse
pre-training approach for BERT language modeling task, which leverages periodic
compression steps based on magnitude pruning followed by random parameter

                                        <span>A promising technique for the spectral design of acoustic metamaterials is
based on the formulation of suitable constrained nonlinear optimization
problems. Unfortunately, the straightforward application of classical
gradient-based iterative optimization algorithms to the numerical solution of
such problems is typically highly demanding, due to the complexity of the
underlying physical models. Nevertheless, supervised machine learning
techniques can reduce such a computational effort, e.g., by replacing the
original objective functions of such optimization problems with more-easily
computable approximations. In this framework, the present article describes the
application of a related unsupervised machine learning technique, namely,
principal component analysis, to approximate the gradient of the objective
function of a band gap optimization problem for an acoustic metamaterial, with
the aim of making the successive application of a gradient-based iterative
optimization algorithm faster. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the
proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and
their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are &quot;data hungry&quot; and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer
parameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional
embeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of
convolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as
0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%
accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant
improvement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many
modern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based
approaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing
resources and/or dealing with small datasets. Our method also works on larger
datasets, such as ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT), and
NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at

data using convolution-free Transformer architectures. Specifically, our
Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts
multimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of
downstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal
contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of
video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and
text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic
single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We
show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based
architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT&#x27;s vision Transformer
achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and
41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.
Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
compared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the
generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.
VATT&#x27;s audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event

learn value functions of a single target policy. However, when value functions
are updated to track the learned policy, they forget potentially useful
information about old policies. We introduce a class of value functions called
Parameter-Based Value Functions (PBVFs) whose inputs include the policy
parameters. They can generalize across different policies. PBVFs can evaluate
the performance of any policy given a state, a state-action pair, or a
distribution over the RL agent&#x27;s initial states. First we show how PBVFs yield
novel off-policy policy gradient theorems. Then we derive off-policy
actor-critic algorithms based on PBVFs trained by Monte Carlo or Temporal
Difference methods. We show how learned PBVFs can zero-shot learn new policies
that outperform any policy seen during training. Finally our algorithms are
evaluated on a selection of discrete and continuous control tasks using shallow
policies and deep neural networks. Their performance is comparable to
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Following the great success of Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), in many research domains in 2010s, several ML-based approaches
were proposed for detection in large inverse linear problems, e.g., massive
MIMO systems. The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum
A-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.
Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly
different approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of
disCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and
continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete
MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding
into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters
to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent
DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet
based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate
probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft
decoding in today&#x27;s communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO
systems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off
compared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet&#x27;s soft outputs to
be reliable for decoders.</span>

safe learning methods for real-world robotic deployments from both the control
and reinforcement learning communities. This article provides a concise but
holistic review of the recent advances made in using machine learning to
achieve safe decision making under uncertainties, with a focus on unifying the
language and frameworks used in control theory and reinforcement learning
research. Our review includes: learning-based control approaches that safely
improve performance by learning the uncertain dynamics, reinforcement learning
approaches that encourage safety or robustness, and methods that can formally
certify the safety of a learned control policy. As data- and learning-based
robot control methods continue to gain traction, researchers must understand
when and how to best leverage them in real-world scenarios where safety is
imperative, such as when operating in close proximity to humans. We highlight
some of the open challenges that will drive the field of robot learning in the
coming years, and emphasize the need for realistic physics-based benchmarks to
facilitate fair comparisons between control and reinforcement learning
approaches.</span>

high-dimensional data and highlight its use in anomaly detection. The approach
is based on a statistical estimation of probability density using densities of
random subspaces combined with geometric averaging. In selecting random
subspaces, equal representation of each attribute is used to ensure correct
statistical limits. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used to create the
probability densities for each subspace with techniques included to mitigate
singularities allowing for the ability to handle both numerical and categorial
attributes. The number of components for each GMM is determined automatically
through Bayesian information criterion to prevent overfitting. The proposed
algorithm attains competitive AUC scores compared with prominent algorithms
against benchmark anomaly detection datasets with the added benefits of being
simple, scalable, and interpretable.</span>

                                        <span>Fine-grained population distribution data is of great importance for many
applications, e.g., urban planning, traffic scheduling, epidemic modeling, and
risk control. However, due to the limitations of data collection, including
infrastructure density, user privacy, and business security, such fine-grained
data is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available.
Thus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained
distribution becomes an important problem. To complete this task, existing
methods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which
is not often available. This limits the applications of these methods and
brings the necessity to transfer knowledge from data-sufficient cities to
data-scarce cities.

In knowledge transfer scenario, we employ single reference fine-grained
ground truth in the target city as the ground truth to inform the large-scale
urban structure and support the knowledge transfer in the target city. By this
approach, we transform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a
one-shot transfer learning problem for population mapping task.

In this paper, we propose a one-shot transfer learning framework, PSRNet, to
transfer spatial-temporal knowledge across cities in fine-grained population
mapping task from the view of network structure, data, and optimization.
Experiments on real-life datasets of 4 cities demonstrate that PSRNet has
significant advantages over 8 baselines by reducing RMSE and MAE for more than
25%. Our code and datasets are released in Github.</span>

witnessed a proliferation of new $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. However, our
understating of the theory of $\texttt{FL}$ is still fragmented, and a
thorough, formal comparison of these algorithms remains elusive. Motivated by
this gap, we show that many of the existing $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms can be
understood from an operator splitting point of view. This unification allows us
to compare different algorithms with ease, to refine previous convergence
results and to uncover new algorithmic variants. In particular, our analysis
reveals the vital role played by the step size in $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. The
unification also leads to a streamlined and economic way to accelerate
$\texttt{FL}$ algorithms, without incurring any communication overhead. We
perform numerical experiments on both convex and nonconvex models to validate
our findings.</span>

                                        <span>Many machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations made to
inputs either at test time or at training time. This has received much recent
interest on the empirical front due to applications where reliability and
security are critical. However, theoretical understanding of algorithms that
are robust to adversarial perturbations is limited.

In this work we focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a ubiquitous
algorithmic primitive in machine learning. We formulate a natural robust
variant of PCA where the goal is to find a low dimensional subspace to
represent the given data with minimum projection error, that is in addition
robust to small perturbations measured in $\ell_q$ norm (say $q&#x3D;\infty$).
Unlike PCA which is solvable in polynomial time, our formulation is
computationally intractable to optimize as it captures a variant of the
well-studied sparse PCA objective as a special case. We show the following
results:

-Polynomial time algorithm that is constant factor competitive in the
worst-case with respect to the best subspace, in terms of the projection error
and the robustness criterion.

-We show that our algorithmic techniques can also be made robust to
adversarial training-time perturbations, in addition to yielding
representations that are robust to adversarial perturbations at test time.
Specifically, we design algorithms for a strong notion of training-time
perturbations, where every point is adversarially perturbed up to a specified
amount.

-We illustrate the broad applicability of our algorithmic techniques in
addressing robustness to adversarial perturbations, both at training time and
test time. In particular, our adversarially robust PCA primitive leads to
computationally efficient and robust algorithms for both unsupervised and
supervised learning problems such as clustering and learning adversarially
robust classifiers.</span>

which data become available over time, like network monitoring, stock price
prediction, job applications, etc. The underlying data distribution might
evolve over time calling for model adaptation as new instances arrive and old
instances become obsolete. In such dynamic environments, the so-called data
streams, fairness-aware learning cannot be considered as a one-off requirement,
but rather it should comprise a continual requirement over the stream. Recent
fairness-aware stream classifiers ignore the problem of class imbalance, which
manifests in many real-life applications, and mitigate discrimination mainly
because they &quot;reject&quot; minority instances at large due to their inability to
effectively learn all classes.

In this work, we propose \ours, an online fairness-aware approach that
maintains a valid and fair classifier over the stream. \ours~is an online
boosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online fashion
by monitoring stream&#x27;s class imbalance and tweaks its decision boundary to
mitigate discriminatory outcomes over the stream. Experiments on 8 real-world
and 1 synthetic datasets from different domains with varying class imbalance
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art fairness-aware
stream approaches with a range (relative) increase [11.2\%-14.2\%] in balanced

recommending products by combining several techniques and algorithms to form a
pool that would bring forward the most enhanced models for making the
predictions. Building on these lines is our paper focused on the application of
sentiment analysis for recommendation in the insurance domain. We tried
building the following Machine Learning models namely, Logistic Regression,
Multinomial Naive Bayes, and the mighty Random Forest for analyzing the
polarity of a given feedback line given by a customer. Then we used this
polarity along with other attributes like Age, Gender, Locality, Income, and
the list of other products already purchased by our existing customers as input
for our recommendation model. Then we matched the polarity score along with the
user&#x27;s profiles and generated the list of insurance products to be recommended
in descending order. Despite our model&#x27;s simplicity and the lack of the key
data sets, the results seemed very logical and realistic. So, by developing the
model with more enhanced methods and with access to better and true data
gathered from an insurance industry may be the sector could be very well

                                        <span>Neural networks are versatile tools for computation, having the ability to
approximate a broad range of functions. An important problem in the theory of
deep neural networks is expressivity; that is, we want to understand the
functions that are computable by a given network. We study real infinitely
differentiable (smooth) hierarchical functions implemented by feedforward
neural networks via composing simpler functions in two cases:

1) each constituent function of the composition has fewer inputs than the
resulting function;

2) constituent functions are in the more specific yet prevalent form of a
non-linear univariate function (e.g. tanh) applied to a linear multivariate
function.

We establish that in each of these regimes there exist non-trivial algebraic
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are satisfied by the computed
functions. These PDEs are purely in terms of the partial derivatives and are
dependent only on the topology of the network. For compositions of polynomial
functions, the algebraic PDEs yield non-trivial equations (of degrees dependent
only on the architecture) in the ambient polynomial space that are satisfied on
the associated functional varieties. Conversely, we conjecture that such PDE
constraints, once accompanied by appropriate non-singularity conditions and
perhaps certain inequalities involving partial derivatives, guarantee that the
smooth function under consideration can be represented by the network. The
conjecture is verified in numerous examples including the case of tree
architectures which are of neuroscientific interest. Our approach is a step
toward formulating an algebraic description of functional spaces associated
with specific neural networks, and may provide new, useful tools for
constructing neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>In reacting flow systems, thermoacoustic instability characterized by high
amplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the
unsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the
underlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied
and the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure
oscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,
during the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the
system dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations
via a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled
by coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,
each estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the
flame, to acoustic fluctuations are characterized by introducing external
unsteady forcing. This necessitates a powerful excitation module to obtain the
nonlinear response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. Instead of
characterizing individual subsystems, we introduce a neural ordinary
differential equation (neural ODE) framework to model the thermoacoustic system
as a whole. The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series
of the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously
without introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled
interaction. Further, we use the parameters of neural ODE to define an anomaly
measure that represents the proximity of system dynamics to limit cycle
oscillations and thus provide an early warning signal for the onset of
thermoacoustic instability.</span>

                                        <span>State preparation is of fundamental importance in quantum physics, which can
be realized by constructing the quantum circuit as a unitary that transforms
the initial state to the target, or implementing a quantum control protocol to
evolve to the target state with a designed Hamiltonian. In this work, we study
the latter on quantum many-body systems by the time evolution with fixed
couplings and variational magnetic fields. In specific, we consider to prepare
the ground states of the Hamiltonians containing certain interactions that are
missing in the Hamiltonians for the time evolution. An optimization method is
proposed to optimize the magnetic fields by &quot;fine-graining&quot; the discretization
of time, in order to gain high precision and stability. The back propagation
technique is utilized to obtain the gradients of the fields against the
logarithmic fidelity. Our method is tested on preparing the ground state of
Heisenberg chain with the time evolution by the XY and Ising interactions, and
its performance surpasses two baseline methods that use local and global
optimization strategies, respectively. Our work can be applied and generalized
to other quantum models such as those defined on higher dimensional lattices.
It enlightens to reduce the complexity of the required interactions for
implementing quantum control or other tasks in quantum information and
computation by means of optimizing the magnetic fields.</span>

                                        <span>We study active learning of homogeneous $s$-sparse halfspaces in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ under the setting where the unlabeled data distribution is
isotropic log-concave and each label is flipped with probability at most $\eta$
for a parameter $\eta \in \big[0, \frac12\big)$, known as the bounded noise.
Even in the presence of mild label noise, i.e. $\eta$ is a small constant, this
is a challenging problem and only recently have label complexity bounds of the
form $\tilde{O}\big(s \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(d, \frac{1}{\epsilon})\big)$ been
established in [Zhang, 2018] for computationally efficient algorithms. In
contrast, under high levels of label noise, the label complexity bounds
achieved by computationally efficient algorithms are much worse: the best known
result of [Awasthi et al., 2016] provides a computationally efficient algorithm
with label complexity $\tilde{O}\big((\frac{s \ln
d}{\epsilon})^{2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/(1-2\eta))}} \big)$, which is label-efficient
only when the noise rate $\eta$ is a fixed constant. In this work, we
substantially improve on it by designing a polynomial time algorithm for active
learning of $s$-sparse halfspaces, with a label complexity of
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{s}{(1-2\eta)^4} \mathrm{polylog} (d, \frac 1 \epsilon)
\big)$. This is the first efficient algorithm with label complexity polynomial
in $\frac{1}{1-2\eta}$ in this setting, which is label-efficient even for
$\eta$ arbitrarily close to $\frac12$. Our active learning algorithm and its
theoretical guarantees also immediately translate to new state-of-the-art label
and sample complexity results for full-dimensional active and passive halfspace
learning under arbitrary bounded noise. The key insight of our algorithm and
analysis is a new interpretation of online learning regret inequalities, which
may be of independent interest.</span>

This study investigates contrastive learning as a potential method to improve

representation learning to learn a structured latent space capable of
separately clustering multiple classes. It has been shown to produce state of

weighted contrastive loss suitable for regression tasks applied to a

                                        <span>Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research
on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls
short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation
datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.
This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to
classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can
learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large
sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially
selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of
interest. These approaches choose speci?fic unlabeled instances by a query
function that are expected to improve overall classi?cation performance. The
resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the
labeled set.

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it
determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it
is to enhance classi?cation. These properties are the uncertainty score and
anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the
model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly
selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query
strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL
methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.
We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently
obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only
anomalies or a ?fixed combination of the two.</span>

                                        <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                                        <span>Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the
fast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,
Microsoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to
wake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm
manually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,
such as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a
system that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder
list. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named
entity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the
web is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative
sentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object
extraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of
interest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading
Comprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by
formulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended
to the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by
our proposed model for tracking objects kept during the &quot;packing activity.&quot;
Eventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent
containing the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance
compared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.</span>

computationally efficient algorithms in the more prevalent oblivious setting,
establishing a regret bound of $O(T/S)$ for general convex losses and
$\widetilde O(T/S^2)$ for strongly convex losses. In addition, for stochastic
i.i.d.~losses, we present a simple algorithm that performs $\log T$ switches

model size improves performance. On the other hand, latency and connectivity
considerations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a
digital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant the ability to discuss
just about anything leads to the need for reducing the chatbot model size such
that it fits on the user&#x27;s device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can
simultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while
improving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework
that accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout
multi-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic
responses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing
transactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital
assistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4
public benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA -
Sensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish
comparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%.</span>

                                        <span>Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building
autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

recurrent autoencoders to the problem of detecting gravitational wave signals
in laser interferometers. Trained on noise data, this class of algorithms could
detect signals using an unsupervised strategy, i.e., without targeting a
specific kind of source. We develop a custom architecture to analyze the data
from two interferometers. We compare the obtained performance to that obtained
with other autoencoder architectures and with a convolutional classifier. The
unsupervised nature of the proposed strategy comes with a cost in terms of
accuracy, when compared to more traditional supervised techniques. On the other
hand, there is a qualitative gain in generalizing the experimental sensitivity
beyond the ensemble of pre-computed signal templates. The recurrent autoencoder
outperforms other autoencoders based on different architectures. The class of
recurrent autoencoders presented in this paper could complement the search
strategy employed for gravitational wave detection and extend the reach of the
ongoing detection campaigns.</span>

                                        <span>Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability
and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction
capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the
most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no
specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it
largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we
investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of
people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as
human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we
do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group
activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,
first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine
a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation
can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very
diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we
provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and
group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also
put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible
concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on
methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation
approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and
limitations in current literature along with possible future research
directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing
methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and
provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.</span>

slides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain is used in the
diagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,
in many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional &quot;special
stains&quot; are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue
components and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this
study, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational
stain transformation from H&amp;E to different special stains (Masson&#x27;s Trichrome,
periodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney
needle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed
by adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of
virtual special stains from existing H&amp;E images improves the diagnosis in
several non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A
second study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the
special stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically
equivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the
transformation of H&amp;E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min
or less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation
framework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional
special stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,
reducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.
Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent
remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.
Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the
hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target
domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source
hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade
the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,
motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are
essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are
essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in
UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other
parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,
which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose
Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by
domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the
memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the
distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and
untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate
updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image
classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar
outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments
demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA
networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift
scenarios.</span>

Disease diagnosis use different biomarker combinations to classify patients,
but do not allow extracting knowledge about the interactions of biomarkers.
However, to improve our understanding of the disease, it is paramount to
extract such knowledge from the learned model. In this paper, we propose a Deep
Factorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex
relationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed
model has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical
data, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,
and (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our
experiments on data from the Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we
demonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive
impaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In
addition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among
biomarkers can be obtained.</span>

children playing, adults working together (i.e., team sports), or strangers
navigating through a crowd. Joint action brings individuals (and embodiment of
their emotions) together, in space and in time. Yet little is known about how
individual emotions propagate through embodied presence in a group, and how
joint action changes individual emotion. In fact, the multi-agent component is
largely missing from neuroscience-based approaches to emotion, and reversely
joint action research has not found a way yet to include emotion as one of the
key parameters to model socio-motor interaction. In this review, we first
identify the gap and then stockpile evidence showing strong entanglement
between emotion and acting together from various branches of sciences. We
propose an integrative approach to bridge the gap, highlight five research
avenues to do so in behavioral neuroscience and digital sciences, and address
some of the key challenges in the area faced by modern societies.</span>

                                        <span>Acoustic scene classification (ASC) has been approached in the last years
using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks or
recurrent neural networks. Many state-of-the-art solutions are based on image
classification frameworks and, as such, a 2D representation of the audio signal
is considered for training these networks. Finding the most suitable audio
representation is still a research area of interest. In this paper, different
log-Mel representations and combinations are analyzed. Experiments show that
the best results are obtained using the harmonic and percussive components plus
the difference between left and right stereo channels, (L-R). On the other
hand, it is a common strategy to ensemble different models in order to increase
the final accuracy. Even though averaging different model predictions is a
common choice, an exhaustive analysis of different ensemble techniques has not
been presented in ASC problems. In this paper, geometric and arithmetic mean
plus the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator are studied as aggregation
operators for the output of the different models of the ensemble. Finally, the
work carried out in this paper is highly oriented towards real-time
implementations. In this context, as the number of applications for audio
classification on edge devices is increasing exponentially, we also analyze
different network depths and efficient solutions for aggregating ensemble
predictions.</span>

                                        <span>Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing
learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated
medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust
medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised
approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,
and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to
previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream
tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.</span>

                                        <span>Human-robot interactive decision-making is increasingly becoming ubiquitous,
and trust is an influential factor in determining the reliance on autonomy.
However, it is not reasonable to trust systems that are beyond our
comprehension, and typical machine learning and data-driven decision-making are
black-box paradigms that impede interpretability. Therefore, it is critical to
establish computational trustworthy decision-making mechanisms enhanced by
interpretability-aware strategies. To this end, we propose a Trustworthy
Decision-Making (TDM) framework, which integrates symbolic planning into
sequential decision-making. The framework learns interpretable subtasks that
result in a complex, higher-level composite task that can be formally evaluated
using the proposed trust metric. TDM enables the subtask-level interpretability
by design and converges to an optimal symbolic plan from the learned subtasks.
Moreover, a TDM-based algorithm is introduced to demonstrate the unification of
symbolic planning with other sequential-decision making algorithms, reaping the
benefits of both. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of
trust-score-based planning while improving the interpretability of subtasks.</span>

                                        <span>A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive
datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n x n kernel
matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on
approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m
inducing points. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most
scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using
structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m)
for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very
large data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation
for extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced
to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as
solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m
compact basis functions. With per-iteration complexity independent of the
dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets.
We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the
method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over
100 million points.</span>

                                        <span>Embedding nodes of a large network into a metric (e.g., Euclidean) space has
become an area of active research in statistical machine learning, which has
found applications in natural and social sciences. Generally, a representation
of a network object is learned in a Euclidean geometry and is then used for
subsequent tasks regarding the nodes and/or edges of the network, such as
community detection, node classification and link prediction. Network embedding
algorithms have been proposed in multiple disciplines, often with
domain-specific notations and details. In addition, different measures and
tools have been adopted to evaluate and compare the methods proposed under
different settings, often dependent of the downstream tasks. As a result, it is
challenging to study these algorithms in the literature systematically.
Motivated by the recently proposed Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework, we
propose a framework for network embedding algorithms and discuss how the
principles of predictability, computability and stability apply in this
context. The utilization of this framework in network embedding holds the
potential to motivate and point to new directions for future research.</span>

vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the graph structure. Although multiple
works have been proposed to improve their robustness against such structural
adversarial attacks, the reasons for the success of the attacks remain unclear.
In this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that structural
adversarial examples can be attributed to the non-robust aggregation scheme
(i.e., the weighted mean) of GCNs. Specifically, our analysis takes advantage
of the breakdown point which can quantitatively measure the robustness of
aggregation schemes. The key insight is that weighted mean, as the basic design
of GCNs, has a low breakdown point and its output can be dramatically changed
by injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a
high breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance
the robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method
achieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest
as it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.

Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions
(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their
recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important
challenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,
yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in
challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard
classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate
the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they
lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing
false-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the
model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while
discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a
criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier
decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses
evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform
distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the
latter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a
cross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class
prediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model
uncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced
segmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public
GlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer
show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm
the effect of our new regularizers.</span>

                                        <span>To accelerate the existing Broad Learning System (BLS) for new added nodes in
[7], we extend the inverse Cholesky factorization in [10] to deduce an
efficient inverse Cholesky factorization for a Hermitian matrix partitioned
into 2 * 2 blocks, which is utilized to develop the proposed BLS algorithm 1.
The proposed BLS algorithm 1 compute the ridge solution (i.e, the output
weights) from the inverse Cholesky factor of the Hermitian matrix in the ridge
inverse, and update the inverse Cholesky factor efficiently. From the proposed
BLS algorithm 1, we deduce the proposed ridge inverse, which can be obtained
from the generalized inverse in [7] by just change one matrix in the equation
to compute the newly added sub-matrix. We also modify the proposed algorithm 1
into the proposed algorithm 2, which is equivalent to the existing BLS
algorithm [7] in terms of numerical computations. The proposed algorithms 1 and
2 can reduce the computational complexity, since usually the Hermitian matrix
in the ridge inverse is smaller than the ridge inverse. With respect to the
existing BLS algorithm, the proposed algorithms 1 and 2 usually require about
13 and 2 3 of complexities, respectively, while in numerical experiments they
achieve the speedups (in each additional training time) of 2.40 - 2.91 and 1.36
- 1.60, respectively. Numerical experiments also show that the proposed
algorithm 1 and the standard ridge solution always bear the same testing
accuracy, and usually so do the proposed algorithm 2 and the existing BLS
algorithm. The existing BLS assumes the ridge parameter lamda-&gt;0, since it is
based on the generalized inverse with the ridge regression approximation. When
the assumption of lamda-&gt; 0 is not satisfied, the standard ridge solution
obviously achieves a better testing accuracy than the existing BLS algorithm in
numerical experiments.</span>

However, most of the existing latent factor models assume both historical
interactions and embedding dimensions are independent of each other, and thus
regrettably ignore the high-order interaction information among historical
interactions and embedding dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel latent
factor model called COMET (COnvolutional diMEnsion inTeraction), which
simultaneously model the high-order interaction patterns among historical
interactions and embedding dimensions. To be specific, COMET stacks the
embeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in
two &quot;embedding maps&quot;. In this way, internal interactions and dimensional
interactions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks with kernels of
different sizes simultaneously. A fully-connected multi-layer perceptron is
then applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of
users and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can
further be used to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies on various public implicit feedback datasets clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness and the rationality of our proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>The Backprop algorithm for learning in neural networks utilizes two
mechanisms: first, stochastic gradient descent and second, initialization with
small random weights, where the latter is essential to the effectiveness of the
former. We show that in continual learning setups, Backprop performs well
initially, but over time its performance degrades. Stochastic gradient descent
alone is insufficient to learn continually; the initial randomness enables only
initial learning but not continual learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours
is the first result showing this degradation in Backprop&#x27;s ability to learn. To
address this issue, we propose an algorithm that continually injects random
features alongside gradient descent using a new generate-and-test process. We
call this the Continual Backprop algorithm. We show that, unlike Backprop,
Continual Backprop is able to continually adapt in both supervised and
reinforcement learning problems. We expect that as continual learning becomes
more common in future applications, a method like Continual Backprop will be
essential where the advantages of random initialization are present throughout
learning.</span>

                                        <span>Mining dense subgraphs where vertices connect closely with each other is a
common task when analyzing graphs. A very popular notion in subgraph analysis
is core decomposition. Recently, Esfahani et al. presented a probabilistic core
decomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
that is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm
(PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these
vertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices
until it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly
in biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense
sub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not
interact much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense
subgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a
two-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing
vertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the
graph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that
we are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA
and with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not
identical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and
clustering coefficient).</span>

                                        <span>In-game win probability models, which provide a sports team&#x27;s likelihood of
winning at each point in a game based on historical observations, are becoming
increasingly popular. In baseball, basketball and American football, they have
become important tools to enhance fan experience, to evaluate in-game
decision-making, and to inform coaching decisions. While equally relevant in
soccer, the adoption of these models is held back by technical challenges
arising from the low-scoring nature of the sport.

In this paper, we introduce an in-game win probability model for soccer that
addresses the shortcomings of existing models. First, we demonstrate that
in-game win probability models for other sports struggle to provide accurate
estimates for soccer, especially towards the end of a game. Second, we
introduce a novel Bayesian statistical framework that estimates running win,
tie and loss probabilities by leveraging a set of contextual game state
features. An empirical evaluation on eight seasons of data for the top-five
soccer leagues demonstrates that our framework provides well-calibrated
probabilities. Furthermore, two use cases show its ability to enhance fan
experience and to evaluate performance in crucial game situations.</span>

only a set of positive instances are labelled, while the rest of the data set
is unlabelled. The unlabelled instances may be either unspecified positive
samples or true negative samples. Over the years, many solutions have been
proposed to deal with PU learning. Some techniques consider the unlabelled
samples as negative ones, reducing the problem to a binary classification with
a noisy negative set, while others aim to detect sets of possible negative
examples to later apply a supervised machine learning strategy (two-step
techniques). The approach proposed in this work falls in the latter category
and works in a semi-supervised fashion: motivated and inspired by previous
works, a Markov diffusion process with restart is used to assign pseudo-labels
to unlabelled instances. Afterward, a machine learning model, exploiting the
newly assigned classes, is trained. The principal aim of the algorithm is to
identify a set of instances which are likely to contain positive instances that
were originally unlabelled.</span>

high-dimensional time series data that lie on a low-dimensional manifold, as
arises for many processes. For an arbitrary manifold, there is no smooth global
coordinate representation, so following the formalism of differential topology
we represent the manifold as an atlas of charts. We first partition the data
into overlapping regions. Then undercomplete autoencoders are used to find
low-dimensional coordinate representations for each region. We then use the
data to learn dynamical models in each region, which together yield a global
low-dimensional dynamical model. We apply this method to examples ranging from
simple periodic dynamics to complex, nominally high-dimensional non-periodic
bursting dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We demonstrate that it:
(1) can yield dynamical models of the lowest possible dimension, where previous
methods generally cannot; (2) exhibits computational benefits including
scalability, parallelizability, and adaptivity; and (3) separates state space
into regions of distinct behaviours.</span>

challenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training
neural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to
beat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we
utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract
summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a
decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a
Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary
abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of
words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a
news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting
dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting
dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,
such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI
meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.
We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2
score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also
report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for
abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring
word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous
models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,
a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these
summaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important
information from the transcripts.</span>

                                        <span>The delayed feedback problem is one of the imperative challenges in online
advertising, which is caused by the highly diversified feedback delay of a
conversion varying from a few minutes to several days. It is hard to design an
appropriate online learning system under these non-identical delay for
different types of ads and users. In this paper, we propose to tackle the
delayed feedback problem in online advertising by &quot;Following the Prophet&quot; (FTP
for short). The key insight is that, if the feedback came instantly for all the
logged samples, we could get a model without delayed feedback, namely the
&quot;prophet&quot;. Although the prophet cannot be obtained during online learning, we
show that we could predict the prophet&#x27;s predictions by an aggregation policy
on top of a set of multi-task predictions, where each task captures the
feedback patterns of different periods. We propose the objective and
optimization approach for the policy, and use the logged data to imitate the
prophet. Extensive experiments on three real-world advertising datasets show
that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Ocean current, fluid mechanics, and many other spatio-temporal physical
dynamical systems are essential components of the universe. One key
characteristic of such systems is that certain physics laws -- represented as
ordinary/partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) -- largely dominate the
whole process, irrespective of time or location. Physics-informed learning has
recently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack
a mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on
hard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled
neural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system,
and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring
dynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is
proposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics
parameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal
regions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The
physics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously
improved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range
forecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and
field-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing
physics-informed models.</span>

observable grid environments. This problem is challenging for centralized
planning approaches as they, typically, rely on the full knowledge of the
environment. We suggest utilizing the reinforcement learning approach when the
agents, first, learn the policies that map observations to actions and then
follow these policies to reach their goals. To tackle the challenge associated
with learning cooperative behavior, i.e. in many cases agents need to yield to
each other to accomplish a mission, we use a mixing Q-network that complements
learning individual policies. In the experimental evaluation, we show that such
approach leads to plausible results and scales well to large number of agents.</span>

estimating the correct posture due to occlusion or suffer from less accurate
ergonomics models in their postural optimization methods. Instead, we propose a
novel framework for posture estimation, assessment, and optimization for
ergonomically intelligent physical human-robot interaction. We show that we can
estimate human posture solely from the trajectory of the interacting robot. We
propose DULA, a differentiable ergonomics model, and use it in gradient-free

                                        <span>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a flexible and powerful framework that is
suitable for computationally expensive simulation-based applications and
guarantees statistical convergence to the global optimum. While remaining as
one of the most popular optimization methods, its capability is hindered by the
size of data, the dimensionality of the considered problem, and the nature of
sequential optimization. These scalability issues are intertwined with each
other and must be tackled simultaneously. In this work, we propose the
Scalable$^3$-BO framework, which employs sparse GP as the underlying surrogate
model to scope with Big Data and is equipped with a random embedding to
efficiently optimize high-dimensional problems with low effective
dimensionality. The Scalable$^3$-BO framework is further leveraged with
asynchronous parallelization feature, which fully exploits the computational
resource on HPC within a computational budget. As a result, the proposed
Scalable$^3$-BO framework is scalable in three independent perspectives: with
respect to data size, dimensionality, and computational resource on HPC. The
goal of this work is to push the frontiers of BO beyond its well-known
scalability issues and minimize the wall-clock waiting time for optimizing
high-dimensional computationally expensive applications. We demonstrate the
capability of Scalable$^3$-BO with 1 million data points, 10,000-dimensional
problems, with 20 concurrent workers in an HPC environment.</span>

electromagnetic (EM) measurements. We present a methodology to construct a deep
neural network (DNN) model trained to reproduce a full set of extra-deep EM
logs consisting of 22 measurements per logging position. The model is trained
in a 1D layered environment consisting of up to seven layers with different
resistivity values. A commercial simulator provided by a tool vendor is used to
generate a training dataset. The dataset size is limited because the simulator
provided by the vendor is optimized for sequential execution. Therefore, we
design a training dataset that embraces the geological rules and geosteering
specifics supported by the forward model. We use this dataset to produce an EM
simulator based on a DNN without access to the proprietary information about
the EM tool configuration or the original simulator source code. Despite
employing a relatively small training set size, the resulting DNN forward model
is quite accurate for the considered examples: a multi-layer synthetic case and
a section of a published historical operation from the Goliat Field. The
observed average evaluation time of 0.15 ms per logging position makes it also
suitable for future use as part of evaluation-hungry statistical and/or
Monte-Carlo inversion algorithms within geosteering workflows.</span>

rotating shaft to simulate the vibration signature of faults like cracks in
different components aiming towards simulated data-driven machine learning. We
have employed lumped and one-dimensional analytical models of the subcomponents
for better insight into the complex dynamic response. The framework seeks to
address some of the challenges encountered in analyzing and optimizing fault
detection and identification schemes for health monitoring of rotating
turbomachinery, including aero-engines. We model the bladed disks and shafts by
combining lumped elements and one-dimensional finite elements, leading to a
coupled system. The simulation results are in good agreement with previously
published data. We model the cracks in a blade analytically with their
effective reduced stiffness approximation. Multiple types of faults are
modeled, including cracks in the blades of single and two-stage bladed disks,
Fan Blade Off (FBO), and Foreign Object Damage (FOD). We have applied
aero-engine operational loading conditions to simulate realistic scenarios of
online health monitoring. The proposed reduced-order simulation framework will
have applications in probabilistic signal modeling, machine learning toward
fault signature identification, and parameter estimation with measured
vibration signals.</span>

                                        <span>Recent works have demonstrated great success in training high-capacity
autoregressive language models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) on a huge amount of
unlabeled text corpus for text generation. Despite showing great results, this
generates two training efficiency challenges. First, training large corpora can
be extremely timing consuming, and how to present training samples to the model
to improve the token-wise convergence speed remains a challenging and open
question. Second, many of these large models have to be trained with hundreds
or even thousands of processors using data-parallelism with a very large batch
size. Despite of its better compute efficiency, it has been observed that
large-batch training often runs into training instability issue or converges to
solutions with bad generalization performance. To overcome these two
challenges, we present a study of a curriculum learning based approach, which
helps improves the pre-training convergence speed of autoregressive models.
More importantly, we find that curriculum learning, as a regularization method,
exerts a gradient variance reduction effect and enables to train autoregressive
models with much larger batch sizes and learning rates without training
instability, further improving the training speed. Our evaluations demonstrate
that curriculum learning enables training GPT-2 models (with up to 1.5B
parameters) with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the
baseline approach struggles with training divergence. To achieve the same
validation perplexity targets during pre-training, curriculum learning reduces
the required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 59% and 54%,
respectively. To achieve the same or better zero-shot WikiText-103/LAMBADA
evaluation results at the end of pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the
required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 13% and 61%,
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Both latent semantic analysis (LSA) and correspondence analysis (CA) use a
singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. In this
article, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied
in both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining
interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three
mechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying
framework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA
and LSA as special cases. In the authorship attribution example, the national
anthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is
illustrated.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender
systems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix
factorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After
recent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show
state-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based
on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN
concept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method
of Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty
in our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,
i) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed
ones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,
and iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set
of neural network connections. We also present a novel training method
specialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,
Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better
accuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442
by LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in
Amazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth
mentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather
than linear connections.</span>

technical concerns that are the usual focus of academic research, the
operational challenges of inconsistent regulatory pressures, conflicting
business goals, data quality issues, development processes, systems integration
practices, and the scale of deployment all conspire to create new ethical
risks. Such ethical concerns arising from these practical considerations are
not adequately addressed by existing research results. We argue that a holistic
consideration of ethics in the development and deployment of AI systems is
necessary for building ethical AI in practice, and exhort researchers to
consider the full operational contexts of AI systems when assessing ethical

and complexity of machine learning tasks. Various tools and techniques are
available that assess data quality with respect to general cleaning and
profiling checks. However these techniques are not applicable to detect data
issues in the context of machine learning tasks, like noisy labels, existence
of overlapping classes etc. We attempt to re-look at the data quality issues in
the context of building a machine learning pipeline and build a tool that can
detect, explain and remediate issues in the data, and systematically and
automatically capture all the changes applied to the data. We introduce the
Data Quality Toolkit for machine learning as a library of some key quality
metrics and relevant remediation techniques to analyze and enhance the
readiness of structured training datasets for machine learning projects. The
toolkit can reduce the turn-around times of data preparation pipelines and
streamline the data quality assessment process. Our toolkit is publicly
available via IBM API Hub [1] platform, any developer can assess the data
quality using the IBM&#x27;s Data Quality for AI apis [2]. Detailed tutorials are
also available on IBM Learning Path [3].</span>

                                        <span>We present a framework for learning multimodal representations from unlabeled
data using convolution-free Transformer architectures. Specifically, our
Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts
multimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of
downstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal
contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of
video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and
text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic
single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We
show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based
architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT&#x27;s vision Transformer
achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and
41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.
Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
compared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the
generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.
VATT&#x27;s audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event
recognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4% on AudioSet without any supervised
pre-training. VATT&#x27;s source code is publicly available.</span>

single modality such as text. However, such toxic information could also be
communicated via multimodal content such as online memes. Therefore, detecting
multimodal hateful content has recently garnered much attention in academic and
industry research communities. This paper aims to contribute to this emerging
research topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that
performed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically,
DisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to
improve hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive
experiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our
experiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform
state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme
classification task. Empirical case studies were also conducted to demonstrate
DisMultiHate&#x27;s ability to disentangle target entities in memes and ultimately
showcase DisMultiHate&#x27;s explainability of the multimodal hateful content

                                        <span>Computer-generated holographic (CGH) displays show great potential and are
emerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality, and
automotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems harming the wide
adoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to
holography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts.
Although speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the
previous works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human
Visual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is
well studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual
field, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the
perceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we
present the first method that reduces the &quot;perceived speckle noise&quot; by
integrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with
the retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation.
Specifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor
distribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a
higher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being
adaptable to any individual&#x27;s optical aberration on the retina. Our method
demonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display.
Our evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate
a significant reduction of the human perceived noise.</span>

                                        <span>Recent methods for visual question answering rely on large-scale annotated
datasets. Manual annotation of questions and answers for videos, however, is
tedious, expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we propose to avoid
manual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video
question answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage
a question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate
question-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,
we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M
video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse
answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive
loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer
transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent
results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,
ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. Finally, for a detailed evaluation we introduce
iVQA, a new VideoQA dataset with reduced language biases and high-quality
redundant manual annotations. Our code, datasets and trained models are

                                        <span>As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become
increasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)
speech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and
their variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart
from being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low
user-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This
work examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training
criteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our
analyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),
or measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model&#x27;s ability
to process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.
Thus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in
accurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded
devices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and
endpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off
between latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with
endpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization
mechanism.</span>

                                        <span>Word alignment over parallel corpora has a wide variety of applications,
including learning translation lexicons, cross-lingual transfer of language
processing tools, and automatic evaluation or analysis of translation outputs.
The great majority of past work on word alignment has worked by performing
unsupervised learning on parallel texts. Recently, however, other work has
demonstrated that pre-trained contextualized word embeddings derived from
multilingually trained language models (LMs) prove an attractive alternative,
achieving competitive results on the word alignment task even in the absence of
explicit training on parallel data. In this paper, we examine methods to marry
the two approaches: leveraging pre-trained LMs but fine-tuning them on parallel
text with objectives designed to improve alignment quality, and proposing
methods to effectively extract alignments from these fine-tuned models. We
perform experiments on five language pairs and demonstrate that our model can
consistently outperform previous state-of-the-art models of all varieties. In
addition, we demonstrate that we are able to train multilingual word aligners
that can obtain robust performance on different language pairs. Our aligner,
AWESOME (Aligning Word Embedding Spaces of Multilingual Encoders), with
pre-trained models is available at https://github.com/neulab/awesome-align</span>

reliability of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. To address this,
lexically constrained NMT explores various methods to ensure pre-specified
words and phrases appear in the translation output. However, in many cases,
those methods are studied on general domain corpora, where the terms are mostly
uni- and bi-grams (&gt;98%). In this paper, we instead tackle a more challenging
setup consisting of domain-specific corpora with much longer n-gram and highly
specialized terms. Inspired by the recent success of masked span prediction
models, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that achieves
consistent improvements on both terminology and sentence-level translation for
three domain-specific corpora in two language pairs.</span>

computation. An automaton is k-ambiguous (for k &gt; 0) if for every input it has
at most k accepting computations. An automaton is boundedly ambiguous if it is
k-ambiguous for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. An automaton is finitely
(respectively, countably) ambiguous if for every input it has at most finitely
(respectively, countably) many accepting computations.

The degree of ambiguity of a regular language is defined in a natural way. A
language is k-ambiguous (respectively, boundedly, finitely, countably
ambiguous) if it is accepted by a k-ambiguous (respectively, boundedly,
finitely, countably ambiguous) automaton. Over finite words every regular
language is accepted by a deterministic automaton. Over finite trees every
regular language is accepted by an unambiguous automaton. Over $\omega$-words
every regular language is accepted by an unambiguous B\&quot;uchi automaton and by a
deterministic parity automaton. Over infinite trees Carayol et al. showed that
there are ambiguous languages.

We show that over infinite trees there is a hierarchy of degrees of
ambiguity: For every k &gt; 1 there are k-ambiguous languages that are not k - 1
ambiguous; and there are finitely (respectively countably, uncountably)
ambiguous languages that are not boundedly (respectively finitely, countably)
ambiguous.</span>

disentangle the text&#x27;s content and style attributes for text style transfer.
While the style classifier plays a critical role in existing TST methods, there
is no known investigation on its effect on the TST methods. In this paper, we
conduct an empirical study on the limitations of the style classifiers used in
existing TST methods. We demonstrate that the existing style classifiers cannot
learn sentence syntax effectively and ultimately worsen existing TST models&#x27;
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Syntax-Aware
Controllable Generation (SACG) model, which includes a syntax-aware style
classifier that ensures learned style latent representations effectively
capture the syntax information for TST. Through extensive experiments on two
popular TST tasks, we show that our proposed method significantly outperforms

higher-order predicate logic with natural numbers and alternating fixed-points.
Ours is the first cyclic proof system for a higher-order logic, to our
knowledge. Due to the presence of higher-order predicates and alternating
fixed-points, our cyclic proof system requires a more delicate global condition
on cyclic proofs than the original system of Brotherston and Simpson. We prove
the decidability of checking the global condition and soundness of this system,
and also prove a restricted form of standard completeness for an infinitary

                                        <span>Generating responses that are consistent with the dialogue context is one of
the central challenges in building engaging conversational agents. We
demonstrate that neural conversation models can be geared towards generating
consistent responses by maintaining certain features related to topics and
personas throughout the conversation. Past work has required external
supervision that exploits features such as user identities that are often
unavailable. In our approach, topic and persona feature extractors are trained
using a contrastive training scheme that utilizes the natural structure of
dialogue data. We further adopt a feature disentangling loss which, paired with
controllable response generation techniques, allows us to promote or demote
certain learned topics and persona features. Evaluation results demonstrate the
model&#x27;s ability to capture meaningful topics and persona features. The
incorporation of the learned features brings significant improvement in terms
of the quality of generated responses on two dialogue datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Models of context-sensitive communication often use the Rational Speech Act
framework (RSA; Frank &amp; Goodman, 2012), which formulates listeners and speakers
in a cooperative reasoning process. However, the standard RSA formulation can
only be applied to small domains, and large-scale applications have relied on
imitating human behavior. Here, we propose a new approach to scalable
pragmatics, building upon recent theoretical results (Zaslavsky et al., 2020)
that characterize pragmatic reasoning in terms of general information-theoretic
principles. Specifically, we propose an architecture and learning process in
which agents acquire pragmatic policies via self-supervision instead of
imitating human data. This work suggests a new principled approach for
equipping artificial agents with pragmatic skills via self-supervision, which
is grounded both in pragmatic theory and in information theory.</span>

variety of industrial and enterprise settings, including in its use for
information extraction, specifically named entity recognition and relation
extraction, from documents such as engineering manuals and field maintenance
reports. While named entity recognition is a well-studied problem, existing
state-of-the-art approaches require large labelled datasets which are hard to
acquire for sensitive data such as maintenance records. Further, industrial
domain experts tend to distrust results from black box machine learning models,
especially when the extracted information is used in downstream predictive
maintenance analytics. We overcome these challenges by developing three
approaches built on the foundation of domain expert knowledge captured in
dictionaries and ontologies. We develop a syntactic and semantic rules-based
approach and an approach leveraging a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned
for a question-answering task on top of our base dictionary lookup to extract
entities of interest from maintenance records. We also develop a preliminary
ontology to represent and capture the semantics of maintenance records. Our
evaluations on a real-world aviation maintenance records dataset show promising
results and help identify challenges specific to named entity recognition in
the context of noisy industrial data.</span>

                                        <span>Moving towards human-like linguistic performance is often argued to require
compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
typically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of
input fragments can be guaranteed and their meanings algebraically composed.
However, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this
rigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial
compositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural
models deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we
re-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate
them for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main
issues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to
(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an
empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation
of compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing
meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.</span>

that gained a lot of traction in recent years, mostly via SIGMORPHON&#x27;s
shared-tasks. With average accuracy above 0.9 over the scores of all languages,
the task is considered mostly solved using relatively generic neural
sequence-to-sequence models, even with little data provided. In this work, we
propose to re-evaluate morphological inflection models by employing harder
train-test splits that will challenge the generalization capacity of the
models. In particular, as opposed to the na\&quot;ive split-by-form, we propose a
split-by-lemma method to challenge the performance on existing benchmarks. Our
experiments with the three top-ranked systems on the SIGMORPHON&#x27;s 2020
shared-task show that the lemma-split presents an average drop of 30 percentage
points in macro-average for the 90 languages included. The effect is most
significant for low-resourced languages with a drop as high as 95 points, but
even high-resourced languages lose about 10 points on average. Our results
clearly show that generalizing inflection to unseen lemmas is far from being
solved, presenting a simple yet effective means to promote more sophisticated
models.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been
devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.</span>

                                        <span>Fine-tuned language models use greedy decoding to answer reading
comprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not
ensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee
that it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse
than an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the
performance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a
decoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the
context. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on
zero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples
are available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.
However, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of
exact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more
extractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the
training set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the
model towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot
setting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest
that pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question
answering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the
greedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Scientific silos can hinder innovation. These information &quot;filter bubbles&quot;
and the growing challenge of information overload limit awareness across the
literature, making it difficult to keep track of even narrow areas of interest,
let alone discover new ones. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which
often prioritize relevance, can further reinforce these bubbles. In response,
we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their
work, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We
construct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from
their papers and inferred personas. We explore approaches both for recommending
new content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to
understand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with
computer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users&#x27;
abilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and
contrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather
than aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover
authors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work,
at a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model. Our analysis reveals that
Bridger connects authors who have different citation profiles, publish in
different venues, and are more distant in social co-authorship networks,
raising the prospect of bridging diverse communities and facilitating
discovery.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to
document ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general
language model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific
fine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would
model relevance from a user-system dualism: the user&#x27;s view and the system&#x27;s
view. User&#x27;s view judges the relevance based on the activities of &quot;real users&quot;
while the system&#x27;s view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,
e.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system
relevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper
we propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user&#x27;s
view and system&#x27;s view into consideration, under the pre-training and
fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user&#x27;s view of relevance,
Pre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on
large-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system&#x27;s
view of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled
relevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are
fine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and
deep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by
incorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users
and the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two
implementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,
respectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks
showed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively
outperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art
performances.</span>

deterministic methods, which generate a unique description given an input
graph. However, the generation problem admits a range of acceptable textual
outputs, exhibiting lexical, syntactic and semantic variation. To address this
disconnect, we present two main contributions. First, we propose a stochastic
graph-to-text model, incorporating a latent variable in an encoder-decoder
model, and its use in an ensemble. Second, to assess the diversity of the
generated sentences, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric which jointly
evaluates output diversity and quality in a multi-reference setting. We
evaluate the models on WebNLG datasets in English and Russian, and show an
ensemble of stochastic models produces diverse sets of generated sentences,
while retaining similar quality to state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using fine-tuned language
models~(LM) for dense retrieval. However, dense retrievers are hard to train,
typically requiring heavily engineered fine-tuning pipelines to realize their
full potential. In this paper, we identify and address two underlying problems
of dense retrievers: i)~fragility to training data noise and ii)~requiring
large batches to robustly learn the embedding space. We use the recently
proposed Condenser pre-training architecture, which learns to condense
information into the dense vector through LM pre-training. On top of it, we
propose coCondenser, which adds an unsupervised corpus-level contrastive loss
to warm up the passage embedding space. Retrieval experiments on MS-MARCO,
Natural Question, and Trivia QA datasets show that coCondenser removes the need
for heavy data engineering such as augmentation, synthesis, or filtering, as
well as the need for large batch training. It shows comparable performance to
RocketQA, a state-of-the-art, heavily engineered system, using simple small
batch fine-tuning.</span>

success in almost every NLP task. The evolution of these models started with
GPT and BERT. These models are built on the top of transformers,
self-supervised learning and transfer learning. Transformed-based PTLMs learn
universal language representations from large volumes of text data using
self-supervised learning and transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. These
models provide good background knowledge to downstream tasks which avoids
training of downstream models from scratch. In this comprehensive survey paper,
we initially give a brief overview of self-supervised learning. Next, we
explain various core concepts like pretraining, pretraining methods,
pretraining tasks, embeddings and downstream adaptation methods. Next, we
present a new taxonomy of T-PTLMs and then give brief overview of various
benchmarks including both intrinsic and extrinsic. We present a summary of
various useful libraries to work with T-PTLMs. Finally, we highlight some of
the future research directions which will further improve these models. We
strongly believe that this comprehensive survey paper will serve as a good
reference to learn the core concepts as well as to stay updated with the recent
happenings in T-PTLMs.</span>

embeddings, and their output is a ranking. In this paper, we focus on ranking
algorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking
applicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both
white box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their
location in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the
similarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then
uses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We
tested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from
Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on
average the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF
is more successful compared to USE.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel approach for estimating depth from a monocular camera as
it moves through complex and crowded indoor environments, e.g., a department
store or a metro station. Our approach predicts absolute scale depth maps over
the entire scene consisting of a static background and multiple moving people,
by training on dynamic scenes. Since it is difficult to collect dense depth
maps from crowded indoor environments, we design our training framework without
requiring depths produced from depth sensing devices. Our network leverages RGB
images and sparse depth maps generated from traditional 3D reconstruction
methods to estimate dense depth maps. We use two constraints to handle depth
for non-rigidly moving people without tracking their motion explicitly. We
demonstrate that our approach offers consistent improvements over recent depth
estimation methods on the NAVERLABS dataset, which includes complex and crowded
scenes.</span>

                                        <span>Lymphoma detection and segmentation from whole-body Positron Emission
Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) volumes are crucial for surgical
indication and radiotherapy. Designing automatic segmentation methods capable
of effectively exploiting the information from PET and CT as well as resolving
their uncertainty remain a challenge. In this paper, we propose an lymphoma
segmentation model using an UNet with an evidential PET/CT fusion layer.
Single-modality volumes are trained separately to get initial segmentation maps
and an evidential fusion layer is proposed to fuse the two pieces of evidence
using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). Moreover, a multi-task loss function is
proposed: in addition to the use of the Dice loss for PET and CT segmentation,
a loss function based on the concordance between the two segmentation is added
to constrain the final segmentation. We evaluate our proposal on a database of
polycentric PET/CT volumes of patients treated for lymphoma, delineated by the
experts. Our method get accurate segmentation results with Dice score of 0.726,
without any user interaction. Quantitative results show that our method is
superior to the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Recent methods for visual question answering rely on large-scale annotated
datasets. Manual annotation of questions and answers for videos, however, is
tedious, expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we propose to avoid
manual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video
question answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage
a question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate
question-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,
we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M
video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse
answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive
loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer
transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent
results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,
ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. Finally, for a detailed evaluation we introduce
iVQA, a new VideoQA dataset with reduced language biases and high-quality
redundant manual annotations. Our code, datasets and trained models are

similarity measure between the baseline tasks and the incoming target task. We
first define the notion of task similarity based on the log-determinant of the
Fisher Information Matrices. Next, we compute the task similarity from each of
the baseline tasks to the incoming target task. By utilizing the relation
between a target and a set of learned baseline tasks, the search space of
architectures for the incoming target task can be significantly reduced, making
the discovery of the best candidates in the set of possible architectures
tractable and efficient, in terms of GPU days. This method eliminates the
requirement for training the networks from scratch for the incoming target task
as well as introducing the bias in the initialization of the search space from
the human domain. Experimental results with 8 classification tasks in MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets illustrate the efficacy of our proposed approach and its
competitiveness with other state-of-art methods in terms of the classification
performance, the number of parameters, and the search time.</span>

success in recent years. However, these models didn&#x27;t consider the
personalization issue of segmentation though it is important in practice. In
this paper, we address the problem of personalized image segmentation. The
objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled

Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem
and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the
correlation among a user&#x27;s personalized images, we propose a baseline method
that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on

for the first time that a single network can represent scene geometry over time
continually without catastrophic forgetting, while achieving promising

through time-consuming schemes. This diminishes the detectors&#x27; speed, thereby
becoming the computational bottleneck in advanced oriented object detection
systems. This work proposes an effective and simple oriented object detection
framework, termed Oriented R-CNN, which is a general two-stage oriented
detector with promising accuracy and efficiency. To be specific, in the first
stage, we propose an oriented Region Proposal Network (oriented RPN) that
directly generates high-quality oriented proposals in a nearly cost-free
manner. The second stage is oriented R-CNN head for refining oriented Regions
of Interest (oriented RoIs) and recognizing them. Without tricks, oriented
R-CNN with ResNet50 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy on two
commonly-used datasets for oriented object detection including DOTA (75.87%
mAP) and HRSC2016 (96.50% mAP), while having a speed of 15.1 FPS with the image
size of 1024$\times$1024 on a single RTX 2080Ti. We hope our work could inspire
rethinking the design of oriented detectors and serve as a baseline for
oriented object detection. Code is available at

much of the growth being driven by objectives that are hard to quantitatively
compare. These techniques include colorization, cyclical consistency, and
noise-contrastive estimation from image patches. Consequently, the field has
settled on a handful of measurements that depend on linear probes to adjudicate
which approaches are the best. Our first contribution is to show that this test
is insufficient and that models which perform poorly (strongly) on linear
classification can perform strongly (weakly) on more involved tasks like
temporal activity localization. Our second contribution is to analyze the
capabilities of five different representations. And our third contribution is a
much needed new dataset for temporal activity localization.</span>

                                        <span>Multiview detection incorporates multiple camera views to deal with
occlusions, and its central problem is multiview aggregation. Given feature map
projections from multiple views onto a common ground plane, the
state-of-the-art method addresses this problem via convolution, which applies
the same calculation regardless of object locations. However, such
translation-invariant behaviors might not be the best choice, as object
features undergo various projection distortions according to their positions
and cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel multiview detector, MVDeTr, that
adopts a newly introduced shadow transformer to aggregate multiview
information. Unlike convolutions, shadow transformer attends differently at
different positions and cameras to deal with various shadow-like distortions.
We propose an effective training scheme that includes a new view-coherent data
augmentation method, which applies random augmentations while maintaining
multiview consistency. On two multiview detection benchmarks, we report new
state-of-the-art accuracy with the proposed system. Code is available at

network from its architecture encoding. It can effectively assist in designing
networks and improving Neural Architecture Search(NAS) efficiency. However, a
high-performance predictor depends on adequate trainning samples, which
requires unaffordable computation overhead. To alleviate this problem, we
propose a novel framework to train an accuracy predictor under few training

inject noise to feature space. The ensemble learning algorithm, termed cascade

                                        <span>Video objection detection is a challenging task because isolated video frames
may encounter appearance deterioration, which introduces great confusion for
detection. One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information
and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from
neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing
methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation
rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature
representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named
TF-Blender,which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation mod-els the
relations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve
spatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of
every neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the
first two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks.
For its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection
network to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID
and YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using
TF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods.</span>

COVID-19. Due to the high sensitivity of Computed Tomography (CT) to this
disease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the
forefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are
frequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.
This is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is
the mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the
literature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different
published results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to
analyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with
CT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model
training sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is
frequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even
in the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back
to inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more
realistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We
hope that our reproducible investigation will help in curbing hype-driven
claims for the critical problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pave the way for a
more transparent performance evaluation of techniques for CT-based COVID-19

                                        <span>3D single object tracking is a key issue for autonomous following robot,
where the robot should robustly track and accurately localize the target for
efficient following. In this paper, we propose a 3D tracking method called
3D-SiamRPN Network to track a single target object by using raw 3D point cloud
data. The proposed network consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork is
feature embedding subnetwork which is used for point cloud feature extraction
and fusion. In this subnetwork, we first use PointNet++ to extract features of
point cloud from template and search branches. Then, to fuse the information of
features in the two branches and obtain their similarity, we propose two cross
correlation modules, named Pointcloud-wise and Point-wise respectively. The
second subnetwork is region proposal network(RPN), which is used to get the
final 3D bounding box of the target object based on the fusion feature from
cross correlation modules. In this subnetwork, we utilize the regression and
classification branches of a region proposal subnetwork to obtain proposals and
scores, thus get the final 3D bounding box of the target object. Experimental
results on KITTI dataset show that our method has a competitive performance in
both Success and Precision compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and could
run in real-time at 20.8 FPS. Additionally, experimental results on H3D dataset
demonstrate that our method also has good generalization ability and could
achieve good tracking performance in a new scene without re-training.</span>

                                        <span>The physical and clinical constraints surrounding diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to
8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information
contained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in
higher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging
hinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible
images. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for
the direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation
distribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration
of the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike
standard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.
Furthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error
(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than
23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when
compared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the
resulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber
bundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%
difference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to
generate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than
15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely
relying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between
the high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.</span>

type of deep neural network mainly based on the self-attention mechanism.
Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at
ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual
benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other
types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Given its high
performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, transformer is
receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this
paper, we review these vision transformer models by categorizing them in
different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main
categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision,
low-level vision, and video processing. We also include efficient transformer
methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications.
Furthermore, we also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in
computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Toward the end of
this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research
directions for vision transformers.</span>

                                        <span>A number of deep learning based algorithms have been proposed to recover
high-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones. Among them, some restore
the missing details of each frame via exploring the spatiotemporal information
of neighboring frames. However, these methods usually suffer from a narrow
temporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the
neighboring ones. In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we
propose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within
a long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference
frames and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal
compensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective
Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay
more effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a
moving object. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the
existing ones on the MFQE 2.0 dataset in terms of both fidelity and perceptual
effect. Code is available at https://github.com/zhaominyiz/RFDA-PyTorch.</span>

                                        <span>Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match
cross-modality pedestrian images, breaking through the limitation of
single-modality person ReID in dark environment. In order to mitigate the
impact of large modality discrepancy, existing works manually design various
two-stream architectures to separately learn modality-specific and
modality-sharable representations. Such a manual design routine, however,
highly depends on massive experiments and empirical practice, which is time
consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we systematically study the
manually designed architectures, and identify that appropriately separating
Batch Normalization (BN) layers is the key to bring a great boost towards
cross-modality matching. Based on this observation, the essential objective is
to find the optimal separation scheme for each BN layer. To this end, we
propose a novel method, named Cross-Modality Neural Architecture Search
(CM-NAS). It consists of a BN-oriented search space in which the standard
optimization can be fulfilled subject to the cross-modality task. Equipped with
the searched architecture, our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts
in both two benchmarks, improving the Rank-1/mAP by 6.70%/6.13% on SYSU-MM01
and by 12.17%/11.23% on RegDB. Code is released at

                                        <span>Useful information (UI) is an elusive concept in neural networks. A
quantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be
recognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps
decreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training
due to lower Nyquist frequency. Inspired by the low-Nyqusit-frequency nature of
UI, we propose the use of spectral roll-off points (SROPs) to estimate UI on
variations. The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D
image by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP
statistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information
estimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI
variations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and
training stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in
various randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP
variations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes
the explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain
knowledge.</span>

of low power consumption, high dynamic range, and high response speed for
visual perception and understanding on portable devices. Event-based learning
methods have recently achieved massive success on object recognition by
integrating events into dense frame-based representations to apply traditional
2D learning algorithms. However, these approaches introduce much redundant
information during the sparse-to-dense conversion and necessitate models with
heavy-weight and large capacities, limiting the potential of event cameras on
real-life applications. To address the core problem of balancing accuracy and
model complexity for event-based classification models, we (1) construct graph
representations for event data to utilize their sparsity nature better and
design a lightweight end-to-end graph neural network (EV-VGCNN) for
classification; (2) use voxel-wise vertices rather than traditional point-wise
methods to incorporate the information from more points; (3) introduce a
multi-scale feature relational layer (MFRL) to extract semantic and motion cues
from each vertex adaptively concerning its distances to neighbors.
Comprehensive experiments show that our approach advances state-of-the-art
classification accuracy while achieving nearly 20 times parameter reduction

identifying dogs on roads) is crucial in safety-critical applications. Existing
approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require
additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an
extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or
lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of
a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among
classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,
the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly
different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying
unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we
propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in
order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of
max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions
from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels
share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our
method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training,
which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation
models. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art

for visual grounding, namely TransVG, to address the task of grounding a
language query to the corresponding region onto an image. The state-of-the-art
methods, including two-stage or one-stage ones, rely on a complex module with
manually-designed mechanisms to perform the query reasoning and multi-modal
fusion. However, the involvement of certain mechanisms in fusion module design,
such as query decomposition and image scene graph, makes the models easily
overfit to datasets with specific scenarios, and limits the plenitudinous
interaction between the visual-linguistic context. To avoid this caveat, we
propose to establish the multi-modal correspondence by leveraging transformers,
and empirically show that the complex fusion modules (\eg, modular attention
network, dynamic graph, and multi-modal tree) can be replaced by a simple stack
of transformer encoder layers with higher performance. Moreover, we
re-formulate the visual grounding as a direct coordinates regression problem
and avoid making predictions out of a set of candidates (\emph{i.e.}, region
proposals or anchor boxes). Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely
used datasets, and a series of state-of-the-art records are set by our TransVG.

                                        <span>Human-designed data augmentation strategies have been replaced by
automatically learned augmentation policy in the past two years. Specifically,
recent work has empirically shown that the superior performance of the
automated data augmentation methods stems from increasing the diversity of
augmented data \cite{autoaug, randaug}. However, two factors regarding the
diversity of augmented data are still missing: 1) the explicit definition (and
thus measurement) of diversity and 2) the quantifiable relationship between
diversity and its regularization effects. To bridge this gap, we propose a
diversity measure called Variance Diversity and theoretically show that the
regularization effect of data augmentation is promised by Variance Diversity.
We validate in experiments that the relative gain from automated data
augmentation in test accuracy is highly correlated to Variance Diversity. An
unsupervised sampling-based framework, \textbf{DivAug}, is designed to directly
maximize Variance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization effect.
Without requiring a separate search process, the performance gain from DivAug
is comparable with the state-of-the-art method with better efficiency.
Moreover, under the semi-supervised setting, our framework can further improve
the performance of semi-supervised learning algorithms compared to RandAugment,
making it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is
scarce. The code is available at

known correspondences. Our first contribution is to show that this primitive
alignment framework unifies five perception problems including point cloud
registration, primitive (mesh) registration, category-level 3D registration,
absolution pose estimation (APE), and category-level APE. Our second
contribution is to propose DynAMical Pose estimation (DAMP), the first general

rigid body dynamics arising from virtual springs and damping, where the springs
span the shortest distances between corresponding primitives. We evaluate DAMP
in simulated and real datasets across all five problems, and demonstrate (i)
DAMP always converges to the globally optimal solution in the first three
problems with 3D-3D correspondences; (ii) although DAMP sometimes converges to
suboptimal solutions in the last two problems with 2D-3D correspondences, using
a scheme for escaping local minima, DAMP always succeeds. Our third
contribution is to demystify the surprising empirical performance of DAMP and
formally prove a global convergence result in the case of point cloud
registration by charactering local stability of the equilibrium points of the
underlying dynamical system.</span>

degradation at extremely low computational cost (e.g. 5M FLOPs on ImageNet
classification). We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic
activation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids
the significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the
detriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose
micro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low
rank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also
present a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve
the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input
feature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new
operators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves
significant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime.
For instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4\% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6\%. Source

                                        <span>Domain adaptation (DA) paves the way for label annotation and dataset bias
issues by the knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a related
but unlabeled target domain. A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature
distributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the
entire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy
background, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case
will negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead
to the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant
semantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain
Adaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most
principal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction
distributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize
the prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the
model to find the region with large differences among the same class of
samples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that
discrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same
class of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts. As a general
method, SCDA can be easily integrated into various DA methods as a regularizer
to further boost their performance. Extensive experiments on the cross-domain
benchmarks show the efficacy of SCDA.</span>

first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been disclosed. In this
work, we further bridge the deep neural architecture design with the
second-order ODEs and propose a novel reversible neural network, termed as
m-RevNet, that is characterized by inserting momentum update to residual
blocks. The reversible property allows us to perform backward pass without
access to activation values of the forward pass, greatly relieving the storage
burden during training. Furthermore, the theoretical foundation based on
second-order ODEs grants m-RevNet with stronger representational power than
vanilla residual networks, which potentially explains its performance gains.
For certain learning scenarios, we analytically and empirically reveal that our
m-RevNet succeeds while standard ResNet fails. Comprehensive experiments on
various image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of our m-RevNet over ResNet, concerning both memory efficiency
and recognition performance.</span>

results in many image retrieval tasks. However, their invariance to target data
is pre-defined by the network architecture and training data. Existing image
retrieval approaches require fine-tuning or modification of pre-trained
networks to adapt to variations unique to the target data. In contrast, our
method enhances the invariance of off-the-shelf features by aggregating
features extracted from images augmented at test-time, with augmentations
guided by a policy learned through reinforcement learning. The learned policy
assigns different magnitudes and weights to the selected transformations, which
are selected from a list of image transformations. Policies are evaluated using
a metric learning protocol to learn the optimal policy. The model converges
quickly and the cost of each policy iteration is minimal as we propose an
off-line caching technique to greatly reduce the computational cost of
extracting features from augmented images. Experimental results on large

                                        <span>How do the neural networks distinguish two images? It is of critical
importance to understand the matching mechanism of deep models for developing
reliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as
surveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning
methods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the
spatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we
present a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent
embedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on
feature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that
explicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow
between feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn
metrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be
decomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the
overall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to
off-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our
method on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,
Cars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements
over popular metric learning methods with better interpretability. Code is

semantically meaningful visual representations by solving pretext tasks.
However, prior work in SSL focuses on tasks like object recognition or
detection, which aim to learn object shapes and assume that the features should
be invariant to concepts like colors and textures. Thus, these SSL methods
perform poorly on downstream tasks where these concepts provide critical
information. In this paper, we present an SSL framework that enables us to
learn color and texture-aware features without requiring any labels during
training. Our approach consists of three self-supervised tasks designed to
capture different concepts that are neglected in prior work that we can select
from depending on the needs of our downstream tasks. Our tasks include learning
to predict color histograms and discriminate shapeless local patches and
textures from each instance. We evaluate our approach on fashion compatibility
using Polyvore Outfits and In-Shop Clothing Retrieval using Deepfashion,
improving upon prior SSL methods by 9.5-16%, and even outperforming some
supervised approaches on Polyvore Outfits despite using no labels. We also show

                                        <span>Anomaly detection methods require high-quality features. In recent years, the
anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using
advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very
promising direction, using pretrained deep features, has been mostly
overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,
but unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly
detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,
state-of-the-art methods.

In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt
pretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning
methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the
one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out
that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised
learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and
reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates
using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance
gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early
stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic
regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms
the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation
settings by large margins.</span>

                                        <span>Retrieving occlusion relation among objects in a single image is challenging
due to sparsity of boundaries in image. We observe two key issues in existing
works: firstly, lack of an architecture which can exploit the limited amount of
coupling in the decoder stage between the two subtasks, namely occlusion
boundary extraction and occlusion orientation prediction, and secondly,
improper representation of occlusion orientation. In this paper, we propose a
novel architecture called Occlusion-shared and Path-separated Network (OPNet),
which solves the first issue by exploiting rich occlusion cues in shared
high-level features and structured spatial information in task-specific
low-level features. We then design a simple but effective orthogonal occlusion
representation (OOR) to tackle the second issue. Our method surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by 6.1%/8.3% Boundary-AP and 6.5%/10% Orientation-AP
on standard PIOD/BSDS ownership datasets. Code is available at

games like Starcraft II and in real-world environments where the entire

visual information, agents must choose where to look and how to optimally use
their limited visual information in order to succeed at the game. We verify
that with a relatively simple model the agent can learn where to look in
scenarios with a limited visual bandwidth. We develop a method for masking part
of the environment in Atari games to force the RL agent to learn both where to
look and how to play the game in order to study where the RL agent learns to

allowing the agent to choose where to look and what action to take in the Pong

                                        <span>Large-scale pretraining of visual representations has led to state-of-the-art
performance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of
these techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been
relatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery
product, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from
use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to
general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for
retrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a
billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the
performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to
replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system
and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this
backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised
image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of
clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.
Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that
large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to
industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production
visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%
improvement in click-through volume. We conduct extensive experiments to better
understand the empirical relationships between Transformer-based architectures,
dataset scale, and the performance of production vision systems.</span>

                                        <span>The combination of the traditional convolutional network (i.e., an
auto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention
in clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature
and the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.
However, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to
adaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative
representation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at
different layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior
clustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method
named Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN
exploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node
attribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a
scale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features
embedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN
can jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised
fashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more
flexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and
discriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the
clustering results. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on commonly
used benchmark datasets validate that our AGCN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

well-optimized teacher network to a smaller learnable student network.Existing
KD methods have mainly considered two types of knowledge, namely the individual
knowledge and the relational knowledge. However, these two types of knowledge
are usually modeled independently while the inherent correlations between them
are largely ignored. It is critical for sufficient student network learning to
integrate both individual knowledge and relational knowledge while reserving
their inherent correlation. In this paper, we propose to distill the novel
holistic knowledge based on an attributed graph constructed among instances.
The holistic knowledge is represented as a unified graph-based embedding by
aggregating individual knowledge from relational neighborhood samples with
graph neural networks, the student network is learned by distilling the
holistic knowledge in a contrastive manner. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted on benchmark datasets, the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The code has been published in

learning to bridge the gap between computer vision and robot learning. We
design a platform with: (i) a simulation system for complex dexterous
manipulation tasks with a multi-finger robot hand and (ii) a computer vision
system to record large-scale demonstrations of a human hand conducting the same
tasks. In our new pipeline, we extract 3D hand and object poses from the
videos, and convert them to robot demonstrations via motion retargeting. We
then apply and compare multiple imitation learning algorithms with the
demonstrations. We show that the demonstrations can indeed improve robot
learning by a large margin and solve the complex tasks which reinforcement
learning alone cannot solve. Project page with video:

create opportunities for greater edge intelligence. In the domain of vision,
the ability to adapt a Convolutional Neural Network&#x27;s (CNN) structure and
parameters to the input data distribution leads to systems with lower memory
footprint, latency and power consumption. However, due to the limited compute
resources and memory budget on edge devices, it is necessary for the system to
be able to predict the latency and memory footprint of the training process in
order to identify favourable training configurations of the network topology
and device combination for efficient network adaptation. This work proposes
perf4sight, an automated methodology for developing accurate models that
predict CNN training memory footprint and latency given a target device and
network. This enables rapid identification of network topologies that can be
retrained on the edge device with low resource consumption. With PyTorch as the
framework and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as the target device, the developed models
predict training memory footprint and latency with 95% and 91% accuracy
respectively for a wide range of networks, opening the path towards efficient
network adaptation on edge GPUs.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been
actively studied to mitigate the domain gap between label-rich source data and
unlabeled target data. Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to
reach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only
if Required strategy, LabOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to
adaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In
order to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the
proposed adaptive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to
achieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%)
ground truth points, which we call &quot;Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL)&quot;. To
further reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose &quot;Point-based
Pixel-Labeling (PPL)&quot;, which finds the most representative points for labeling
within the generated inconsistency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment
label to 40 points label while minimizing performance degradation. Through
extensive experimentation, we show the advantages of this new framework for
domain adaptive semantic segmentation while minimizing human labor costs.</span>

automated 3D reconstructions of the world&#x27;s landmarks from tourist photos.
However, a major source of information available for these 3D-augmented

untapped. In this work, we present WikiScenes, a new, large-scale dataset of

vision and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Even with significant progress in
the last few years, automatic gaze analysis still remains challenging due to
the individuality of eyes, eye-head interplay, occlusion, image quality, and
illumination conditions. There are several open questions including what are
the important cues to interpret gaze direction in an unconstrained environment
without prior knowledge and how to encode them in real-time. We review the
progress across a range of gaze analysis tasks and applications to shed light
on these fundamental questions; identify effective methods in gaze analysis and
provide possible future directions. We analyze recent gaze estimation and
segmentation methods, especially in the unsupervised and weakly supervised
domain, based on their advantages and reported evaluation metrics. Our analysis
shows that the development of a robust and generic gaze analysis method still
needs to address real-world challenges such as unconstrained setup and learning
with less supervision. We conclude by discussing future research directions for
designing a real-world gaze analysis system that can propagate to other domains

is crucial to model both motion patterns and diversity in the action video.
This paper proposes an Action Conditional Temporal Variational AutoEncoder

ACT-VAE predicts pose sequences for an action clips from a single input image.
It is implemented as a deep generative model that maintains temporal coherence
according to the action category with a novel temporal modeling on latent
space. Further, ACT-VAE is a general action sequence prediction framework. When
connected with a plug-and-play Pose-to-Image (P2I) network, ACT-VAE can
synthesize image sequences. Extensive experiments bear out our approach can
predict accurate pose and synthesize realistic image sequences, surpassing
state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to existing methods, ACT-VAE improves

                                        <span>The lensless pinhole camera is perhaps the earliest and simplest form of an
imaging system using only a pinhole-sized aperture in place of a lens. They can
capture an infinite depth-of-field and offer greater freedom from optical
distortion over their lens-based counterparts. However, the inherent
limitations of a pinhole system result in lower sharpness from blur caused by
optical diffraction and higher noise levels due to low light throughput of the
small aperture, requiring very long exposure times to capture well-exposed
images. In this paper, we explore an image restoration pipeline using deep
learning and domain-knowledge of the pinhole system to enhance the pinhole
image quality through a joint denoise and deblur approach. Our approach allows
for more practical exposure times for hand-held photography and provides higher
image quality, making it more suitable for daily photography compared to other
lensless cameras while keeping size and cost low. This opens up the potential
of pinhole cameras to be used in smaller devices, such as smartphones.</span>

                                        <span>With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing
large neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained
devices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression
methodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy
consumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such
methodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge
captured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to
various reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the
compression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing
research problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we
point out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be
observed in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample
generation strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch
between the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we
propose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of
generated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching
the real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum
information gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy
of the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art
approaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.</span>

towards the training of machine learning and computer vision models. The first
dataset encompasses as the day of writing over 1.2 million images of
indoor-grown crops and weeds common to the Canadian Prairies and many US
states. The second dataset consists of over 540,000 images of plants imaged in
farmland. All indoor plant images are labelled by species and we provide rich
etadata on the level of individual images. This comprehensive database allows
to filter the datasets under user-defined specifications such as for example
the crop-type or the age of the plant. Furthermore, the indoor dataset contains
images of plants taken from a wide variety of angles, including profile shots,
top-down shots, and angled perspectives. The images taken from plants in fields
are all from a top-down perspective and contain usually multiple plants per
image. For these images metadata is also available. In this paper we describe
both datasets&#x27; characteristics with respect to plant variety, plant age, and
number of images. We further introduce an open-access sample of the
indoor-dataset that contains 1,000 images of each species covered in our
dataset. These, in total 14,000 images, had been selected, such that they form
a representative sample with respect to plant age and ndividual plants per
species. This sample serves as a quick entry point for new users to the
dataset, allowing them to explore the data on a small scale and find the
parameters of data most useful for their application without having to deal
with hundreds of thousands of individual images.</span>

                                        <span>Despite recent advancements in single-domain or single-object image
generation, it is still challenging to generate complex scenes containing
diverse, multiple objects and their interactions. Scene graphs, composed of
nodes as objects and directed-edges as relationships among objects, offer an
alternative representation of a scene that is more semantically grounded than
images. We hypothesize that a generative model for scene graphs might be able
to learn the underlying semantic structure of real-world scenes more
effectively than images, and hence, generate realistic novel scenes in the form
of scene graphs. In this work, we explore a new task for the unconditional
generation of semantic scene graphs. We develop a deep auto-regressive model
called SceneGraphGen which can directly learn the probability distribution over
labelled and directed graphs using a hierarchical recurrent architecture. The
model takes a seed object as input and generates a scene graph in a sequence of
steps, each step generating an object node, followed by a sequence of
relationship edges connecting to the previous nodes. We show that the scene
graphs generated by SceneGraphGen are diverse and follow the semantic patterns
of real-world scenes. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the
generated graphs in image synthesis, anomaly detection and scene graph
completion.</span>

exciting results in novel view synthesis from a single image. Despite realistic
results, methods are limited to relatively small view change. In order to
synthesize immersive scenes, models must also be able to extrapolate. We
present an approach that fuses 3D reasoning with autoregressive modeling to
outpaint large view changes in a 3D-consistent manner, enabling scene
synthesis. We demonstrate considerable improvement in single image large-angle

including face swapping and face reenactment. However, these methods are
confined to dealing with one specific task at a time. In addition, for video
facial editing, previous methods either simply apply transformations frame by
frame or utilize multiple frames in a concatenated or iterative fashion, which
leads to noticeable visual flickers. In this paper, we propose a unified
temporally consistent facial video editing framework termed UniFaceGAN. Based
on a 3D reconstruction model and a simple yet efficient dynamic training sample
selection mechanism, our framework is designed to handle face swapping and face
reenactment simultaneously. To enforce the temporal consistency, a novel 3D
temporal loss constraint is introduced based on the barycentric coordinate
interpolation. Besides, we propose a region-aware conditional normalization
layer to replace the traditional AdaIN or SPADE to synthesize more
context-harmonious results. Compared with the state-of-the-art facial image
editing methods, our framework generates video portraits that are more
photo-realistic and temporally smooth.</span>

environments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior
knowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state
transitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of
reinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value
Iteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert
demonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two
major limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current
differentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high
branching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to
obstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the
network are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently
large penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural
constraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any
impossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited
perspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real
robot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view
without rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map
to aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational
dynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our
proposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several
2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging
for this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully
perform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,
consisting of real images captured from a robot.</span>

find that it is hard to determine the polynomial order of the fitting surface
and the fitting surface is sensitive to outliers. To address these problems, we
propose a simple yet effective solution that adds an additional offset
prediction to improve the quality of normal estimation. Furthermore, in order
to take advantage of points from different neighborhood sizes, a novel Cascaded
Scale Aggregation layer is proposed to help the network predict more accurate
point-wise offsets and weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaFit
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the synthetic PCPNet dataset and
the real-word SceneNN dataset.</span>

and jointly map an environment, thus paving the way to wide-ranging
applications of multi-robot perception and multi-user AR experiences by
eliminating the need for external infrastructure or pre-built maps. This
article presents COVINS, a novel collaborative SLAM system, that enables
multi-agent, scalable SLAM in large environments and for large teams of more
than 10 agents. The paradigm here is that each agent runs visual-inertial
odomety independently onboard in order to ensure its autonomy, while sharing
map information with the COVINS server back-end running on a powerful local PC
or a remote cloud server. The server back-end establishes an accurate
collaborative global estimate from the contributed data, refining the joint
estimate by means of place recognition, global optimization and removal of
redundant data, in order to ensure an accurate, but also efficient SLAM
process. A thorough evaluation of COVINS reveals increased accuracy of the
collaborative SLAM estimates, as well as efficiency in both removing redundant
information and reducing the coordination overhead, and demonstrates successful
operation in a large-scale mission with 12 agents jointly performing SLAM.</span>

designing. However, the weight-sharing technique worsens the ranking

Specifically, we carefully redesign the sub-networks in the supernet and map
the original supernet to a new one of high capacity. In addition, we gradually
add narrow branches of supernet to reduce the degree of weight sharing which
effectively alleviates the mutual interference between sub-networks. Finally,

facial geometry from a single image in an unsupervised manner. Inspired by
classical techniques of coarse-to-fine optimization and recent advances in
implicit neural representations of 3D shape, SIDER combines a geometry prior
based on statistical models and Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) to recover
facial details from single images. First, it estimates a coarse geometry using
a morphable model represented as an SDF. Next, it reconstructs facial geometry
details by optimizing a photometric loss with respect to the ground truth
image. In contrast to prior work, SIDER does not rely on any dataset priors and
does not require additional supervision from multiple views, lighting changes
or ground truth 3D shape. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art on facial geometric

                                        <span>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a widely researched tool for
neural architecture search, due to its promising results for image
classification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through
the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture
search. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of
inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a
controlled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be
extended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield
three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,
the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final
performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And
third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training
does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we
conclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from
several runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the
correlation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)
carefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs
of hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.</span>

works showed that utilization of extracted image features and a spatially

computation time, and cause memory consumption to increase. In this work, we

from single RGB images. To tackle such a severely ill-posed problem, we propose
a physically-interpretable, compact, efficient, and end-to-end learning-based
framework, namely AGD-Net. Precisely, by taking advantage of the imaging
process, we first formulate the problem explicitly based on the classic
gradient descent algorithm. Then, we design a lightweight neural network with a
multi-stage architecture to mimic the formed amended gradient descent process,
in which efficient convolution and novel spectral zero-mean normalization are
proposed to effectively extract spatial-spectral features for regressing an
initialization, a basic gradient, and an incremental gradient. Besides, based
on the approximate low-rank property of HS images, we propose a novel rank loss
to promote the similarity between the global structures of reconstructed and
ground-truth HS images, which is optimized with our singular value weighting
strategy during training. Moreover, AGD-Net, a single network after one-time
training, is flexible to handle the reconstruction with various spectral
response functions. Extensive experiments over three commonly-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that AGD-Net can improve the reconstruction quality by
more than 1.0 dB on average while saving 67$\times$ parameters and 32$\times$
FLOPs, compared with state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly

This paper proposes a Multi-IlluStrator Style Generative Adversarial Network

preserving images. The illustrations dataset is a challenging one since it is
comprised of illustrations of seven different illustrators, hence contains
diverse styles. Existing methods require to train several generators (as the
number of illustrators) to handle the different illustrators&#x27; styles, which
limits their practical usage, or require to train an image specific network,
which ignores the style information provided in other images of the

model parameters directly from depth images without the need to know
articulation model categories a priori. By contrast, existing methods that
learn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point
estimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe
manipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel
representation for distributions over rigid body transformations and
articulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher
distributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an
efficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the
constraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.
Leveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based
approach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model
estimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach
on several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its
performance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate
that DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for
novel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point
estimates with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively
capture the uncertainty over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs.</span>

problem and a wavefront set extraction problem in tomographic imaging. The
algorithm is based on a recently developed digital wavefront set extractor as
well as the well-known microlocal canonical relation for the Radon transform.
We use the wavefront set information about x-ray data to improve the
reconstruction by requiring that the underlying neural networks simultaneously
extract the correct ground truth wavefront set and ground truth image. As a
necessary theoretical step, we identify the digital microlocal canonical
relations for deep convolutional residual neural networks. We find strong

a popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without
appropriately tuned $\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have
the tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing
training loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity
(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is
typically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in
making the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from
weights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a
method called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be
stacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by
constraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.
Empirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a
deep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization
performance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While
LAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all
optimizers when used with large batch sizes</span>

actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Currently, most
state-of-the-art WSTAL methods follow a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline:
producing snippet-level predictions first and then aggregating to the
video-level prediction. However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked
two important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the
incompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we
analyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary
informative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion
prior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to
model motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In
addition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is
proposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores.
Extensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models
action-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results.
Besides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is
applicable with existing WSTAL methods. Without loss of generality, based on
the standard MIL pipeline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance
on three challenging benchmarks, including THUMOS&#x27;14, ActivityNet v1.2 and
v1.3.</span>

                                        <span>Visual affordance grounding aims to segment all possible interaction regions
between people and objects from an image/video, which is beneficial for many
applications, such as robot grasping and action recognition. However, existing
methods mainly rely on the appearance feature of the objects to segment each
region of the image, which face the following two problems: (i) there are
multiple possible regions in an object that people interact with; and (ii)
there are multiple possible human interactions in the same object region. To
address these problems, we propose a Hand-aided Affordance Grounding Network
(HAGNet) that leverages the aided clues provided by the position and action of
the hand in demonstration videos to eliminate the multiple possibilities and
better locate the interaction regions in the object. Specifically, HAG-Net has
a dual-branch structure to process the demonstration video and object image.
For the video branch, we introduce hand-aided attention to enhance the region
around the hand in each video frame and then use the LSTM network to aggregate
the action features. For the object branch, we introduce a semantic enhancement
module (SEM) to make the network focus on different parts of the object
according to the action classes and utilize a distillation loss to align the
output features of the object branch with that of the video branch and transfer
the knowledge in the video branch to the object branch. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on two challenging datasets show that our method has
achieved stateof-the-art results for affordance grounding. The source code will
be made available to the public.</span>

                                        <span>Recognizing and localizing objects in the 3D space is a crucial ability for
an AI agent to perceive its surrounding environment. While significant progress
has been achieved with expensive LiDAR point clouds, it poses a great challenge
for 3D object detection given only a monocular image. While there exist
different alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are
either equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or
empirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With
in-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in
inaccurate object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight approach, dubbed Progressive Coordinate Transforms (PCT) to
facilitate learning coordinate representations. Specifically, a localization
boosting mechanism with confidence-aware loss is introduced to progressively
refine the localization prediction. In addition, semantic image repre-
sentation is also exploited to compensate for the usage of patch proposals.
Despite being lightweight and simple, our strategy leads to superior
improvements on the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset monocular 3D detection
benchmarks. At the same time, our proposed PCT shows great generalization to
most coordinate- based 3D detection frameworks. The code is available at:

Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) at Stanford University - the first
robotic testbed capable of validating machine learning algorithms for
spaceborne optical navigation. The TRON facility consists of two 6
degrees-of-freedom KUKA robot arms and a set of Vicon motion track cameras to
reconfigure an arbitrary relative pose between a camera and a target mockup
model. The facility includes multiple Earth albedo light boxes and a sun lamp
to recreate the high-fidelity spaceborne illumination conditions. After the
overview of the facility, this work details the multi-source calibration
procedure which enables the estimation of the relative pose between the object
and the camera with millimeter-level position and millidegree-level orientation
accuracies. Finally, a comparative analysis of the synthetic and TRON simulated
imageries is performed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained
on the synthetic images. The result shows a considerable gap in the CNN&#x27;s
performance, suggesting the TRON simulated images can be used to validate the
robustness of any machine learning algorithms trained on more easily accessible

to rely on shortcut opportunities (SO) in the form of predictive and
easy-to-represent visual factors. This is known as shortcut learning and leads
to impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer
from shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of
variation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides
shortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent
part of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between
predicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to
exploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce
the Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and
metrics to study a network&#x27;s shortcut vulnerability and generalization
capability for six independent FoV. In particular, DiagViB-6 allows controlling
the type and degree of SO and GO in a dataset. We benchmark a wide range of
popular vision architectures and show that they can exploit GO only to a

                                        <span>To accommodate rapid changes in the real world, the cognition system of
humans is capable of continually learning concepts. On the contrary,
conventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously
learned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its
performance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many
recent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing
advanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,
the benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under
multi-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving
and new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance
of regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for
subsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance
decay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable
incremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method
adaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At
the same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited
number of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves up to 6.0% performance
improvement by increasing the number of parameters by just 1.2% for each newly
learned task.</span>

likely inherit the dataset&#x27;s bias information. As a result, the obtained model
would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life
applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target
task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly
extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation
generated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the
correlation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement
plays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a
cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint
content and local structural representation learning to boost mutual
information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments
on publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

recognition task of identifying which action a man is actually doing.
Extracting the keypoint information of a single human with both spatial and
temporal features of action sequences plays an essential role to accomplish the
task.In this paper, we propose a human action system for Red-Green-Blue(RGB)
input video with our own designed module. Based on the efficient Gated
Recurrent Unit(GRU) for spatio-temporal feature extraction, we add another
sampling module and normalization module to improve the performance of the
model in order to recognize the human actions. Furthermore, we build a novel
dataset with a similar background and discriminative actions for both human
keypoint prediction and behavior recognition. To get a better result, we
retrain the pose model with our new dataset to get better performance.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on our

which is based on the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, in the

the meta-training and dense labels in the meta-test, thus making the model
learn to predict dense labels from sparse ones. We conducted experiments with
four Chest X-Ray datasets to evaluate two types of annotations (grid and
points). The results show that our method is the most suitable when the target
domain highly differs from source domains, achieving Jaccard scores comparable
to dense labels, using less than 2% of the pixels of an image with labels in

                                        <span>With the availability of many datasets tailored for autonomous driving in
real-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes
achieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road,
unstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing
segmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot
overcome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.
In this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed
to overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant
representations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder
embedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically
designed to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are
significant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation
networks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is
used in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative
representations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so
that it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the
Robot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are
collected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental
results show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of
existing segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects
over various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent
computational cost and network parameters. As the proposed method can be
integrated into compact networks, it presents a viable approach for
resource-limited small autonomous platforms.</span>

for immersive visual effects and VR/AR experience. Recent neural advances still
lack the controllable and interactive bullet-time design ability for human
free-viewpoint rendering, especially under the real-time, dynamic and general
setting for our trajectory-aware task. To fill this gap, in this paper we
propose a neural interactive bullet-time generator (iButter) for
photo-realistic human free-viewpoint rendering from dense RGB streams, which
enables flexible and interactive design for human bullet-time visual effects.
Our iButter approach consists of a real-time preview and design stage as well
as a trajectory-aware refinement stage. During preview, we propose an
interactive bullet-time design approach by extending the NeRF rendering to a
real-time and dynamic setting and getting rid of the tedious per-scene
training. To this end, our bullet-time design stage utilizes a hybrid training
set, light-weight network design and an efficient silhouette-based sampling
strategy. During refinement, we introduce an efficient trajectory-aware scheme
within 20 minutes, which jointly encodes the spatial, temporal consistency and
semantic cues along the designed trajectory, achieving photo-realistic
bullet-time viewing experience of human activities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for convenient interactive
bullet-time design and photo-realistic human free-viewpoint video generation.</span>

                                        <span>In clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with multiple
contrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different properties
of the same region of interest in human body. The whole acquisition process can
be accelerated by having one or more modalities under-sampled in the k-space.
Recent researches demonstrate that, considering the redundancy between
different contrasts or modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in the
k-space can be better reconstructed with the helps from a fully-sampled
sequence (i.e., the reference modality). It implies that, in the same study of
the same subject, multiple sequences can be utilized together toward the
purpose of highly efficient multi-modal reconstruction. However, we find that
multi-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle spatial
misalignment between different sequences, which is actually common in clinical
practice. In this paper, we integrate the spatial alignment network with
reconstruction, to improve the quality of the reconstructed target modality.
Specifically, the spatial alignment network estimates the spatial misalignment
between the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target images, and
warps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned fully-sampled
reference image joins the under-sampled target image in the reconstruction
network, to produce the high-quality target image. Considering the contrast
difference between the target and the reference, we particularly design the
cross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss, in combination with the
reconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the
reconstruction network. Our experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil
k-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our spatial
alignment network. Code is publicly available at

resulting in an increasingly unsustainable crop water demand from reduced
freshwater availability. Achieving food security while deploying water in a
sustainable manner will continue to be a major challenge necessitating careful
monitoring and tracking of agricultural water usage. Historically, monitoring
water usage has been a slow and expensive manual process with many
imperfections and abuses. Ma-chine learning and remote sensing developments
have increased the ability to automatically monitor irrigation patterns, but
existing techniques often require curated and labelled irrigation data, which
are expensive and time consuming to obtain and may not exist for impactful
areas such as developing countries. In this paper, we explore an end-to-end
real world application of irrigation detection with uncurated and unlabeled
satellite imagery. We apply state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning
techniques to optical remote sensing data, and find that we are able to detect
irrigation with up to nine times better precision, 90% better recall and 40%
more generalization ability than the traditional supervised learning methods.</span>

                                        <span>Brain aging, and more specifically the difference between the chronological
and the biological age of a person, may be a promising biomarker for
identifying neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose accurate prediction is
important but the localisation of the areas that play a significant role in the
prediction is also crucial, in order to gain clinicians&#x27; trust and reassurance
about the performance of a prediction model. Most interpretability methods are
focused on classification tasks and cannot be directly transferred to
regression tasks. In this study, we focus on the task of brain age regression
from 3D brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using a Convolutional Neural
Network, termed prediction model. We interpret its predictions by extracting
importance maps, which discover the parts of the brain that are the most
important for brain age. In order to do so, we assume that voxels that are not
useful for the regression are resilient to noise addition. We implement a noise
model which aims to add as much noise as possible to the input without harming
the performance of the prediction model. We average the importance maps of the
subjects and end up with a population-based importance map, which displays the
regions of the brain that are influential for the task. We test our method on
13,750 3D brain MR images from the UK Biobank, and our findings are consistent
with the existing neuropathology literature, highlighting that the hippocampus
and the ventricles are the most relevant regions for brain aging.</span>

human-computer interaction applications, convolution neural networks (CNNs)
based estimation models have been actively explored. However, the existing
models require complex architectures or redundant computational resources to
trade with the acceptable accuracy. To tackle this limitation, this paper
proposes HandFoldingNet, an accurate and efficient hand pose estimator that
regresses the hand joint locations from the normalized 3D hand point cloud
input. The proposed model utilizes a folding-based decoder that folds a given
2D hand skeleton into the corresponding joint coordinates. For higher
estimation accuracy, folding is guided by multi-scale features, which include
both global and joint-wise local features. Experimental results show that the
proposed model outperforms the existing methods on three hand pose benchmark
datasets with the lowest model parameter requirement. Code is available at

                                        <span>In this work, we address the challenging task of referring segmentation. The
query expression in referring segmentation typically indicates the target
object by describing its relationship with others. Therefore, to find the
target one among all instances in the image, the model must have a holistic
understanding of the whole image. To achieve this, we reformulate referring
segmentation as a direct attention problem: finding the region in the image
where the query language expression is most attended to. We introduce
transformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder
attention mechanism architecture that &quot;queries&quot; the given image with the
language expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which
produces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that
represent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from
different aspects. At the same time, to find the best way from these
diversified comprehensions based on visual clues, we further propose a Query
Balance Module to adaptively select the output features of these queries for a
better mask generation. Without bells and whistles, our approach is
light-weight and achieves new state-of-the-art performance consistently on
three referring segmentation datasets, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref. Our code

                                        <span>Using publicly available data to determine the performance of methodological
contributions is important as it facilitates reproducibility and allows
scrutiny of the published results. In lung nodule classification, for example,
many works report results on the publicly available LIDC dataset. In theory,
this should allow a direct comparison of the performance of proposed methods
and assess the impact of individual contributions. When analyzing seven recent
works, however, we find that each employs a different data selection process,
leading to largely varying total number of samples and ratios between benign
and malignant cases. As each subset will have different characteristics with
varying difficulty for classification, a direct comparison between the proposed
methods is thus not always possible, nor fair. We study the particular effect
of truthing when aggregating labels from multiple experts. We show that
specific choices can have severe impact on the data distribution where it may
be possible to achieve superior performance on one sample distribution but not
on another. While we show that we can further improve on the state-of-the-art
on one sample selection, we also find that on a more challenging sample
selection, on the same database, the more advanced models underperform with
respect to very simple baseline methods, highlighting that the selected data
distribution may play an even more important role than the model architecture.
This raises concerns about the validity of claimed methodological
contributions. We believe the community should be aware of these pitfalls and
make recommendations on how these can be avoided in future work.</span>

                                        <span>Open-set semi-supervised learning (open-set SSL) investigates a challenging
but practical scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are contained in
the unlabeled data. While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter
out the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel
training mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for
enhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We
achieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all
the unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.
Specifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to
obtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to
more discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the
OOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal
matching strategy to detect OOD samples. Instead of directly applying binary
classification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is
matched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed
cross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a
compatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task.
Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially lifts the
performance on open-set SSL and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large
margin.</span>

                                        <span>Ground segmentation is crucial for terrestrial mobile platforms to perform
navigation or neighboring object recognition. Unfortunately, the ground is not
flat, as it features steep slopes; bumpy roads; or objects, such as curbs,
flower beds, and so forth. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel
ground segmentation method called \textit{Patchwork}, which is robust for
addressing the under-segmentation problem and operates at more than 40 Hz. In
this paper, a point cloud is encoded into a Concentric Zone Model-based
representation to assign an appropriate density of cloud points among bins in a
way that is not computationally complex. This is followed by Region-wise Ground
Plane Fitting, which is performed to estimate the partial ground for each bin.
Finally, Ground Likelihood Estimation is introduced to dramatically reduce
false positives. As experimentally verified on SemanticKITTI and rough terrain
datasets, our proposed method yields promising performance compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, showing faster speed compared with existing plane
fitting--based methods. Code is available:

                                        <span>Recommender systems aim to provide personalized services to users and are
playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The key of
recommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items
based on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,
purchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing
efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite
graph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,
these GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the
recommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based
recommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable
behaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,
which can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we
investigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)
of existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we
propose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled
designs that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions.
Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and
understand the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our implementation and
datasets can be released after publication.</span>

provides information on a specific product or item listing. Just below the
details of the item on this page, the buyer can usually find recommendations
for other relevant items. These are typically in the form of a series of
modules or carousels, with each module containing a set of recommended items.
The selection and ordering of these item recommendation modules are intended to
increase discover-ability of relevant items and encourage greater user
engagement, while simultaneously showcasing diversity of inventory and
satisfying other business objectives. Item recommendation modules on the IDP
are often curated and statically configured for all customers, ignoring
opportunities for personalization. In this paper, we present a scalable
end-to-end production system to optimize the personalized selection and
ordering of item recommendation modules on the IDP in real-time by utilizing
deep neural networks. Through extensive offline experimentation and online A/B
testing, we show that our proposed system achieves significantly higher
click-through and conversion rates compared to other existing methods. In our
online A/B test, our framework improved click-through rate by 2.48% and
purchase-through rate by 7.34% over a static configuration.</span>

                                        <span>Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using fine-tuned language
models~(LM) for dense retrieval. However, dense retrievers are hard to train,
typically requiring heavily engineered fine-tuning pipelines to realize their
full potential. In this paper, we identify and address two underlying problems
of dense retrievers: i)~fragility to training data noise and ii)~requiring
large batches to robustly learn the embedding space. We use the recently
proposed Condenser pre-training architecture, which learns to condense
information into the dense vector through LM pre-training. On top of it, we
propose coCondenser, which adds an unsupervised corpus-level contrastive loss
to warm up the passage embedding space. Retrieval experiments on MS-MARCO,
Natural Question, and Trivia QA datasets show that coCondenser removes the need
for heavy data engineering such as augmentation, synthesis, or filtering, as
well as the need for large batch training. It shows comparable performance to
RocketQA, a state-of-the-art, heavily engineered system, using simple small
batch fine-tuning.</span>

page are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A
search ranking system typically orders the results by independent
query-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such
unilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that
users are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in
practice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require
enforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business
objectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results
does not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a
slate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the
optimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to
slate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework
extended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate
optimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization
(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as
well as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The
proposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as
enforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top
results and personalization of results. Experiments on public datasets and
real-world data from e-commerce datasets show that CSSO outperforms popular
comparable ranking methods in terms of adherence to distributional criteria
while producing comparable or better relevance metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Scientific silos can hinder innovation. These information &quot;filter bubbles&quot;
and the growing challenge of information overload limit awareness across the
literature, making it difficult to keep track of even narrow areas of interest,
let alone discover new ones. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which
often prioritize relevance, can further reinforce these bubbles. In response,
we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their
work, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We
construct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from
their papers and inferred personas. We explore approaches both for recommending
new content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to
understand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with
computer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users&#x27;
abilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and
contrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather
than aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover
authors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work,
at a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model. Our analysis reveals that
Bridger connects authors who have different citation profiles, publish in
different venues, and are more distant in social co-authorship networks,
raising the prospect of bridging diverse communities and facilitating
discovery.</span>

                                        <span>Proper initialization is crucial to the optimization and the generalization
of neural networks. However, most existing neural recommendation systems
initialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a
new initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian
Eigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).
LEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale
neighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive
regularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the
data distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be
computed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural
recommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the
simple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation
systems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often
perform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the
initialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)
network, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both
traditional and state-of-the-art neural recommender systems.</span>

privacy (DP) using a general metric, has been widely studied to provide
rigorous privacy guarantees while keeping high utility. However, existing works
on extended DP are limited to few metrics, such as the Euclidean metric.
Consequently, they have only a small number of applications, such as
location-based services and document processing. In this paper, we propose a
couple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular
distance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive
hashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for
personal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy
properties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking
into account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately. We
apply our mechanisms to friend matching based on high-dimensional personal data
with angular distance in the local model, and evaluate our mechanisms using two
real datasets. We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that
RAPPOR does not work in this application. Then we show that our mechanisms
enable friend matching with high utility and rigorous privacy guarantees based
on extended DP.</span>

user&#x27;s next click according to the previous session sequence. The current
studies generally learn user preferences according to the transitions of items
in the user&#x27;s session sequence. However, other effective information in the
session sequence, such as user profiles, are largely ignored which may lead to
the model unable to learn the user&#x27;s specific preferences. In this paper, we
propose a heterogeneous graph neural network-based session recommendation
method, named SR-HetGNN, which can learn session embeddings by heterogeneous
graph neural network (HetGNN), and capture the specific preferences of
anonymous users. Specifically, SR-HetGNN first constructs heterogeneous graphs
containing various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can
capture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN
captures the complex transitions between items and learns the item embeddings
containing user information. Finally, to consider the influence of users&#x27; long
and short-term preferences, local and global session embeddings are combined
with the attentional network to obtain the final session embedding. SR-HetGNN
is shown to be superior to the existing state-of-the-art session-based

trade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user&#x27;s preferences for
short-term satisfaction and exploring additional user preferences for long-term
coverage. Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a
recommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease
user satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration
frequently mismatch with the user&#x27;s interests. To mitigate this risk,
recommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a
recommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback
on the items to discover the user&#x27;s additional tastes. This mix-in approach has
been widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating
the effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for
eliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to
propose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and
compare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To
this end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for
exploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our
results indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen
for exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new
interface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,
diversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show
that, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric
evaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,

                                        <span>Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to
document ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general
language model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific
fine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would
model relevance from a user-system dualism: the user&#x27;s view and the system&#x27;s
view. User&#x27;s view judges the relevance based on the activities of &quot;real users&quot;
while the system&#x27;s view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,
e.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system
relevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper
we propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user&#x27;s
view and system&#x27;s view into consideration, under the pre-training and
fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user&#x27;s view of relevance,
Pre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on
large-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system&#x27;s
view of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled
relevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are
fine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and
deep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by
incorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users
and the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two
implementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,
respectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks
showed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively
outperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art
performances.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been
devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.</span>

We use the wavefront set information about x-ray data to improve the
reconstruction by requiring that the underlying neural networks simultaneously
extract the correct ground truth wavefront set and ground truth image. As a

                                        <span>This paper aims at addressing the problem of substantial performance
degradation at extremely low computational cost (e.g. 5M FLOPs on ImageNet
classification). We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic
activation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids
the significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the
detriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose
micro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low
rank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also
present a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve
the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input
feature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new
operators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves
significant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime.
For instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4\% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6\%. Source

reliability of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. To address this,
lexically constrained NMT explores various methods to ensure pre-specified
words and phrases appear in the translation output. However, in many cases,
those methods are studied on general domain corpora, where the terms are mostly
uni- and bi-grams (&gt;98%). In this paper, we instead tackle a more challenging
setup consisting of domain-specific corpora with much longer n-gram and highly
specialized terms. Inspired by the recent success of masked span prediction
models, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that achieves
consistent improvements on both terminology and sentence-level translation for

                                        <span>We introduce the first application of the lean methodology to machine
learning projects. Similar to lean startups and lean manufacturing, we argue
that lean machine learning (LeanML) can drastically slash avoidable wastes in
commercial machine learning projects, reduce the business risk in investing in
machine learning capabilities and, in so doing, further democratize access to
machine learning. The lean design pattern we propose in this paper is based on
two realizations. First, it is possible to estimate the best performance one
may achieve when predicting an outcome $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ using a given set of
explanatory variables $x \in \mathcal{X}$, for a wide range of performance
metrics, and without training any predictive model. Second, doing so is
considerably easier, faster, and cheaper than learning the best predictive
model. We derive formulae expressing the best $R^2$, MSE, classification
accuracy, and log-likelihood per observation achievable when using $x$ to
predict $y$ as a function of the mutual information $I\left(y; x\right)$, and
possibly a measure of the variability of $y$ (e.g. its Shannon entropy in the
case of classification accuracy, and its variance in the case regression MSE).
We illustrate the efficacy of the LeanML design pattern on a wide range of
regression and classification problems, synthetic and real-life.</span>

                                        <span>In the face of compounding crises of social and economic inequality, many
have turned to algorithmic decision-making to achieve greater fairness in
society. As these efforts intensify, reasoning within the burgeoning field of
&quot;algorithmic fairness&quot; increasingly shapes how fairness manifests in practice.
This paper interrogates whether algorithmic fairness provides the appropriate
conceptual and practical tools for enhancing social equality. I argue that the
dominant, &quot;formal&quot; approach to algorithmic fairness is ill-equipped as a
framework for pursuing equality, as its narrow frame of analysis generates
restrictive approaches to reform. In light of these shortcomings, I propose an
alternative: a &quot;substantive&quot; approach to algorithmic fairness that centers
opposition to social hierarchies and provides a more expansive analysis of how
to address inequality. This substantive approach enables more fruitful
theorizing about the role of algorithms in combatting oppression. The
distinction between formal and substantive algorithmic fairness is exemplified
by each approach&#x27;s responses to the &quot;impossibility of fairness&quot; (an
incompatibility between mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness).
While the formal approach requires us to accept the &quot;impossibility of fairness&quot;
as a harsh limit on efforts to enhance equality, the substantive approach
allows us to escape the &quot;impossibility of fairness&quot; by suggesting reforms that
are not subject to this false dilemma and that are better equipped to
ameliorate conditions of social oppression.</span>

                                        <span>Multiplex networks have become increasingly more prevalent in many fields,
and have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real
networks. There is a critical need for developing inference models for
multiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across
different layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a
limited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for
community detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the
ability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast,
many existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our
model automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer
(as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the
number of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and
especially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change
across layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a
hierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing
dependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block
model (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler
for sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the
link probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique
challenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the
hierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical
validation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior
performance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability
to uncover interesting structures in real networks.</span>

                                        <span>Anomaly detection methods require high-quality features. In recent years, the
anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using
advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very
promising direction, using pretrained deep features, has been mostly
overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,
but unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly
detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,
state-of-the-art methods.

In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt
pretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning
methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the
one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out
that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised
learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and
reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates
using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance
gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early
stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic
regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms
the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation
settings by large margins.</span>

model parameters directly from depth images without the need to know
articulation model categories a priori. By contrast, existing methods that
learn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point
estimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe
manipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel
representation for distributions over rigid body transformations and
articulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher
distributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an
efficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the
constraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.
Leveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based
approach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model
estimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach
on several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its
performance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate
that DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for
novel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point
estimates with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively
capture the uncertainty over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs.</span>

privacy and computation challenges. FL ensures no data leaves its source as the
model is trained at where the data resides. However, FL comes with its own set
of challenges. The communication of model weight updates in this distributed
environment comes with significant network bandwidth costs. In this context, we
propose a mechanism of compressing the weight updates using Autoencoders (AE),
which learn the data features of the weight updates and subsequently perform
compression. The encoder is set up on each of the nodes where the training is
performed while the decoder is set up on the node where the weights are
aggregated. This setup achieves compression through the encoder and recreates
the weights at the end of every communication round using the decoder. This
paper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression
technique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large
scale FL, as it not only achieves compression ratios ranging from 500x to 1720x
and beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements,
computational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.</span>

                                        <span>All learning algorithms for recommendations face inevitable and critical
trade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user&#x27;s preferences for
short-term satisfaction and exploring additional user preferences for long-term
coverage. Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a
recommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease
user satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration
frequently mismatch with the user&#x27;s interests. To mitigate this risk,
recommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a
recommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback
on the items to discover the user&#x27;s additional tastes. This mix-in approach has
been widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating
the effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for
eliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to
propose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and
compare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To
this end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for
exploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our
results indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen
for exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new
interface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,
diversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show
that, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric
evaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,
which utilizes learning algorithm based on users&#x27; feedback signals, giving
better user experience and gathering more feedback data.</span>

                                        <span>Continuous engineering of autonomous driving functions commonly requires
deploying vehicles in road testing to obtain inputs that cause problematic
decisions. Although the discovery leads to producing an improved system, it
also challenges the foundation of testing using equivalence classes and the
associated relative test coverage criterion. In this paper, we propose believed
equivalence, where the establishment of an equivalence class is initially based
on expert belief and is subject to a set of available test cases having a
consistent valuation. Upon a newly encountered test case that breaks the
consistency, one may need to refine the established categorization in order to
split the originally believed equivalence into two. Finally, we focus on
modules implemented using deep neural networks where every category partitions
an input over the real domain. We present both analytical and lazy methods to
suggest the refinement. The concept is demonstrated in analyzing multiple
autonomous driving modules, indicating the potential of our proposed approach.</span>

speech with gestures. Although many data-driven approaches to gesture
generation have been proposed in recent years, it is still unclear whether such
systems can consistently generate gestures that convey meaning. We investigate
which gesture properties (phase, category, and semantics) can be predicted from
speech text and/or audio using contemporary deep learning. In extensive
experiments, we show that gesture properties related to gesture meaning
(semantics and category) are predictable from text features (time-aligned BERT
embeddings) alone, but not from prosodic audio features, while rhythm-related
gesture properties (phase) on the other hand can be predicted from either
audio, text (with word-level timing information), or both. These results are
encouraging as they indicate that it is possible to equip an embodied agent
with content-wise meaningful co-speech gestures using a machine-learning model.</span>

                                        <span>Proper initialization is crucial to the optimization and the generalization
of neural networks. However, most existing neural recommendation systems
initialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a
new initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian
Eigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).
LEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale
neighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive
regularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the
data distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be
computed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural
recommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the
simple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation
systems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often
perform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the
initialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)
network, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both
traditional and state-of-the-art neural recommender systems.</span>

reinforcement learning, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding in
designing controllers that provide robustness to inherent non-asymptotic
uncertainties arising from models estimated with finite, noisy data. We propose
a robust adaptive control algorithm that explicitly incorporates such
non-asymptotic uncertainties into the control design. The algorithm has three
components: (1) a least-squares nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap
resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model
estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control design method using an
optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with multiplicative noise. A key
advantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification and robust
control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations, so
that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns
with the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against. We show
through numerical experiments that the proposed robust adaptive controller can
significantly outperform the certainty equivalent controller on both expected
regret and measures of regret risk.</span>

large, structured action spaces such as the [0,1] interval, where similar
actions are guaranteed to have similar rewards. A central theme here is the
adaptive discretization of the action space, which gradually &#x60;&#x60;zooms in&#x27;&#x27; on
the more promising regions thereof. The goal is to take advantage of &#x60;&#x60;nicer&#x27;&#x27;
problem instances, while retaining near-optimal worst-case performance. While
the stochastic version of the problem is well-understood, the general version
with adversarial rewards is not. We provide the first algorithm for adaptive
discretization in the adversarial version, and derive instance-dependent regret
bounds. In particular, we recover the worst-case optimal regret bound for the
adversarial version, and the instance-dependent regret bound for the stochastic
version. Further, an application of our algorithm to dynamic pricing (where a
seller repeatedly adjusts prices for a product) enjoys these regret bounds
without any smoothness assumptions.</span>

of dynamic pricing (DP) on E-commerce platform using methods based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). By using four groups of different business data
to represent the states of each time period, we model the dynamic pricing
problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Compared with the state-of-the-art
DRL-based dynamic pricing algorithms, our approaches make the following three
contributions. First, we extend the discrete set problem to the continuous
price set. Second, instead of using revenue as the reward function directly, we
define a new function named difference of revenue conversion rates (DRCR).
Third, the cold-start problem of MDP is tackled by pre-training and evaluation
using some carefully chosen historical sales data. Our approaches are evaluated
by both offline evaluation method using real dataset of Alibaba Inc., and
online field experiments starting from July 2018 with thousands of items,
lasting for months on Tmall.com. To our knowledge, there is no other DP field
experiment using DRL before. Field experiment results suggest that DRCR is a
more appropriate reward function than revenue, which is widely used by current
literature. Also, continuous price sets have better performance than discrete
sets and our approaches significantly outperformed the manual pricing by
operation experts.</span>

                                        <span>The construction of multiclass classifiers from binary elements is studied in
this paper, and performance is quantified by the regret, defined with respect
to the Bayes optimal log-loss. We discuss two known methods. The first is one
vs. all (OVA), for which we prove that the multiclass regret is upper bounded
by the sum of binary regrets of the constituent classifiers. The second is
hierarchical classification, based on a binary tree. For this method we prove
that the multiclass regret is exactly a weighted sum of constituent binary
regrets where the weighing is determined by the tree structure.

We also introduce a leverage-hierarchical classification method, which
potentially yields smaller log-loss and regret. The advantages of these
classification methods are demonstrated by simulation on both synthetic and
real-life datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) play an increasingly important role in various
computer systems. In order to create these networks, engineers typically
specify a desired topology, and then use an automated training algorithm to
select the network&#x27;s weights. While training algorithms have been studied
extensively and are well understood, the selection of topology remains a form
of art, and can often result in networks that are unnecessarily large - and
consequently are incompatible with end devices that have limited memory,
battery or computational power. Here, we propose to address this challenge by
harnessing recent advances in DNN verification. We present a framework and a
methodology for discovering redundancies in DNNs - i.e., for finding neurons
that are not needed, and can be removed in order to reduce the size of the DNN.
By using sound verification techniques, we can formally guarantee that our
simplified network is equivalent to the original, either completely, or up to a
prescribed tolerance. Further, we show how to combine our technique with
slicing, which results in a family of very small DNNs, which are together
equivalent to the original. Our approach can produce DNNs that are
significantly smaller than the original, rendering them suitable for deployment
on additional kinds of systems, and even more amenable to subsequent formal
verification. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach, and
use it to evaluate our techniques on several real-world DNNs.</span>

                                        <span>Motion sensors embedded in wearable and mobile devices allow for dynamic
selection of sensor streams and sampling rates, enabling several applications,
such as power management and data-sharing control. While deep neural networks
(DNNs) achieve competitive accuracy in sensor data classification, DNNs
generally process incoming data from a fixed set of sensors with a fixed
sampling rate, and changes in the dimensions of their inputs cause considerable
accuracy loss, unnecessary computations, or failure in operation. We introduce
a dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes DNNs flexible and more
robust to changes in sensor availability and in sampling rate. DAP operates on
convolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed
dimensions suitable for feedforward and recurrent layers. We also propose a
dimension-adaptive training (DAT) procedure for enabling DNNs that use DAP to
better generalize over the set of feasible data dimensions at inference time.
DAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and
optimization with accumulated gradients of several backward passes. Combining
DAP and DAT, we show how to transform non-adaptive DNNs into a
Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture (DANA), while keeping the same number of
parameters. Compared to existing approaches, our solution provides better
classification accuracy over the range of possible data dimensions at inference
time and does not require up-sampling or imputation, thus reducing unnecessary
computations. Experiments on seven datasets (four benchmark real-world datasets
for human activity recognition and three synthetic datasets) show that DANA
prevents significant losses in classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art
DNNs and, compared to baselines, it better captures correlated patterns in
sensor data under dynamic sensor availability and varying sampling rates.</span>

attracts much attention in recent years. It exploits acoustic transceivers such
as microphones and speakers beyond their primary functions, namely recording
and playing, to enable novel applications and new user experiences. In this
paper, we present the first systematic survey of recent advances in active
acoustic sensing using commodity hardware with a frequency range below
24~\!kHz. We propose a general framework that categorizes main building blocks
of acoustic sensing systems. This framework encompasses three layers, i.e.,
physical layer, core technique layer, and application layer. The physical layer
includes basic hardware components, acoustic platforms as well as the air-borne
and structure-borne channel characteristics. The core technique layer
encompasses key mechanisms to generate acoustic signals (waveforms) and to
extract useful temporal, spatial and spectral information from received
signals. The application layer builds upon the functions offered by the core
techniques to realize different acoustic sensing applications. We highlight
unique challenges due to the limitations of physical devices and acoustic
channels and how they are mitigated or overcame by core processing techniques
and application-specific solutions. Finally, research opportunities and future
directions are discussed to spawn further in-depth investigation on acoustic
sensing.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in multi-fingered robotic grasping have enabled fast
6-Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) single object grasping. Multi-finger grasping in
cluttered scenes, on the other hand, remains mostly unexplored due to the added
difficulty of reasoning over obstacles which greatly increases the
computational time to generate high-quality collision-free grasps. In this work
we address such limitations by introducing DDGC, a fast generative multi-finger
grasp sampling method that can generate high quality grasps in cluttered scenes
from a single RGB-D image. DDGC is built as a network that encodes scene
information to produce coarse-to-fine collision-free grasp poses and
configurations. We experimentally benchmark DDGC against the
simulated-annealing planner in GraspIt! on 1200 simulated cluttered scenes and
7 real world scenes. The results show that DDGC outperforms the baseline on
synthesizing high-quality grasps and removing clutter while being 5 times
faster. This, in turn, opens up the door for using multi-finger grasps in
practical applications which has so far been limited due to the excessive
computation time needed by other methods.</span>

model while still maintaining data privacy, without needing access to data
stored locally at the clients. However, FL suffers performance degradation when
client data distribution is non-IID, and a longer training duration to combat
this degradation may not necessarily be feasible due to communication
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a new adaptive training
algorithm $\texttt{AdaFL}$, which comprises two components: (i) an
attention-based client selection mechanism for a fairer training scheme among
the clients; and (ii) a dynamic fraction method to balance the trade-off
between performance stability and communication efficiency. Experimental
results show that our $\texttt{AdaFL}$ algorithm outperforms the usual

empirical success, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This paper builds
the mathematical framework to approximate cooperative MARL by a mean-field
control (MFC) approach, and shows that the approximation error is of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. By establishing an appropriate form of the
dynamic programming principle for both the value function and the Q function,
it proposes a model-free kernel-based Q-learning algorithm (MFC-K-Q), which is
shown to have a linear convergence rate for the MFC problem, the first of its
kind in the MARL literature. It further establishes that the convergence rate
and the sample complexity of MFC-K-Q are independent of the number of agents
$N$, which provides an $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ approximation to the
MARL problem with $N$ agents in the learning environment. Empirical studies for
the network traffic congestion problem demonstrate that MFC-K-Q outperforms
existing MARL algorithms when $N$ is large, for instance when $N&gt;50$.</span>

                                        <span>The physical and clinical constraints surrounding diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to
8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information
contained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in
higher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging
hinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible
images. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for
the direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation
distribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration
of the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike
standard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.
Furthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error
(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than
23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when
compared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the
resulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber
bundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%
difference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to
generate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than
15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely
relying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between
the high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.</span>

                                        <span>We discuss the approximation of the value function for infinite-horizon
discounted Markov Reward Processes (MRP) with nonlinear functions trained with
the Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We first consider this problem
under a certain scaling of the approximating function, leading to a regime
called lazy training. In this regime, the parameters of the model vary only
slightly during the learning process, a feature that has recently been observed
in the training of neural networks, where the scaling we study arises
naturally, implicit in the initialization of their parameters. Both in the
under- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence to
local, respectively global minimizers of the above algorithm in the lazy
training regime. We then compare this scaling of the parameters to the
mean-field regime, where the approximately linear behavior of the model is
lost. Under this alternative scaling we prove that all fixed points of the
dynamics in parameter space are global minimizers. We finally give examples of
our convergence results in the case of models that diverge if trained with
non-lazy TD learning, and in the case of neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>Representation learning for speech emotion recognition is challenging due to
labeled data sparsity issue and lack of gold standard references. In addition,
there is much variability from input speech signals, human subjective
perception of the signals and emotion label ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a machine learning framework to obtain speech emotion representations
by limiting the effect of speaker variability in the speech signals.
Specifically, we propose to disentangle the speaker characteristics from
emotion through an adversarial training network in order to better represent
emotion. Our method combines the gradient reversal technique with an entropy
loss function to remove such speaker information. Our approach is evaluated on
both IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets. We show that our method improves speech
emotion classification and increases generalization to unseen speakers.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning accelerators efficiently train over vast and growing amounts of
data, placing a newfound burden on commodity networks and storage devices. A
common approach to conserve bandwidth involves resizing or compressing data
prior to training. We introduce Progressive Compressed Records (PCRs), a data
format that uses compression to reduce the overhead of fetching and
transporting data, effectively reducing the training time required to achieve a
target accuracy. PCRs deviate from previous storage formats by combining
progressive compression with an efficient storage layout to view a single
dataset at multiple fidelities---all without adding to the total dataset size.
We implement PCRs and evaluate them on a range of datasets, training tasks, and
hardware architectures. Our work shows that: (i) the amount of compression a
dataset can tolerate exceeds 50% of the original encoding for many DL training
tasks; (ii) it is possible to automatically and efficiently select appropriate
compression levels for a given task; and (iii) PCRs enable tasks to readily
access compressed data at runtime---utilizing as little as half the training
bandwidth and thus potentially doubling training speed.</span>

sets, for example because they correspond to different sources. Stacked
penalized logistic regression (StaPLR) is a recently introduced method that can
be used for classification and automatically selecting the views that are most
important for prediction. We show how this method can easily be extended to a
setting where the data has a hierarchical multi-view structure. We apply StaPLR
to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease classification where different MRI measures have been
calculated from three scan types: structural MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and
resting-state fMRI. StaPLR can identify which scan types and which MRI measures
are most important for classification, and it outperforms elastic net
regression in classification performance.</span>

                                        <span>Reasoning about the future -- understanding how decisions in the present time
affect outcomes in the future -- is one of the central challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), especially in highly-stochastic or partially
observable environments. While predicting the future directly is hard, in this
work we introduce a method that allows an agent to &quot;look into the future&quot;
without explicitly predicting it. Namely, we propose to allow an agent, during
its training on past experience, to observe what \emph{actually} happened in
the future at that time, while enforcing an information bottleneck to avoid the
agent overly relying on this privileged information. This gives our agent the
opportunity to utilize rich and useful information about the future trajectory
dynamics in addition to the present. Our method, Policy Gradients Incorporating
the Future (PGIF), is easy to implement and versatile, being applicable to
virtually any policy gradient algorithm. We apply our proposed method to a
number of off-the-shelf RL algorithms and show that PGIF is able to achieve
higher reward faster in a variety of online and offline RL domains, as well as
sparse-reward and partially observable environments.</span>

                                        <span>Extended differential privacy, a generalization of standard differential
privacy (DP) using a general metric, has been widely studied to provide
rigorous privacy guarantees while keeping high utility. However, existing works
on extended DP are limited to few metrics, such as the Euclidean metric.
Consequently, they have only a small number of applications, such as
location-based services and document processing. In this paper, we propose a
couple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular
distance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive
hashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for
personal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy
properties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking
into account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately. We
apply our mechanisms to friend matching based on high-dimensional personal data
with angular distance in the local model, and evaluate our mechanisms using two
real datasets. We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that
RAPPOR does not work in this application. Then we show that our mechanisms
enable friend matching with high utility and rigorous privacy guarantees based
on extended DP.</span>

volume computed from input left and right images using 3D convolutions. Recent
works showed that utilization of extracted image features and a spatially
varying cost volume aggregation complements 3D convolutions. However, existing
methods with spatially varying operations are complex, cost considerable
computation time, and cause memory consumption to increase. In this work, we
construct Guided Cost volume Excitation (GCE) and show that simple channel

Moreover, we propose a novel method of using top-k selection prior to
soft-argmin disparity regression for computing the final disparity estimate.

                                        <span>We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D
environments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior
knowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state
transitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of
reinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value
Iteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert
demonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two
major limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current
differentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high
branching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to
obstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the
network are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently
large penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural
constraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any
impossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited
perspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real
robot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view
without rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map
to aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational
dynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our
proposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several
2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging
for this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully
perform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,
consisting of real images captured from a robot.</span>

                                        <span>In the fields of statistics and unsupervised machine learning a fundamental
and well-studied problem is anomaly detection. Although anomalies are difficult
to define, many algorithms have been proposed. Underlying the approaches is the
nebulous understanding that anomalies are rare, unusual or inconsistent with
the majority of data. The present work gives a philosophical approach to
clearly define anomalies and to develop an algorithm for their efficient
detection with minimal user intervention. Inspired by the Gestalt School of
Psychology and the Helmholtz principle of human perception, the idea is to
assume anomalies are observations that are unexpected to occur with respect to
certain groupings made by the majority of the data. Thus, under appropriate
random variable modelling anomalies are directly found in a set of data under a
uniform and independent random assumption of the distribution of constituent
elements of the observations; anomalies correspond to those observations where
the expectation of occurrence of the elements in a given view is $&lt;1$. Starting
from fundamental principles of human perception an unsupervised anomaly
detection algorithm is developed that is simple, real-time and parameter-free.
Experiments suggest it as the prime choice for univariate data and it shows
promising performance on the detection of global anomalies in multivariate
data.</span>

                                        <span>Useful information (UI) is an elusive concept in neural networks. A
quantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be
recognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps
decreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training
due to lower Nyquist frequency. Inspired by the low-Nyqusit-frequency nature of
UI, we propose the use of spectral roll-off points (SROPs) to estimate UI on
variations. The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D
image by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP
statistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information
estimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI
variations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and
training stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in
various randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP
variations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes
the explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain
knowledge.</span>

                                        <span>A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the
trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,
nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for
neuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate
computational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,
whereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide
a rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of
whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential
dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional
MRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of
700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the
Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and
nonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,
computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by
the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve
the best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between
accuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight
four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask
microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,
observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are
technological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are
inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with
the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our
understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of
model-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.</span>

datasets. Manual annotation of questions and answers for videos, however, is
tedious, expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we propose to avoid
manual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video
question answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage
a question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate
question-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,
we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M
video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse
answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive
loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer
transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent
results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,
ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. Finally, for a detailed evaluation we introduce
iVQA, a new VideoQA dataset with reduced language biases and high-quality
redundant manual annotations. Our code, datasets and trained models are

                                        <span>Moving towards human-like linguistic performance is often argued to require
compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
typically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of
input fragments can be guaranteed and their meanings algebraically composed.
However, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this
rigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial
compositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural
models deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we
re-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate
them for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main
issues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to
(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an
empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation
of compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing
meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.</span>

augmentation, knowledge transfer, pruning, and quantization for device-robust
acoustic scene classification (ASC). Specifically, we tackle the ASC task in a
low-resource environment leveraging a recently proposed advanced neural network
pruning mechanism, namely Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), to find a
sub-network neural model associated with a small amount non-zero model
parameters. The effectiveness of LTH for low-complexity acoustic modeling is
assessed by investigating various data augmentation and compression schemes,
and we report an efficient joint framework for low-complexity multi-device ASC,
called Acoustic Lottery. Acoustic Lottery could compress an ASC model over
$1/10^{4}$ and attain a superior performance (validation accuracy of 74.01% and
Log loss of 0.76) compared to its not compressed seed model. All results

                                        <span>Spurred by a huge interest in the post-Shannon communication, it has recently
been shown that leveraging semantics can significantly improve the
communication effectiveness across many tasks. In this article, inspired by
human communication, we propose a novel stochastic model of System 1
semantics-native communication (SNC) for generic tasks, where a speaker has an
intention of referring to an entity, extracts the semantics, and communicates
its symbolic representation to a target listener. To further reach its full
potential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the
speaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on
the physical listener&#x27;s unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication
context. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most
effective semantics for its listener. Leveraging the proposed stochastic model,
we show that the reliability of System 2 SNC increases with the number of
meaningful concepts, and derive the expected semantic representation (SR) bit
length which quantifies the extracted effective semantics. It is also shown
that System 2 SNC significantly reduces the SR length without compromising
communication reliability.</span>

a two-way bridge in between. This structure leverages the advantage of
MobileNet at local processing and transformer at global interaction. And the
bridge enables bidirectional fusion of local and global features. Different
with recent works on vision transformer, the transformer in Mobile-Former
contains very few tokens (e.g. less than 6 tokens) that are randomly
initialized, resulting in low computational cost. Combining with the proposed
light-weight cross attention to model the bridge, Mobile-Former is not only
computationally efficient, but also has more representation power,
outperforming MobileNetV3 at low FLOP regime from 25M to 500M FLOPs on ImageNet
classification. For instance, it achieves 77.9\% top-1 accuracy at 294M FLOPs,
gaining 1.3\% over MobileNetV3 but saving 17\% of computations. When
transferring to object detection, Mobile-Former outperforms MobileNetV3 by 8.6

games like Starcraft II and in real-world environments where the entire
environment is not visible. In these more complex games with more limited
visual information, agents must choose where to look and how to optimally use
their limited visual information in order to succeed at the game. We verify
that with a relatively simple model the agent can learn where to look in
scenarios with a limited visual bandwidth. We develop a method for masking part
of the environment in Atari games to force the RL agent to learn both where to
look and how to play the game in order to study where the RL agent learns to
look. In addition, we develop a neural network architecture and method for
allowing the agent to choose where to look and what action to take in the Pong

$G$ with its edges labeled as &quot;similar&quot; and &quot;dissimilar&quot; by a noisy binary
classifier. For a clustering $\mathcal{C}$ of graph $G$, a similar edge is in
disagreement with $\mathcal{C}$, if its endpoints belong to distinct clusters;
and a dissimilar edge is in disagreement with $\mathcal{C}$ if its endpoints
belong to the same cluster. The disagreements vector, $\text{dis}$, is a vector
indexed by the vertices of $G$ such that the $v$-th coordinate $\text{dis}_v$
equals the weight of all disagreeing edges incident on $v$. The goal is to
produce a clustering that minimizes the $\ell_p$ norm of the disagreements
vector for $p\geq 1$. We study the $\ell_p$ objective in Correlation Clustering
under the following assumption: Every similar edge has weight in the range of
$[\alpha\mathbf{w},\mathbf{w}]$ and every dissimilar edge has weight at least
$\alpha\mathbf{w}$ (where $\alpha \leq 1$ and $\mathbf{w}&gt;0$ is a scaling
parameter). We give an
$O\left((\frac{1}{\alpha})^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2p}}\cdot
\log\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)$ approximation algorithm for this problem.

                                        <span>The flexibility of decision boundaries in neural networks that are unguided
by training data is a well-known problem typically resolved with generalization
methods. A surprising result from recent knowledge distillation (KD) literature
is that random, untrained, and equally structured teacher networks can also
vastly improve generalization performance. It raises the possibility of
existence of undiscovered assumptions useful for generalization on an uncertain
region. In this paper, we shed light on the assumptions by analyzing decision
boundaries and confidence distributions of both simple and KD-based
generalization methods. Assuming that a decision boundary exists to represent
the most general tendency of distinction on an input sample space (i.e., the
simplest hypothesis), we show the various limitations of methods when using the
hypothesis. To resolve these limitations, we propose matured dumb teacher based
KD, conservatively transferring the hypothesis for generalization of the
student without massive destruction of trained information. In practical
experiments on feed-forward and convolution neural networks for image
classification tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, the proposed
method shows stable improvement to the best test performance in the grid search
of hyperparameters. The analysis and results imply that the proposed method can
provide finer generalization than existing methods.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) solutions are prevalent. However, many challenges exist
in making these solutions business-grade. One major challenge is to ensure that
the ML solution provides its expected business value. In order to do that, one
has to bridge the gap between the way ML model performance is measured and the
solution requirements. In previous work (Barash et al, &quot;Bridging the gap...&quot;)
we demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this
gap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a
classifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed
light on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and
therefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements. For example, the overall
accuracy of a bank text terms classifier may be very high, say $98\% \pm 2\%$,
yet it might perform poorly for terms that include short descriptions and
originate from commercial accounts. A business requirement, which may be
implicit in the training data, may be to perform well regardless of the type of
account and length of the description. Therefore, the under-performing data
slice that includes short descriptions and commercial accounts suggests
poorly-met requirements. In this paper we show the feasibility of automatically
extracting feature models that result in explainable data slices over which the
ML solution under-performs. Our novel technique, IBM FreaAI aka FreaAI,
extracts such slices from structured ML test data or any other labeled data. We
demonstrate that FreaAI can automatically produce explainable and
statistically-significant data slices over seven open datasets.</span>

conversions can delay and take place long after the clicks. The delayed
feedback poses a challenge: fresh data are beneficial to continuous training
but may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested into
the training pipeline. To balance model freshness and label certainty, previous
methods set a short waiting window or even do not wait for the conversion
signal. If conversion happens outside the waiting window, this sample will be
duplicated and ingested into the training pipeline with a positive label.
However, these methods have some issues. First, they assume the observed
feature distribution remains the same as the actual distribution. But this
assumption does not hold due to the ingestion of duplicated samples. Second,
the certainty of the conversion action only comes from the positives. But the
positives are scarce as conversions are sparse in commercial systems. These
issues induce bias during the modeling of delayed feedback. In this paper, we
propose DElayed FEedback modeling with Real negatives (DEFER) method to address
these issues. The proposed method ingests real negative samples into the
training pipeline. The ingestion of real negatives ensures the observed feature
distribution is equivalent to the actual distribution, thus reducing the bias.
The ingestion of real negatives also brings more certainty information of the
conversion. To correct the distribution shift, DEFER employs importance
sampling to weigh the loss function. Experimental results on industrial
datasets validate the superiority of DEFER. DEFER have been deployed in the
display advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining over 6.0% improvement on CVR
in several scenarios. The code and data in this paper are now open-sourced

                                        <span>We investigate the use of models from the theory of regularity structure as
features in machine learning tasks. A model is a multi-linear function of a
space-time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be
seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our
work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science
beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a
model feature vector associated to a space-time signal, along with two
algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with
linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments
designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our
experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and
Burgers&#x27; equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our
algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the
experiment with Burgers&#x27; equation, we noticed stability in the prediction power
when noise is added to the observations.</span>

silver bullet diagnostic test to discern COVID infection. Rapid antigen
detection is a screening test to identify COVID positive patients in little as
15 minutes, but has a lower sensitivity than the PCR tests. Besides having
multiple standardized test kits, many people are getting infected &amp; either
recovering or dying even before the test due to the shortage and cost of kits,
lack of indispensable specialists and labs, time-consuming result compared to
bulk population especially in developing and underdeveloped countries.
Intrigued by the parametric deviations in immunological &amp; hematological profile
of a COVID patient, this research work leveraged the concept of COVID-19
detection by proposing a risk-free and highly accurate Stacked Ensemble Machine
Learning model to identify a COVID patient from communally
available-widespread-cheap routine blood tests which gives a promising
accuracy, precision, recall &amp; F1-score of 100%. Analysis from R-curve also
shows the preciseness of the risk-free model to be implemented. The proposed
method has the potential for large scale ubiquitous low-cost screening
application. This can add an extra layer of protection in keeping the number of
infected cases to a minimum and control the pandemic by identifying
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people early.</span>

                                        <span>The pre-trained model (PTM) is revolutionizing Artificial intelligence (AI)
technology. It learns a model with general language features on the vast text
and then fine-tunes the model using a task-specific dataset. Unfortunately, PTM
training requires prohibitively expensive computing devices, especially
fine-tuning, which is still a game for a small proportion of people in the AI
community. Enabling PTMs training on low-quality devices, PatrickStar now makes
PTM accessible to everyone.

PatrickStar reduces memory requirements of computing platforms by using the
CPU-GPU heterogeneous memory space to store model data, consisting of
parameters, gradients, and optimizer states. We observe that the GPU memory
available for model data changes regularly, in a tide-like pattern, decreasing
and increasing iteratively. However, the existing heterogeneous training works
do not take advantage of this pattern. Instead, they statically partition the
model data among CPU and GPU, leading to both memory waste and memory abuse. In
contrast, PatrickStar manages model data in chunks, which are dynamically
distributed in heterogeneous memory spaces. Chunks consist of stateful tensors
which run as finite state machines during training. Guided by the runtime
memory statistics collected in a warm-up iteration, chunks are orchestrated
efficiently in heterogeneous memory and generate lower CPU-GPU data
transmission volume. Symbiosis with the Zero Redundancy Optimizer, PatrickStar
scales to multiple GPUs using data parallelism, with the lowest communication
bandwidth requirements and more efficient bandwidth utilization. Experimental
results show PatrickStar trains a 12 billion parameters GPT model, 2x larger
than the STOA work, on an 8-V100 and 240GB CPU memory node, and is also more
efficient on the same model size.</span>

                                        <span>With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing
large neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained
devices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression
methodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy
consumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such
methodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge
captured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to
various reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the
compression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing
research problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we
point out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be
observed in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample
generation strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch
between the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we
propose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of
generated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching
the real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum
information gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy
of the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art
approaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been
devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.</span>

and voice conversion (VC) systems has caused great harms to automatic speaker
verification (ASV) systems, urging us to design a synthetic speech detection
system to protect ASV systems. In this paper, we propose a new speech
anti-spoofing model named ResWavegram-Resnet (RW-Resnet). The model contains
two parts, Conv1D Resblocks and backbone Resnet34. The Conv1D Resblock is based
on the Conv1D block with a residual connection. For the first part, we use the
raw waveform as input and feed it to the stacked Conv1D Resblocks to get the
ResWavegram. Compared with traditional methods, ResWavegram keeps all the
information from the audio signal and has a stronger ability in extracting
features. For the second part, the extracted features are fed to the backbone
Resnet34 for the spoofed or bonafide decision. The ASVspoof2019 logical access
(LA) corpus is used to evaluate our proposed RW-Resnet. Experimental results
show that the RW-Resnet achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art
anti-spoofing models, which illustrates its effectiveness in detecting
synthetic speech attacks.</span>

reliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as
surveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning

spatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we

embedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on
feature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that
explicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow
between feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn
metrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be
decomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the
overall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to
off-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our
method on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,
Cars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements
over popular metric learning methods with better interpretability. Code is

                                        <span>Large-scale pretraining of visual representations has led to state-of-the-art
performance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of
these techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been
relatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery
product, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from
use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to
general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for
retrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a
billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the
performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to
replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system
and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this
backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised
image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of
clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.
Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that
large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to
industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production
visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%
improvement in click-through volume. We conduct extensive experiments to better
understand the empirical relationships between Transformer-based architectures,
dataset scale, and the performance of production vision systems.</span>

                                        <span>Spectral clustering (SC) is one of the most popular clustering methods and
often outperforms traditional clustering methods. SC uses the eigenvectors of a
Laplacian matrix calculated from a similarity matrix of a dataset. SC has
serious drawbacks: the significant increases in the time complexity derived
from the computation of eigenvectors and the memory space complexity to store
the similarity matrix. To address the issues, I develop a new approximate
spectral clustering using the network generated by growing neural gas (GNG),
called ASC with GNG in this study. ASC with GNG uses not only reference vectors
for vector quantization but also the topology of the network for extraction of
the topological relationship between data points in a dataset. ASC with GNG
calculates the similarity matrix from both the reference vectors and the
topology of the network generated by GNG. Using the network generated from a
dataset by GNG, ASC with GNG achieves to reduce the computational and space
complexities and improve clustering quality. In this study, I demonstrate that
ASC with GNG effectively reduces the computational time. Moreover, this study
shows that ASC with GNG provides equal to or better clustering performance than
SC.</span>

interactions in computer vision, it is still very challenging for robots to
perform complex dexterous manipulation. In this paper, we propose a new
platform and pipeline, DexMV (Dex Manipulation from Videos), for imitation
learning to bridge the gap between computer vision and robot learning. We
design a platform with: (i) a simulation system for complex dexterous
manipulation tasks with a multi-finger robot hand and (ii) a computer vision
system to record large-scale demonstrations of a human hand conducting the same
tasks. In our new pipeline, we extract 3D hand and object poses from the
videos, and convert them to robot demonstrations via motion retargeting. We
then apply and compare multiple imitation learning algorithms with the
demonstrations. We show that the demonstrations can indeed improve robot
learning by a large margin and solve the complex tasks which reinforcement
learning alone cannot solve. Project page with video:

                                        <span>The property of conformal predictors to guarantee the required accuracy rate
makes this framework attractive in various practical applications. However,
this property is achieved at a price of reduction in precision. In the case of
conformal classification, the systems can output multiple class labels instead
of one. It is also known from the literature, that the choice of nonconformity
function has a major impact on the efficiency of conformal classifiers.
Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions
result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural
Network-based conformal classifier, the inverse probability (or hinge loss)
allows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, and margin results in
a larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further
extend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8 different
classification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship
holds or not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the
properties of these two nonconformity functions. The experimental evaluation is
done using 11 real and 5 synthetic datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of
dynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19
spread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of
spatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning
characteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics
laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.
One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate
the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through
the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of
machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for
model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is
objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human
intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of
expertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal
physics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics
of the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the
learning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints,
an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most
informative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable
environment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit
that the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal
accuracy with substantially fewer instances.</span>

well as discriminant analysis and semiparametric density estimation. However,
estimating the optimal model for any given number of components is an NP-hard
problem, and estimating the number of components is in some respects an even
harder problem. Findings: In R, a popular package called mclust addresses both
of these problems. However, Python has lacked such a package. We therefore
introduce AutoGMM, a Python algorithm for automatic Gaussian mixture modeling,
and its hierarchical version, HGMM. AutoGMM builds upon scikit-learn&#x27;s
AgglomerativeClustering and GaussianMixture classes, with certain modifications
to make the results more stable. Empirically, on several different
applications, AutoGMM performs approximately as well as mclust, and sometimes
better. Conclusions: AutoMM, a freely available Python package, enables
efficient Gaussian mixture modeling by automatically selecting the
initialization, number of clusters and covariance constraints.</span>

a popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without
appropriately tuned $\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have
the tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing
training loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity
(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is
typically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in
making the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from
weights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a
method called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be
stacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by
constraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.
Empirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a
deep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization
performance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While
LAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all
optimizers when used with large batch sizes</span>

                                        <span>We use functional mirror ascent to propose a general framework (referred to
as FMA-PG) for designing policy gradient methods. The functional perspective
distinguishes between a policy&#x27;s functional representation (what are its
sufficient statistics) and its parameterization (how are these statistics
represented) and naturally results in computationally efficient off-policy
updates. For simple policy parameterizations, the FMA-PG framework ensures that
the optimal policy is a fixed point of the updates. It also allows us to handle
complex policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) while guaranteeing
policy improvement. Our framework unifies several PG methods and opens the way
for designing sample-efficient variants of existing methods. Moreover, it
recovers important implementation heuristics (e.g., using forward vs reverse KL
divergence) in a principled way. With a softmax functional representation,
FMA-PG results in a variant of TRPO with additional desirable properties. It
also suggests an improved variant of PPO, whose robustness and efficiency we
empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo. Via experiments on simple reinforcement
learning problems, we evaluate algorithms instantiated by FMA-PG.</span>

its edges labeled as &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;dissimilar&quot; by a binary classifier. The goal
is to produce a clustering that minimizes the weight of &quot;disagreements&quot;: the
sum of the weights of &quot;similar&quot; edges across clusters and &quot;dissimilar&quot; edges
within clusters. We study the correlation clustering problem under the
following assumption: Every &quot;similar&quot; edge $e$ has weight
$\mathbf{w}_e\in[\alpha \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{w}]$ and every &quot;dissimilar&quot; edge
$e$ has weight $\mathbf{w}_e\geq \alpha \mathbf{w}$ (where $\alpha\leq 1$ and
$\mathbf{w}&gt;0$ is a scaling parameter). We give a $(3 + 2 \log_e (1/\alpha))$
approximation algorithm for this problem. This assumption captures well the
scenario when classification errors are asymmetric. Additionally, we show an
asymptotically matching Linear Programming integrality gap of $\Omega(\log

extract behavior priors (skills) by fitting generative models to large offline
datasets of demonstrations. However, such generative models inherit the biases
of the underlying data and result in poor and unusable skills when trained on
imperfect demonstration data. To better align skill extraction with human
intent we present Skill Preferences (SkiP), an algorithm that learns a model
over human preferences and uses it to extract human-aligned skills from offline

feedback to solve down-stream tasks with RL. We show that SkiP enables a

and stochastic nature. With their relations to world populations, global
economies and asset valuations, understanding, identifying and forecasting
trends and regimes are highly important. Attempts have been made to forecast
market trends by employing machine learning methodologies, while statistical
techniques have been the primary methods used in developing market regime
switching models used for trading and hedging. In this paper we present a novel
framework for the detection of regime switches within the US financial markets.
Principal component analysis is applied for dimensionality reduction and the
k-means algorithm is used as a clustering technique. Using a combination of
cluster analysis and classification, we identify regimes in financial markets
based on publicly available economic data. We display the efficacy of the
framework by constructing and assessing the performance of two trading

create opportunities for greater edge intelligence. In the domain of vision,
the ability to adapt a Convolutional Neural Network&#x27;s (CNN) structure and
parameters to the input data distribution leads to systems with lower memory
footprint, latency and power consumption. However, due to the limited compute
resources and memory budget on edge devices, it is necessary for the system to
be able to predict the latency and memory footprint of the training process in
order to identify favourable training configurations of the network topology
and device combination for efficient network adaptation. This work proposes
perf4sight, an automated methodology for developing accurate models that
predict CNN training memory footprint and latency given a target device and
network. This enables rapid identification of network topologies that can be
retrained on the edge device with low resource consumption. With PyTorch as the
framework and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as the target device, the developed models
predict training memory footprint and latency with 95% and 91% accuracy
respectively for a wide range of networks, opening the path towards efficient
network adaptation on edge GPUs.</span>

similarity measure between the baseline tasks and the incoming target task. We
first define the notion of task similarity based on the log-determinant of the
Fisher Information Matrices. Next, we compute the task similarity from each of
the baseline tasks to the incoming target task. By utilizing the relation
between a target and a set of learned baseline tasks, the search space of
architectures for the incoming target task can be significantly reduced, making
the discovery of the best candidates in the set of possible architectures
tractable and efficient, in terms of GPU days. This method eliminates the
requirement for training the networks from scratch for the incoming target task
as well as introducing the bias in the initialization of the search space from
the human domain. Experimental results with 8 classification tasks in MNIST and

key task to achieve safe and reliable autonomous driving systems. It is a
challenging problem as agents adjust their behavior depending on their
intentions, the others&#x27; actions, and the road layout. In this paper, we propose
Decoder Fusion RNN (DF-RNN), a recurrent, attention-based approach for motion
forecasting. Our network is composed of a recurrent behavior encoder, an
inter-agent multi-headed attention module, and a context-aware decoder. We
design a map encoder that embeds polyline segments, combines them to create a
graph structure, and merges their relevant parts with the agents&#x27; embeddings.
We fuse the encoded map information with further inter-agent interactions only
inside the decoder and propose to use explicit training as a method to
effectively utilize the information available. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our method by testing it on the Argoverse motion forecasting dataset and show
its state-of-the-art performance on the public benchmark.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, the connections between deep residual networks and
first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been disclosed. In this
work, we further bridge the deep neural architecture design with the
second-order ODEs and propose a novel reversible neural network, termed as
m-RevNet, that is characterized by inserting momentum update to residual
blocks. The reversible property allows us to perform backward pass without
access to activation values of the forward pass, greatly relieving the storage
burden during training. Furthermore, the theoretical foundation based on
second-order ODEs grants m-RevNet with stronger representational power than
vanilla residual networks, which potentially explains its performance gains.
For certain learning scenarios, we analytically and empirically reveal that our
m-RevNet succeeds while standard ResNet fails. Comprehensive experiments on
various image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of our m-RevNet over ResNet, concerning both memory efficiency
and recognition performance.</span>

                                        <span>Retrieving occlusion relation among objects in a single image is challenging
due to sparsity of boundaries in image. We observe two key issues in existing
works: firstly, lack of an architecture which can exploit the limited amount of
coupling in the decoder stage between the two subtasks, namely occlusion
boundary extraction and occlusion orientation prediction, and secondly,
improper representation of occlusion orientation. In this paper, we propose a
novel architecture called Occlusion-shared and Path-separated Network (OPNet),
which solves the first issue by exploiting rich occlusion cues in shared
high-level features and structured spatial information in task-specific
low-level features. We then design a simple but effective orthogonal occlusion
representation (OOR) to tackle the second issue. Our method surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by 6.1%/8.3% Boundary-AP and 6.5%/10% Orientation-AP
on standard PIOD/BSDS ownership datasets. Code is available at

problem of Boolean functional synthesis is to synthesise each output as a
function of inputs such that the specification is met. Although the past few
years have witnessed intense algorithmic development, accomplishing scalability
remains the holy grail. The state-of-the-art approach combines machine learning
and automated reasoning to efficiently synthesise Boolean functions. In this
paper, we propose four algorithmic improvements for a data-driven framework for
functional synthesis: using a dependency-driven multi-classifier to learn
candidate function, extracting uniquely defined functions by interpolation,
variables retention, and using lexicographic MaxSAT to repair candidates. We
implement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan.
The proposed framework is called Manthan2. Manthan2 shows significantly
improved runtime performance compared to Manthan. In an extensive experimental
evaluation on 609 benchmarks, Manthan2 is able to synthesise a Boolean function
vector for 509 instances compared to 356 instances solved by Manthan--- an
increment of 153 instances over the state-of-the-art. To put this into
perspective, Manthan improved on the prior state-of-the-art by only 76
instances.</span>

information between training and test time; additional information is given
about the training data, which is not available at test time. Learning under
this setting is called Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). At the
same time, due to the ordinal nature of affect annotations, formulating affect
modelling tasks as supervised learning ranking problems is gaining ground
within the Affective Computing research community. Motivated by the two facts
above, in this study, we introduce a ranking model that treats additional
information about the training data as privileged information to accurately
rank affect states. Our ranking model extends the well-known RankNet model to
the LUPI paradigm, hence its name AffRankNet+. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first time that a ranking model based on neural networks exploits
privileged information. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on
the public available Afew-VA dataset and compare it against the RankNet model,
which does not use privileged information. Experimental evaluation indicates
that the AffRankNet+ model can yield significantly better performance.</span>

regression. We extend results on regression with quadratic parametrization,
which amounts to depth-2 diagonal linear networks, to more general depth-N
networks, under more realistic settings of noise and correlated designs. We
show that early stopping is crucial for gradient descent to converge to a
sparse model, a phenomenon that we call implicit sparse regularization. This
result is in sharp contrast to known results for noiseless and
uncorrelated-design cases. We characterize the impact of depth and early
stopping and show that for a general depth parameter N, gradient descent with
early stopping achieves minimax optimal sparse recovery with sufficiently small
initialization and step size. In particular, we show that increasing depth
enlarges the scale of working initialization and the early-stopping window,
which leads to more stable gradient paths for sparse recovery.</span>

datasets are already publicly available, nevertheless forcing application
possibilities of machine learning to the domains of those public datasets. The
ever-growing penetration of machine learning algorithms in new application
areas requires solutions for the need for data in those new domains. This
thesis works on active learning as one possible solution to reduce the amount
of data that needs to be processed by hand, by processing only those datapoints
that specifically benefit the training of a strong model for the task. A newly
proposed framework for framing the active learning workflow as a reinforcement
learning problem is adapted for image classification and a series of three
experiments is conducted. Each experiment is evaluated and potential issues
with the approach are outlined. Each following experiment then proposes
improvements to the framework and evaluates their impact. After the last
experiment, a final conclusion is drawn, unfortunately rejecting this work&#x27;s
hypothesis and outlining that the proposed framework at the moment is not
capable of improving active learning for image classification with a trained

(NNS) with the best worst-case guarantees are based on the randomized Locality
Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and its derivatives. In practice, many heuristic
approaches exist to &quot;learn&quot; the best indexing method in order to speed-up NNS,
crucially adapting to the structure of the given dataset.

Oftentimes, these heuristics outperform the LSH-based algorithms on real
datasets, but, almost always, come at the cost of losing the guarantees of
either correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries, or apply to
datasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper, we design an NNS
algorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially
matching that of theoretical algorithms, while optimizing the hashing to the
structure of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on
the minimum-performing query. We evaluate the algorithm&#x27;s ability to optimize
for a given dataset both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical
side, we exhibit a natural setting (dataset model) where our algorithm is much
better than the standard theoretical one. On the practical side, we run
experiments that show that our algorithm has a 1.8x and 2.1x better recall on
the worst-performing queries to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets.</span>

page are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A
search ranking system typically orders the results by independent
query-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such
unilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that
users are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in
practice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require
enforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business
objectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results
does not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a
slate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the
optimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to
slate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework
extended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate
optimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization
(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as
well as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The
proposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as
enforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top
results and personalization of results. Experiments on public datasets and
real-world data from e-commerce datasets show that CSSO outperforms popular
comparable ranking methods in terms of adherence to distributional criteria
while producing comparable or better relevance metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning is gaining instant popularity in computer aided diagnosis of
COVID-19. Due to the high sensitivity of Computed Tomography (CT) to this
disease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the
forefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are
frequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.
This is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is
the mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the
literature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different
published results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to
analyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with
CT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model
training sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is
frequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even
in the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back
to inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more
realistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We
hope that our reproducible investigation will help in curbing hype-driven
claims for the critical problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pave the way for a
more transparent performance evaluation of techniques for CT-based COVID-19
detection.</span>

vulnerable to poisoning and evasion attacks. However, little work has
investigated attacks against decision making algorithms that use text
embeddings, and their output is a ranking. In this paper, we focus on ranking
algorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking
applicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both
white box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their
location in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the
similarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then
uses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We
tested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from
Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on
average the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF
is more successful compared to USE.</span>

(out-of-distribution) indicators based on deep generative models are proposed
recently and are shown to work well on small datasets. In this paper, we
conduct the first large collection of benchmarks (containing 92 dataset pairs,
which is 1 order of magnitude larger than previous ones) for existing OoD
indicators and observe that none perform well. We thus advocate that a large
collection of benchmarks is mandatory for evaluating OoD indicators. We propose
a novel theoretical framework, DOI, for divergence-based Out-of-Distribution
indicators (instead of traditional likelihood-based) in deep generative models.
Following this framework, we further propose a simple and effective OoD
detection algorithm: Single-shot Fine-tune. It significantly outperforms past
works by 5~8 in AUROC, and its performance is close to optimal. In recent, the
likelihood criterion is shown to be ineffective in detecting OoD. Single-shot
Fine-tune proposes a novel fine-tune criterion to detect OoD, by whether the
likelihood of the testing sample is improved after fine-tuning a well-trained
model on it. Fine-tune criterion is a clear and easy-following criterion, which
will lead the OoD domain into a new stage.</span>

                                        <span>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a widely researched tool for
neural architecture search, due to its promising results for image
classification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through
the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture
search. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of
inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a
controlled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be
extended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield
three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,
the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final
performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And
third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training
does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we
conclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from
several runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the
correlation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)
carefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs
of hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.</span>

particular case, where the input layer is one-dimensional, minimal

that the set of minimal networks representing $f$ forms a

function approximation and a simulator. We assume that the agent only has local
access to the simulator, meaning that the agent can only query the simulator at
states that have been visited before. This setting is more practical than many
prior works on reinforcement learning with a generative model. We propose an
algorithm named confident Monte Carlo least square policy iteration (Confident
MC-LSPI) for this setting. Under the assumption that the Q-functions of all
deterministic policies are linear in known features of the state-action pairs,
we show that our algorithm has polynomial query and computational complexities
in the dimension of the features, the effective planning horizon and the
targeted sub-optimality, while these complexities are independent of the size
of the state space. One technical contribution of our work is the introduction
of a novel proof technique that makes use of a virtual policy iteration
algorithm. We use this method to leverage existing results on
$\ell_\infty$-bounded approximate policy iteration to show that our algorithm
can learn the optimal policy for the given initial state even only with local
access to the simulator. We believe that this technique can be extended to
broader settings beyond this work.</span>

Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) at Stanford University - the first
robotic testbed capable of validating machine learning algorithms for
spaceborne optical navigation. The TRON facility consists of two 6
degrees-of-freedom KUKA robot arms and a set of Vicon motion track cameras to
reconfigure an arbitrary relative pose between a camera and a target mockup
model. The facility includes multiple Earth albedo light boxes and a sun lamp
to recreate the high-fidelity spaceborne illumination conditions. After the
overview of the facility, this work details the multi-source calibration
procedure which enables the estimation of the relative pose between the object
and the camera with millimeter-level position and millidegree-level orientation
accuracies. Finally, a comparative analysis of the synthetic and TRON simulated
imageries is performed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained
on the synthetic images. The result shows a considerable gap in the CNN&#x27;s
performance, suggesting the TRON simulated images can be used to validate the
robustness of any machine learning algorithms trained on more easily accessible

                                        <span>Recommender systems aim to provide personalized services to users and are
playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The key of
recommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items
based on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,
purchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing
efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite
graph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,
these GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the
recommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based
recommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable
behaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,
which can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we
investigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)
of existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we
propose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled
designs that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions.
Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and
understand the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our implementation and
datasets can be released after publication.</span>

likely inherit the dataset&#x27;s bias information. As a result, the obtained model
would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life
applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target
task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly
extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation
generated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the
correlation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement
plays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a
cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint
content and local structural representation learning to boost mutual
information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments
on publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) serves as a data privacy-preserved machine learning
paradigm, and realizes the collaborative model trained by distributed clients.
To accomplish an FL task, the task publisher needs to pay financial incentives
to the FL server and FL server offloads the task to the contributing FL
clients. It is challenging to design proper incentives for the FL clients due
to the fact that the task is privately trained by the clients. This paper aims
to propose a contract theory based FL task training model towards minimizing
incentive budget subject to clients being individually rational (IR) and
incentive compatible (IC) in each FL training round. We design a
two-dimensional contract model by formally defining two private types of
clients, namely data quality and computation effort. To effectively aggregate
the trained models, a contract-based aggregator is proposed. We analyze the
feasible and optimal contract solutions to the proposed contract model.
%Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework and contract
model can effective improve the generation accuracy of FL tasks. Experimental
results show that the generalization accuracy of the FL tasks can be improved
by the proposed incentive mechanism where contract-based aggregation is
applied.</span>

                                        <span>Seismic wave propagation forms the basis for most aspects of seismological
research, yet solving the wave equation is a major computational burden that
inhibits the progress of research. This is exaspirated by the fact that new
simulations must be performed when the velocity structure or source location is
perturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general
solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called Neural
Operator. A trained Neural Operator can compute a solution in negligible time
for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train
Neural Operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity
models and source locations. As Neural Operators are grid-free, it is possible
to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on,
providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with
the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method&#x27;s applicability to
seismic tomography, using reverse mode automatic differentiation to compute
gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The
developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using
conventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.</span>

                                        <span>For the problem of task-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL), an agent first
collects samples from an unknown environment without the supervision of reward
signals, then is revealed with a reward and is asked to compute a corresponding
near-optimal policy. Existing approaches mainly concern the worst-case
scenarios, in which no structural information of the reward/transition-dynamics
is utilized. Therefore the best sample upper bound is
$\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the
target accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To
tackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap
parameter, $\rho&gt;0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an
unknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (1/\epsilon \cdot (H^3SA / \rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$
episodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for
a post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\rho$, where $S$ is
the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the length of
the horizon, obtaining a nearly \emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\epsilon$.
We show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\rho 1$. We further show that
$\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H&#x3D;1$ (i.e.,
multi-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark
separation between those settings and the RL setting.</span>

resulting in an increasingly unsustainable crop water demand from reduced
freshwater availability. Achieving food security while deploying water in a
sustainable manner will continue to be a major challenge necessitating careful
monitoring and tracking of agricultural water usage. Historically, monitoring
water usage has been a slow and expensive manual process with many
imperfections and abuses. Ma-chine learning and remote sensing developments
have increased the ability to automatically monitor irrigation patterns, but
existing techniques often require curated and labelled irrigation data, which
are expensive and time consuming to obtain and may not exist for impactful
areas such as developing countries. In this paper, we explore an end-to-end
real world application of irrigation detection with uncurated and unlabeled
satellite imagery. We apply state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning
techniques to optical remote sensing data, and find that we are able to detect
irrigation with up to nine times better precision, 90% better recall and 40%
more generalization ability than the traditional supervised learning methods.</span>

the existence of large &#x60;&#x60;indivisible&#x27;&#x27; sets, called &#x60;&#x60;$\epsilon$-excellent,&#x27;&#x27;
in $k$-edge stable graphs (equivalently, Littlestone classes). Translating to
the language of probability, we find a quite different existence proof for
$\epsilon$-excellent sets in Littlestone classes, using regret bounds in online
learning. This proof applies to any $\epsilon &lt; {1}/{2}$, compared to $&lt;
{1}/{2^{2^k}}$ or so in the original proof. We include a second proof using
closure properties and the VC theorem, with other advantages but weaker bounds.
As a simple corollary, the Littlestone dimension remains finite under some
natural modifications to the definition. A theme in these proofs is the
interaction of two abstract notions of majority, arising from measure, and from
rank or dimension; we prove that these densely often coincide and that this is
characteristic of Littlestone (stable) classes. The last section lists several

                                        <span>We revisit the application of predictive models by the Chicago Department of
Public Health to schedule restaurant inspections and prioritize the detection
of critical violations of the food code. Performing the first analysis from the
perspective of fairness to the population served by the restaurants, we find
that the model treats inspections unequally based on the sanitarian who
conducted the inspection and that in turn there are both geographic and
demographic disparities in the benefits of the model. We examine both
approaches to use the original model in a fairer way and ways to train the
model to achieve fairness and find more success with the former class of
approaches. The challenges from this application point to important directions
for future work around fairness with collective entities rather than
individuals, the use of critical violations as a proxy, and the disconnect
between fair classification and fairness in the dynamic scheduling system.</span>

                                        <span>Embodied conversational agents benefit from being able to accompany their
speech with gestures. Although many data-driven approaches to gesture
generation have been proposed in recent years, it is still unclear whether such
systems can consistently generate gestures that convey meaning. We investigate
which gesture properties (phase, category, and semantics) can be predicted from
speech text and/or audio using contemporary deep learning. In extensive
experiments, we show that gesture properties related to gesture meaning
(semantics and category) are predictable from text features (time-aligned BERT
embeddings) alone, but not from prosodic audio features, while rhythm-related
gesture properties (phase) on the other hand can be predicted from either
audio, text (with word-level timing information), or both. These results are
encouraging as they indicate that it is possible to equip an embodied agent
with content-wise meaningful co-speech gestures using a machine-learning model.</span>

                                        <span>The combination of the traditional convolutional network (i.e., an
auto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention
in clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature
and the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.
However, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to
adaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative
representation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at
different layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior
clustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method
named Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN
exploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node
attribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a
scale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features
embedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN
can jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised
fashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more
flexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and
discriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the
clustering results. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on commonly
used benchmark datasets validate that our AGCN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

augmentation, knowledge transfer, pruning, and quantization for device-robust

pruning mechanism, namely Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), to find a

parameters. The effectiveness of LTH for low-complexity acoustic modeling is
assessed by investigating various data augmentation and compression schemes,
and we report an efficient joint framework for low-complexity multi-device ASC,

$1/10^{4}$ and attain a superior performance (validation accuracy of 74.01% and
Log loss of 0.76) compared to its not compressed seed model. All results

possible to extract lung X-ray characteristics to improve the methods of
examining and diagnosing patients with suspected COVID-19, distinguishing them
from malaria, dengue, H1N1, tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumonia. More
precisely, an intelligent computational model was developed to process lung
X-ray images and classify whether the image is of a patient with COVID-19. The
images were processed and extracted their characteristics. These
characteristics were the input data for an unsupervised statistical learning
method, PCA, and clustering, which identified specific attributes of X-ray
images with Covid-19. The introduction of statistical models allowed a fast
algorithm, which used the X-means clustering method associated with the
Bayesian Information Criterion (CIB). The developed algorithm efficiently
distinguished each pulmonary pathology from X-ray images. The method exhibited
excellent sensitivity. The average recognition accuracy of COVID-19 was 0.93

We propose the Goal-Oriented Script Construction task, where a model produces a
sequence of steps to accomplish a given goal. We pilot our task on the first
multilingual script learning dataset supporting 18 languages collected from
wikiHow, a website containing half a million how-to articles. For baselines, we
consider both a generation-based approach using a language model and a
retrieval-based approach by first retrieving the relevant steps from a large

                                        <span>Recent improvements in the predictive quality of natural language processing
systems are often dependent on a substantial increase in the number of model
parameters. This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but
existing methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of
various model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models.
To understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution
generalization, we define the task of compressing language representation
models such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting. We choose to
address this problem from a causal perspective, attempting to estimate the
average treatment effect (ATE) of a model component, such as a single layer, on
the model&#x27;s predictions. Our proposed ATE-guided Model Compression scheme
(AMoC), generates many model candidates, differing by the model components that
were removed. Then, we select the best candidate through a stepwise regression
model that utilizes the ATE to predict the expected performance on the target
domain. AMoC outperforms strong baselines on dozens of domain pairs across
three text classification and sequence tagging tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently
achieved great success and become a milestone in the field of artificial
intelligence (AI). Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge
model parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from
massive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters
and fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in
huge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been
extensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis.
It is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for
downstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we
take a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special
relation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the
crucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we
comprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs
are driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability
of data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures,
utilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting
interpretation and theoretical analysis. Finally, we discuss a series of open
problems and research directions of PTMs, and hope our view can inspire and
advance the future study of PTMs.</span>

                                        <span>Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest
X-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
Since manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent
auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and
immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the
COVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the
detected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize
the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning
strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the
knowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize
the acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through
observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report
generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical
findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital
of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of
the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale
Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for
further fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT
achieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report
generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset. The
Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset is available at https://covid19ct.github.io/.</span>

                                        <span>Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in
shaping people&#x27;s health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative
effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially
cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical
analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies
to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured
SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much
of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language
processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from
unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system
focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art
transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH
concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract
SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the
difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured
EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the
International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show
that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of
0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH
information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864
patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more
detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only
captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical
narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of
patients&#x27; SBDoH factors.</span>

aspect-given sentence, has drawn widespread applications in social media and
public opinion. Previously researches typically derive aspect-independent
representation by sentence feature generation only depending on text data. In
this paper, we propose a Position-Guided Contributive Distribution (PGCD) unit.
It achieves a position-dependent contributive pattern and generates
aspect-related statement feature for ABSA task. Quoted from Shapley Value, PGCD
can gain position-guided contextual contribution and enhance the aspect-based
representation. Furthermore, the unit can be used for improving effects on
multimodal ABSA task, whose datasets restructured by ourselves. Extensive
experiments on both text and text-audio level using dataset (SemEval) show that
by applying the proposed unit, the mainstream models advance performance in
accuracy and F1 score.</span>

choices for explaining natural language model predictions with relative word
importance scores. These interpretations need to be robust for trustworthy NLP
applications in high-stake areas like medicine or finance. Our paper
demonstrates how interpretations can be manipulated by making simple word
perturbations on an input text. Via a small portion of word-level swaps, these
adversarial perturbations aim to make the resulting text semantically and
spatially similar to its seed input (therefore sharing similar
interpretations). Simultaneously, the generated examples achieve the same
prediction label as the seed yet are given a substantially different
explanation by the interpretation methods. Our experiments generate fragile
interpretations to attack two SOTA interpretation methods, across three popular
Transformer models and on two different NLP datasets. We observe that the rank
order correlation drops by over 20% when less than 10% of words are perturbed
on average. Further, rank-order correlation keeps decreasing as more words get
perturbed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that candidates generated from our
method have good quality metrics.</span>

by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long
dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical
expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of
approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the
perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,
the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we
combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition
system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The
expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were
improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce a new domain expert mixture (DEMix) layer that enables
conditioning a language model (LM) on the domain of the input text. A DEMix
layer is a collection of expert feedforward networks, each specialized to a
domain, that makes the LM modular: experts can be mixed, added or removed after
initial training. Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up
to 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce test-time perplexity,
increase training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation with little overhead.
We show that mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted
ensemble, allows the model to better generalize to heterogeneous or unseen
domains. We also show that experts can be added to iteratively incorporate new
domains without forgetting older ones, and that experts can be removed to
restrict access to unwanted domains, without additional training. Overall,
these results demonstrate benefits of explicitly conditioning on textual
domains during language modeling.</span>

                                        <span>Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become increasingly more
complex and widespread. With recent developments in neural networks, a growing
concern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as
safety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.
Furthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for
accountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these
explanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is
understandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey
provides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate
explanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey
focuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is
learned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of
methods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc
methods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.</span>

capture the associations between them. Prior studies show that pre-trained V&amp;L
models can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks
such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&amp;L models are less effective
when applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes)
due to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying
pre-trained V&amp;L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that
the visual representation in general V&amp;L models is not suitable for processing
medical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a
transformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better
capturing the associations between the two modalities. Experiments on the OpenI
dataset, a commonly used thoracic disease diagnosis benchmark, show that
BERTHop achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.12% which is 1.62%
higher than state-of-the-art (SOTA) while it is trained on a 9 times smaller

                                        <span>Two-stage methods have dominated Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection for
several years. Recently, one-stage HOI detection methods have become popular.
In this paper, we aim to explore the essential pros and cons of two-stage and
one-stage methods. With this as the goal, we find that conventional two-stage
methods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs,
while one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on
multi-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classification.
Therefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from
the conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel
one-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction
classification in a cascade manner. In detail, we first design a human-object
pair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector by removing
the interaction classification module or head and then design a relatively
isolated interaction classifier to classify each human-object pair. Two cascade
decoders in our proposed framework can focus on one specific task, detection or
interaction classification. In terms of the specific implementation, we adopt a
transformer-based HOI detector as our base model. The newly introduced
disentangling paradigm outperforms existing methods by a large margin, with a
significant relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.</span>

                                        <span>In the application of machine learning to remote sensing, labeled data is
often scarce or expensive, which impedes the training of powerful models like
deep convolutional neural networks. Although unlabeled data is abundant, recent
self-supervised learning approaches are ill-suited to the remote sensing
domain. In addition, most remote sensing applications currently use only a
small subset of the multi-sensor, multi-channel information available,
motivating the need for fused multi-sensor representations. We propose a new
self-supervised training objective, Contrastive Sensor Fusion, which exploits
coterminous data from multiple sources to learn useful representations of every
possible combination of those sources. This method uses information common
across multiple sensors and bands by training a single model to produce a
representation that remains similar when any subset of its input channels is
used. Using a dataset of 47 million unlabeled coterminous image triplets, we
train an encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations from any
possible combination of channels from the input sensors. These representations
outperform fully supervised ImageNet weights on a remote sensing classification
task and improve as more sensors are fused. Our code is available at

assisting perception even under complex environments. In this paper, we work
towards developing a computer vision system able to segment objects by
exploiting motion cues, i.e. motion segmentation. We make the following
contributions: First, we introduce a simple variant of the Transformer to
segment optical flow frames into primary objects and the background. Second, we
train the architecture in a self-supervised manner, i.e. without using any
manual annotations. Third, we analyze several critical components of our method
and conduct thorough ablation studies to validate their necessity. Fourth, we
evaluate the proposed architecture on public benchmarks (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2,
and FBMS59). Despite using only optical flow as input, our approach achieves
superior or comparable results to previous state-of-the-art self-supervised
methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. We additionally evaluate on
a challenging camouflage dataset (MoCA), significantly outperforming the other
self-supervised approaches, and comparing favourably to the top supervised
approach, highlighting the importance of motion cues, and the potential bias
towards visual appearance in existing video segmentation models.</span>

                                        <span>Plankton are effective indicators of environmental change and ecosystem
health in freshwater habitats, but collection of plankton data using manual
microscopic methods is extremely labor-intensive and expensive. Automated
plankton imaging offers a promising way forward to monitor plankton communities
with high frequency and accuracy in real-time. Yet, manual annotation of
millions of images proposes a serious challenge to taxonomists. Deep learning
classifiers have been successfully applied in various fields and provided
encouraging results when used to categorize marine plankton images. Here, we
present a set of deep learning models developed for the identification of lake
plankton, and study several strategies to obtain optimal performances,which
lead to operational prescriptions for users. To this aim, we annotated into 35
classes over 17900 images of zooplankton and large phytoplankton colonies,
detected in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) with the Dual Scripps Plankton
Camera. Our best models were based on transfer learning and ensembling, which
classified plankton images with 98% accuracy and 93% F1 score. When tested on
freely available plankton datasets produced by other automated imaging tools
(ZooScan, FlowCytobot and ISIIS), our models performed better than previously
used models. Our annotated data, code and classification models are freely
available online.</span>

                                        <span>While state-of-the-art 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieve very
good results on action recognition datasets, they are computationally very
expensive and require many GFLOPs. While the GFLOPs of a 3D CNN can be
decreased by reducing the temporal feature resolution within the network, there
is no setting that is optimal for all input clips. In this work, we therefore
introduce a differentiable Similarity Guided Sampling (SGS) module, which can
be plugged into any existing 3D CNN architecture. SGS empowers 3D CNNs by
learning the similarity of temporal features and grouping similar features
together. As a result, the temporal feature resolution is not anymore static
but it varies for each input video clip. By integrating SGS as an additional
layer within current 3D CNNs, we can convert them into much more efficient 3D
CNNs with adaptive temporal feature resolutions (ATFR). Our evaluations show
that the proposed module improves the state-of-the-art by reducing the
computational cost (GFLOPs) by half while preserving or even improving the
accuracy. We evaluate our module by adding it to multiple state-of-the-art 3D
CNNs on various datasets such as Kinetics-600, Kinetics-400, mini-Kinetics,
Something-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51.</span>

                                        <span>Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years.
However, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the
user is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often
leads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete
description. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and
extensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous
interactive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users&#x27; feedback
to supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and
requires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework
that conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI
actively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and
users only need to confirm AI&#x27;s proposal. Specifically, we propose an
object-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly
and present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative
objects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due
to the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a
weakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other
than a text-image dataset. Experiments show that our framework significantly
improves the performance of text-based image retrieval. Code is avaiable at

                                        <span>Successful continual learning of new knowledge would enable intelligent
systems to recognize more and more classes of objects. However, current
intelligent systems often fail to correctly recognize previously learned
classes of objects when updated to learn new classes. It is widely believed
that such downgraded performance is solely due to the catastrophic forgetting
of previously learned knowledge. In this study, we argue that the class
confusion phenomena may also play a role in downgrading the classification
performance during continual learning, i.e., the high similarity between new
classes and any previously learned classes would also cause the classifier to
make mistakes in recognizing these old classes, even if the knowledge of these
old classes is not forgotten. To alleviate the class confusion issue, we
propose a discriminative distillation strategy to help the classify well learn
the discriminative features between confusing classes during continual
learning. Experiments on multiple natural image classification tasks support
that the proposed distillation strategy, when combined with existing methods,
is effective in further improving continual learning.</span>

                                        <span>The class activation mapping, or CAM, has been the cornerstone of feature
attribution methods for multiple vision tasks. Its simplicity and effectiveness
have led to wide applications in the explanation of visual predictions and
weakly-supervised localization tasks. However, CAM has its own shortcomings.
The computation of attribution maps relies on ad-hoc calibration steps that are
not part of the training computational graph, making it difficult for us to
understand the real meaning of the attribution values. In this paper, we
improve CAM by explicitly incorporating a latent variable encoding the location
of the cue for recognition in the formulation, thereby subsuming the
attribution map into the training computational graph. The resulting model,
class activation latent mapping, or CALM, is trained with the
expectation-maximization algorithm. Our experiments show that CALM identifies
discriminative attributes for image classifiers more accurately than CAM and
other visual attribution baselines. CALM also shows performance improvements
over prior arts on the weakly-supervised object localization benchmarks. Our

                                        <span>Although using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as backbones achieves
great successes in computer vision, this work investigates a simple backbone
network useful for many dense prediction tasks without convolutions. Unlike the
recently-proposed Transformer model (e.g., ViT) that is specially designed for
image classification, we propose Pyramid Vision Transformer~(PVT), which
overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction
tasks. PVT has several merits compared to prior arts. (1) Different from ViT
that typically has low-resolution outputs and high computational and memory
cost, PVT can be not only trained on dense partitions of the image to achieve
high output resolution, which is important for dense predictions but also using
a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce computations of large feature maps.
(2) PVT inherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer, making it a
unified backbone in various vision tasks without convolutions by simply
replacing CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT by conducting extensive
experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks,
e.g., object detection, semantic, and instance segmentation. For example, with
a comparable number of parameters, RetinaNet+PVT achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO
dataset, surpassing RetinNet+ResNet50 (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP. We hope PVT
could serve as an alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions
and facilitate future researches. Code is available at

In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end GAN architecture that can generate
high-resolution 3D images. We achieve this goal by separating training and
inference. During training, we adopt a hierarchical structure that
simultaneously generates a low-resolution version of the image and a randomly
selected sub-volume of the high-resolution image. The hierarchical design has
two advantages: First, the memory demand for training on high-resolution images
is amortized among subvolumes. Furthermore, anchoring the high-resolution
subvolumes to a single low-resolution image ensures anatomical consistency
between subvolumes. During inference, our model can directly generate full
high-resolution images. We also incorporate an encoder with a similar
hierarchical structure into the model to extract features from the images.
Experiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state of the art in image generation. We also demonstrate clinical
applications of the proposed model in data augmentation, image super-resolution
and clinical-relevant feature extraction.</span>

                                        <span>In current object detection, algorithms require the object to be directly
visible in order to be detected. As humans, however, we intuitively use visual
cues caused by the respective object to already make assumptions about its
appearance. In the context of driving, such cues can be shadows during the day
and often light reflections at night. In this paper, we study the problem of
how to map this intuitive human behavior to computer vision algorithms to
detect oncoming vehicles at night just from the light reflections they cause by
their headlights. For that, we present an extensive open-source dataset
containing 59746 annotated grayscale images out of 346 different scenes in a
rural environment at night. In these images, all oncoming vehicles, their
corresponding light objects (e.g., headlamps), and their respective light
reflections (e.g., light reflections on guardrails) are labeled. In this
context, we discuss the characteristics of the dataset and the challenges in
objectively describing visual cues such as light reflections. We provide
different metrics for different ways to approach the task and report the
results we achieved using state-of-the-art and custom object detection models
as a first benchmark. With that, we want to bring attention to a new and so far
neglected field in computer vision research, encourage more researchers to
tackle the problem, and thereby further close the gap between human performance
and computer vision systems.</span>

detection algorithms arises; the misuse of this formidable A.I. technology
brings serious consequences in the private life of every involved person.
State-of-the-art proliferates with solutions using deep neural networks to
detect a fake multimedia content but unfortunately these algorithms appear to
be neither generalizable nor explainable. However, traces left by Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) engines during the creation of the Deepfakes can be
detected by analyzing ad-hoc frequencies. For this reason, in this paper we
propose a new pipeline able to detect the so-called GAN Specific Frequencies
(GSF) representing a unique fingerprint of the different generative
architectures. By employing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), anomalous
frequencies were detected. The \BETA statistics inferred by the AC coefficients
distribution have been the key to recognize GAN-engine generated data.
Robustness tests were also carried out in order to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the technique using different attacks on images such as JPEG
Compression, mirroring, rotation, scaling, addition of random sized rectangles.
Experiments demonstrated that the method is innovative, exceeds the state of
the art and also give many insights in terms of explainability.</span>

re-identification. Unlike conventional attention-based methods which only learn
a global attention map, our attention pyramid exploits the attention regions in
a multi-scale manner because human attention varies with different scales. Our
attention pyramid imitates the process of human visual perception which tends
to notice the foreground person over the cluttered background, and further
focus on the specific color of the shirt with close observation. Specifically,
we describe our attention pyramid by a &quot;split-attend-merge-stack&quot; principle. We
first split the features into multiple local parts and learn the corresponding
attentions. Then, we merge local attentions and stack these merged attentions
with the residual connection as an attention pyramid. The proposed attention
pyramid is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be applied to
off-the-shelf models. We implement our attention pyramid method in two
different attention mechanisms including channel-wise attention and spatial
attention. We evaluate our method on four largescale person re-identification
benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC, CUHK03, and MSMT17. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms the

meaningfully interact with their environment. In this paper, we take a step
towards that long-term goal -- we extract highly localized actionable
information related to elementary actions such as pushing or pulling for
articulated objects with movable parts. For example, given a drawer, our
network predicts that applying a pulling force on the handle opens the drawer.
We propose, discuss, and evaluate novel network architectures that given image
and depth data, predict the set of actions possible at each pixel, and the
regions over articulated parts that are likely to move under the force. We
propose a learning-from-interaction framework with an online data sampling
strategy that allows us to train the network in simulation (SAPIEN) and
generalizes across categories. Check the website for code and data release:

performance recently and it is of great importance to further understand the
interpretability of these networks. Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc
explanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal
representations learned by deep networks. In this paper, we find that some
hidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus
such behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.
Based on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE
network by the depth selectivity of its hidden units. Moreover, we then propose
a method to train interpretable MDE deep networks without changing their
original architectures, by assigning a depth range for each unit to select.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to enhance the
interpretability of deep MDE networks by largely improving the depth
selectivity of their units, while not harming or even improving the depth
estimation accuracy. We further provide a comprehensive analysis to show the
reliability of selective units, the applicability of our method on different
layers, models, and datasets, and a demonstration on analysis of model error.

related objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends
on the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current
state-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object
independently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where
necessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,
which may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially
in crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to
occlusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to
crowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM
encodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a
corresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the
tracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the
baseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The
proposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by
utilizing relational cues.</span>

While humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first
constructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on
the former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for
the latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human
intelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel
generative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization
problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract
propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic
layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that
LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning
under the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing

Specifically, we use a shared CNN architecture that jointly predicts facial

information concatenated by face features to increase the discrimination of the
CNN for face recognition. This process assists the CNN classifier to better

                                        <span>The aim of re-identification is to match objects in surveillance cameras with
different viewpoints. Although ReID is developing at a considerably rapid pace,
there is currently no processing method for the ReID task in multiple
scenarios. However, such processing method is required in real life scenarios,
such as those involving security. In the present study, a new ReID scenario was
explored, which differs in terms of perspective, background, and pose(walking
or cycling). Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot effectively
handle such a scenario, with the introduction of image datasets being the
optimal solution, in addition to being considerably expensive.

To solve the aforementioned problem, a simple and effective method to
generate images in several new scenarios was proposed, which is names the Copy
and Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The CPP method is based on key point
detection, using copy as paste, to composite a new semantic image dataset in
two different semantic image datasets. As an example, pedestrains and bicycles
can be used to generate several images that show the same person riding on
different bicycles. The CPP method is suitable for ReID tasks in new scenarios
and outperforms the traditional methods when applied to the original datasets
in original ReID tasks. To be specific, the CPP method can also perform better
in terms of generalization for third-party public dataset. The Code and
datasets composited by the CPP method will be available in the future.</span>

                                        <span>Face forgery by deepfake is widely spread over the internet and this raises
severe societal concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel video transformer
with incremental learning for detecting deepfake videos. To better align the
input face images, we use a 3D face reconstruction method to generate UV
texture from a single input face image. The aligned face image can also provide
pose, eyes blink and mouth movement information that cannot be perceived in the
UV texture image, so we use both face images and their UV texture maps to
extract the image features. We present an incremental learning strategy to
fine-tune the proposed model on a smaller amount of data and achieve better
deepfake detection performance. The comprehensive experiments on various public
deepfake datasets demonstrate that the proposed video transformer model with
incremental learning achieves state-of-the-art performance in the deepfake
video detection task with enhanced feature learning from the sequenced data.</span>

community. A lot of work has been done to improve the performance of the
network, although almost always it results in increased computational
complexity. In this paper, we propose a new attention module that not only
achieves the best performance but also has lesser parameters compared to most
existing models. Our attention module can easily be integrated with other
convolutional neural networks because of its lightweight nature. The proposed
network named Dual Multi Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) is comprised of two
parts: the first part is used to extract features at various scales and
aggregate them, the second part uses spatial and channel attention modules in
parallel to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies.

                                        <span>To train accurate deep object detectors under the extreme
foreground-background imbalance, heuristic sampling methods are always
necessary, which either re-sample a subset of all training samples (hard
sampling methods, \eg biased sampling, OHEM), or use all training samples but
re-weight them discriminatively (soft sampling methods, \eg Focal Loss, GHM).
In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such hard/soft sampling methods
for training accurate deep object detectors. While previous studies have shown
that training detectors without heuristic sampling methods would significantly
degrade accuracy, we reveal that this degradation comes from an unreasonable
classification gradient magnitude caused by the imbalance, rather than a lack
of re-sampling/re-weighting. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a simple
yet effective \emph{Sampling-Free} mechanism to achieve a reasonable
classification gradient magnitude by initialization and loss scaling. Unlike
heuristic sampling methods with multiple hyperparameters, our Sampling-Free
mechanism is fully data diagnostic, without laborious hyperparameters
searching. We verify the effectiveness of our method in training anchor-based
and anchor-free object detectors, where our method always achieves higher
detection accuracy than heuristic sampling methods on COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets. Our Sampling-Free mechanism provides a new perspective to address the
foreground-background imbalance. Our code is released at

                                        <span>Context is of fundamental importance to both human and machine vision; e.g.,
an object in the air is more likely to be an airplane than a pig. The rich
notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules,
statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While
previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the
web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual
violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic
Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By
leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity,
object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a
virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain
insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision
using OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human
benchmark for out-of-context recognition, and then compared it with
state-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We
propose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and
contextual information via multi-head attention. Our model captures useful
information for contextual reasoning, enabling human-level performance and
better robustness in out-of-context conditions compared to baseline models
across OCD and other out-of-context datasets. All source code and data are

project these features to 3D points, thus yielding general and rich point
representations. We additionally integrate an attention mechanism to aggregate

                                        <span>In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more and more
powerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with
rapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely
on directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human
behavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,
shadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate
occurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes
even more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by
oncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object
detection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle&#x27;s direct visibility. Based on
previous work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system
capable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at
nighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full
algorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the
image space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and
verifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy
the system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected
vehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this
experimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle
detection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.
Additionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and
real-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this
contribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of
provident object detection and further close the performance gap between human
behavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and
automated driving a step forward.</span>

High-quality synthetic X-ray images can facilitate various applications such as
surgical image guidance systems and VR training simulations. However, it is
difficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view synthetic X-ray images in
real-time due to different CT slice thickness, high computational cost, and the
complexity of algorithms. Our goal is to generate high-resolution synthetic
X-ray images in real-time by upsampling low-resolution images with deep
learning-based super-resolution methods. Reference-based Super Resolution
(RefSR) has been well studied in recent years and has shown higher performance
than traditional Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). It can produce fine
details by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some
artifacts and noise. In this paper, we introduce frequency domain loss as a
constraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with fine
details and without obvious artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper utilizing the frequency domain for the loss functions in the
field of super-resolution. We achieved good results in evaluating our method on

                                        <span>Existing blind image super-resolution (SR) methods mostly assume blur kernels
are spatially invariant across the whole image. However, such an assumption is
rarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially
variant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing
blind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real
applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine
network (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet
has two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to
keep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine
convolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without
increasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made
possible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel
split with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel
splits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the
proposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and
invariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR
performance when combined with non-blind SR methods.</span>

                                        <span>Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision
researchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of
ConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much
progress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned
representations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets&#x27;
features. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer
learning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and
multi-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the
performance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual
ConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones
(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that
indicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.

We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13
downstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained
classification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth
estimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More
specifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network
fine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have
such a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in
multi-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually
beneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant
tasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation
of vision transformers in the future.</span>

as the task of locating the content of the image referenced by the sentence. It
is a challenging task that has several real-world applications in
human-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text
reference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this
problem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual
dependencies better than before. These models are typically constituted by two
main components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for
grounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,
respectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is
not easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to
this issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple
multi-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss
function, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered
datasets, a better learning balance between the two sub-tasks mentioned above.</span>

                                        <span>Normalizing flows have recently demonstrated promising results for low-level
vision tasks. For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse
photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image
rather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves
high accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.
While existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we
set out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the
hierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and
image rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between
HR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the
rest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency
component is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further
enhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are
combined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.
Extensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling
have demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</span>

                                        <span>Medical images, especially volumetric images, are of high resolution and
often exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep
learning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be
downsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.
However, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable
especially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be
preserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be
reconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is
only responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which
consumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we
propose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and
hierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the
high-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can
be 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are
carried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021
(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial
implant design. The dataset contains high-resolution skulls that can be viewed
as 2D manifolds embedded in a 3D space. Codes associated with this study can be

in foggy weather. Collecting and annotating data in such a scenario is very
time, labor and cost intensive. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
simulating physically accurate fog into clear-weather scenes, so that the
abundant existing real datasets captured in clear weather can be repurposed for
our task. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog
simulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset. This unleashes the
acquisition of large-scale foggy training data at no extra cost. These
partially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several
perception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous
localization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments
with several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog
simulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D
object detection in the presence of fog. Thus, we are the first to provide
strong 3D object detection baselines on the Seeing Through Fog dataset. Our

Previous few-shot segmentation methods mainly employ the information of support
images as guidance for query image segmentation. Although some works propose to
build cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of
query information still depends on the support images. We here propose to
extract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the
few-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to
learn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed
global-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined
priors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the
prior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to
perform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction
of query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the
limitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve
better interaction. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves
new state-of-the-art performance for the few-shot segmentation task on
PASCAL-5$^{i}$ and COCO datasets.</span>

indoor scene&#x27;s 3D structure and semantic label. Given noisy depth maps, a
camera trajectory, and 2D semantic labels at train time, the proposed neural
network learns to fuse the depth over frames with suitable semantic labels in
the scene space. Our approach exploits the joint volumetric representation of
the depth and semantics in the scene feature space to solve this task. For a
compelling online fusion of the semantic labels and geometry in real-time, we
introduce an efficient vortex pooling block while dropping the routing network
in online depth fusion to preserve high-frequency surface details. We show that
the context information provided by the semantics of the scene helps the depth
fusion network learn noise-resistant features. Not only that, it helps overcome
the shortcomings of the current online depth fusion method in dealing with thin
object structures, thickening artifacts, and false surfaces. Experimental
evaluation on the Replica dataset shows that our approach can perform depth
fusion at 37, 10 frames per second with an average reconstruction F-score of
88%, and 91%, respectively, depending on the depth map resolution. Moreover,
our model shows an average IoU score of 0.515 on the ScanNet 3D semantic

for several years. They provide a good balance between computing performance
and power consumption which is usually required for mobile platforms, like
application in vehicles for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Autonomous Driving (AD). However, there is an ever-increasing need of more
powerful and efficient SBCs which can run power intensive Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) in real-time and can also satisfy necessary functional safety
requirements such as Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL). ProAI is being
developed by ZF mainly to run powerful and efficient applications such as
multitask DNNs and on top of that it also has the required safety certification
for AD. In this work, we compare and discuss state of the art SBC on the basis
of power intensive multitask DNN architecture called Multitask-CenterNet with
respect to performance measures such as, FPS and power efficiency. As an
automotive supercomputer, ProAI delivers an excellent combination of
performance and efficiency, managing nearly twice the number of FPS per watt
than a modern workstation laptop and almost four times compared to the Jetson
Nano. Furthermore, it was also shown that there is still power in reserve for
further and more complex tasks on the ProAI, based on the CPU and GPU
utilization during the benchmark.</span>

quantity of measurements required for a fusion based dense 3D mapping system to
converge to an accurate, de-noised surface reconstruction. This is achieved
through the use of a Normalised Information Distance metric, that computes the
novelty of the information contained in each incoming frame with respect to the
reconstruction, and avoids fusing those frames that exceed a redundancy
threshold. This provides a principled approach for opitmising the trade-off
between surface reconstruction accuracy and the computational cost of
processing frames. The technique builds upon the ElasticFusion (EF) algorithm
where we report results of the technique&#x27;s scalability and the accuracy of the
resultant maps by applying it to both the ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D datasets.
These results demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in performing
accurate surface reconstructions whilst utilising a fraction of the frames when
compared to the original EF algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Virtual 3D try-on can provide an intuitive and realistic view for online
shopping and has a huge potential commercial value. However, existing 3D
virtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment
templates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual
try-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans,
but lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the
merits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently
and learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the
first attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing
and a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1)
The Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth
map and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage
warping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the
initial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3)
The Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the
non-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality
synthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image
is associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D
human body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more
efficient than other 3D approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest
X-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
Since manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent
auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and
immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the
COVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the
detected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize
the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning
strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the
knowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize
the acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through
observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report
generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical
findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital
of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of
the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale
Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for
further fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT
achieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report
generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset. The
Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset is available at https://covid19ct.github.io/.</span>

                                        <span>Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female
reproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerges as a
non-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease
detection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and
time-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based
classification models. Objective: This study aims to develop a computer-aided
diagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on
self-supervised learning. Methods: Besides high-level semantic features
extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach
leverages unlabeled cervical OCT images&#x27; texture features learned by
contrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT
image dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.
Results: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,
including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical
cancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9798 Plus
or Minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 Plus or Minus 4.99% and a
specificity of 93.96 Plus or Minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it
outperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set. Furthermore, our
method achieved a 91.53% sensitivity and 97.37% specificity on an external
validation dataset containing 287 3D OCT volumes from 118 Chinese patients in a
new hospital using a cross-shaped threshold voting strategy. Conclusion: The
proposed contrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN
models and provided better interpretability based on texture features, which
holds great potential to be used in the clinical protocol of &quot;see-and-treat.&quot;</span>

                                        <span>Many camera sensors use a dual-pixel (DP) design that operates as a
rudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single
capture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus.
Since the DP sensor&#x27;s introduction, researchers have found additional uses for
the DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus
deblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In
particular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the
two sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that
jointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image
improves the network&#x27;s ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments
show this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over
state-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task
framework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~ 39dB PSNR) from the single
input image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based
applications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have
captured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for
the DP-view synthesis task. Our dataset, code, and trained models will be made
publicly available at

                                        <span>Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by
encoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient
retrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning,
central similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data
distribution. For multi-label image retrieval, however, previous methods only
use multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the
learning target, which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash
centers and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the
above issue, we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach,
Instance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS), to automatically learn the center
weight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly, we apply the maximum entropy
regularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function, and
compute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly, we update
neural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center
weights. More importantly, the learned center weights can well reflect the
proportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks, and especially
improves the mAP by 1.6%-6.4% on the MS COCO dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Video question answering has recently received a lot of attention from
multimodal video researchers. Most video question answering datasets are
usually in the form of multiple-choice. But, the model for the multiple-choice
task does not infer the answer. Rather it compares the answer candidates for
picking the correct answer. Furthermore, it makes it difficult to extend to
other tasks. In this paper, we challenge the existing multiple-choice video
question answering by changing it to open-ended video question answering. To
tackle open-ended question answering, we use the pretrained GPT2 model. The
model is fine-tuned with video inputs and subtitles. An ablation study is
performed by changing the existing DramaQA dataset to an open-ended question
answering, and it shows that performance can be improved using video metadata.</span>

                                        <span>More than 90\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal
polyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important
information in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic
polyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and
doctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use
element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features
progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate
plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between
different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred
edges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale
subtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image.
Specifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference
features between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs
at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich
multi-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free
network &quot;LossNet&quot; to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from
bottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and
structural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most
state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet
runs at a real-time speed of $\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \times 352$
image. The source code will be publicly available at

                                        <span>With the significant advancements made in generation of forged video and
audio, commonly known as deepfakes, using deep learning technologies, the
problem of its misuse is a well-known issue now. Recently, a new problem of
generating cloned or synthesized human voice of a person is emerging. AI-based
deep learning models can synthesize any person&#x27;s voice requiring just a few
seconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using
deepfake videos and audios, new deepfake detectors are need that focuses on
both, video and audio. Detecting deepfakes is a challenging task and
researchers have made numerous attempts and proposed several deepfake detection
methods. To develop a good deepfake detector, a handsome amount of good quality
dataset is needed that captures the real world scenarios. Many researchers have
contributed in this cause and provided several deepfake dataset, self generated
and in-the-wild. However, almost all of these datasets either contains deepfake
videos or audio. Moreover, the recent deepfake datasets proposed by researchers
have racial bias issues. Hence, there is a crucial need of a good deepfake
video and audio deepfake dataset. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
Audio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that not only contains deepfake
videos but respective synthesized cloned audios as well. We generated our
dataset using recent most popular deepfake generation methods and the videos
and audios are perfectly lip-synced with each other. To generate a more
realistic dataset, we selected real YouTube videos of celebrities having four
racial backgrounds (Caucasian, Black, East Asian and South Asian) to counter
the racial bias issue. Lastly, we propose a novel multimodal detection method
that detects deepfake videos and audios based on our multimodal Audio-Video
deepfake dataset.</span>

traditional domain adaptation setting is to train on one domain and adapt to
the target domain by exploiting unlabeled data samples from the test set. As
gathering relevant test data is expensive and sometimes even impossible, we
remove any reliance on test data imagery and instead exploit a visual inductive
prior derived from physics-based reflection models for domain adaptation. We
cast a number of color invariant edge detectors as trainable layers in a
convolutional neural network and evaluate their robustness to illumination
changes. We show that the color invariant layer reduces the day-night
distribution shift in feature map activations throughout the network. We
demonstrate improved performance for zero-shot day to night domain adaptation
on both synthetic as well as natural datasets in various tasks, including

                                        <span>Multitask learning is a common approach in machine learning, which allows to
train multiple objectives with a shared architecture. It has been shown that by
training multiple tasks together inference time and compute resources can be
saved, while the objectives performance remains on a similar or even higher
level. However, in perception related multitask networks only closely related
tasks can be found, such as object detection, instance and semantic
segmentation or depth estimation. Multitask networks with diverse tasks and
their effects with respect to efficiency on one another are not well studied.
In this paper we augment the CenterNet anchor-free approach for training
multiple diverse perception related tasks together, including the task of
object detection and semantic segmentation as well as human pose estimation. We
refer to this DNN as Multitask-CenterNet (MCN). Additionally, we study
different MCN settings for efficiency. The MCN can perform several tasks at
once while maintaining, and in some cases even exceeding, the performance
values of its corresponding single task networks. More importantly, the MCN
architecture decreases inference time and reduces network size when compared to
a composition of single task networks.</span>

                                        <span>Coarse-to-fine strategies have been extensively used for the architecture
design of single image deblurring networks. Conventional methods typically
stack sub-networks with multi-scale input images and gradually improve
sharpness of images from the bottom sub-network to the top sub-network,
yielding inevitably high computational costs. Toward a fast and accurate
deblurring network design, we revisit the coarse-to-fine strategy and present a
multi-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three distinct
features. First, the single encoder of the MIMO-UNet takes multi-scale input
images to ease the difficulty of training. Second, the single decoder of the
MIMO-UNet outputs multiple deblurred images with different scales to mimic
multi-cascaded U-nets using a single U-shaped network. Last, asymmetric feature
fusion is introduced to merge multi-scale features in an efficient manner.
Extensive experiments on the GoPro and RealBlur datasets demonstrate that the
proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
accuracy and computational complexity. Source code is available for research

(US) screening. Automatically recognizing the standard plane along with the
corresponding anatomical structures in US image can not only facilitate US
image interpretation but also improve diagnostic efficiency. In this study, we
build a novel multi-label learning (MLL) scheme to identify multiple standard
planes and corresponding anatomical structures of fetus simultaneously. Our
contribution is three-fold. First, we represent the class correlation by word
embeddings to capture the fine-grained semantic and latent statistical
concurrency. Second, we equip the MLL with a graph convolutional network to
explore the inner and outer relationship among categories. Third, we propose a
novel cluster relabel-based contrastive learning algorithm to encourage the
divergence among ambiguous classes. Extensive validation was performed on our
large in-house dataset. Our approach reports the highest accuracy as 90.25% for
standard planes labeling, 85.59% for planes and structures labeling and mAP as
94.63%. The proposed MLL scheme provides a novel perspective for standard plane
recognition and can be easily extended to other medical image classification

source is highlighted. Furthermore, we design a feature purification module
(FPM) to filter the inter-source incompatible features. By the ISAM and FPM,
the multi-source features are effectively fused. In addition, we put forward an
automatic predictor selection network (APS) to select the better prediction of
either the static saliency predictor or the moving object predictor in order to
prevent over-reliance on the failed results caused by low-quality optical flow
maps. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks (i.e.
DAVIS$_{16}$, Youtube-Objects and FBMS) show that the proposed model achieves
compelling performance against the state-of-the-arts. The source code will be

                                        <span>Existing efforts on Just noticeable difference (JND) estimation mainly
dedicate to modeling the visibility masking effects of different factors in
spatial and frequency domains, and then fusing them into an overall JND
estimate. However, the overall visibility masking effect can be related with
more contributing factors beyond those have been considered in the literature
and it is also insufficiently accurate to formulate the masking effect even for
an individual factor. Moreover, the potential interactions among different
masking effects are also difficult to be characterized with a simple fusion
model. In this work, we turn to a dramatically different way to address these
problems with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of formulating and fusing
multiple masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model
directly generates a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) image from a top-down
perspective and calculates the difference map between the original image and
the CPL image as the final JND map. Given an input image, an adaptively
critical point (perceptual lossless threshold), defined as the minimum number
of spectral components in Karhunen-Lo\&#x27;{e}ve Transform (KLT) used for
perceptual lossless image reconstruction, is derived by exploiting the
convergence characteristics of KLT coefficient energy. Then, the CPL image can
be reconstructed via inverse KLT according to the derived critical point.
Finally, the difference map between the original image and the CPL image is
calculated as the JND map. The performance of the proposed JND model is
evaluated with two applications including JND-guided noise injection and
JND-guided image compression. Experimental results have demonstrated that our
proposed JND model can achieve better performance than several latest JND
models.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes with few examples.
Pre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a
feature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based
meta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal
improvements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the
pre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while
novel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that
fine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning
feature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes.
Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning
framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e.,
class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features
for seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is
designed to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as
supplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to
learn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the
prototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype
fusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by
exploiting the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments show that our method:
(i) obtains more accurate prototypes; (ii) achieves superior performance on
both inductive and transductive FSL settings.</span>

                                        <span>Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods are stuck when deployed to
a new unseen scenario despite the success in cross-camera person matching.
Recent efforts have been substantially devoted to domain adaptive person re-id
where extensive unlabeled data in the new scenario are utilized in a
transductive learning manner. However, for each scenario, it is required to
first collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model,
thus restricting their practical application. Instead, we aim to explore
multiple labeled datasets to learn generalized domain-invariant representations
for person re-id, which is expected universally effective for each new-coming
re-id scenario. To pursue practicability in real-world systems, we collect all
the person re-id datasets (20 datasets) in this field and select the three most
frequently used datasets (i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) as unseen
target domains. In addition, we develop DataHunter that collects over 300K+
weak annotated images named YouTube-Human from YouTube street-view videos,
which joins 17 remaining full labeled datasets to form multiple source domains.
On such a large and challenging benchmark called FastHuman (~440K+ labeled
images), we further propose a simple yet effective Semi-Supervised Knowledge
Distillation (SSKD) framework. SSKD effectively exploits the weakly annotated
data by assigning soft pseudo labels to YouTube-Human to improve models&#x27;
generalization ability. Experiments on several protocols verify the
effectiveness of the proposed SSKD framework on domain generalizable person
re-id, which is even comparable to supervised learning on the target domains.
Lastly, but most importantly, we hope the proposed benchmark FastHuman could
bring the next development of domain generalizable person re-id algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new general Graph Adversarial Domain Adaptation (GADA) based on
semantic knowledge reasoning of class structure for solving the problem of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from the big data with non-shared and
imbalanced classes to specified small and imbalanced applications (NI-UDA),
where non-shared classes mean the label space out of the target domain. Our
goal is to leverage priori hierarchy knowledge to enhance domain adversarial
aligned feature representation with graph reasoning. In this paper, to address
two challenges in NI-UDA, we equip adversarial domain adaptation with Hierarchy
Graph Reasoning (HGR) layer and the Source Classifier Filter (SCF). For sparse
classes transfer challenge, our HGR layer can aggregate local feature to
hierarchy graph nodes by node prediction and enhance domain adversarial aligned
feature with hierarchy graph reasoning for sparse classes. Our HGR contributes
to learn direct semantic patterns for sparse classes by hierarchy attention in
self-attention, non-linear mapping and graph normalization. our SCF is proposed
for the challenge of knowledge sharing from non-shared data without negative
transfer effect by filtering low-confidence non-shared data in HGR layer.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show our GADA methods consistently
improve the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA algorithms, e.g. GADA(HGR) can
greatly improve f1 of the MDD by \textbf{7.19\%} and GVB-GD by \textbf{7.89\%}
respectively on imbalanced source task in Meal300 dataset. The code is

performance drop in the presence of domain differences between source and
target datasets. The strong discrimination ability on the source dataset does
not necessarily translate to high classification accuracy on the target
dataset. In this work, we address this cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)
problem by boosting the generalization capability of the model. Specifically,
we teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions
with a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE). NSAE trains the
model by jointly reconstructing inputs and predicting the labels of inputs as
well as their reconstructed pairs. Theoretical analysis based on intra-class
correlation (ICC) shows that the feature embeddings learned from NSAE have
stronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We
also take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning
procedure that achieves better adaption and improves classification performance
in the target domain. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results
show that our proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA methods under
various conditions.</span>

critical but often challenging task. Aiming to automatically learn and extract
knowledge from existing eye-tracking data, we develop a novel method that
creates rich representations of oculomotor scanpaths to facilitate the learning
of downstream tasks. The proposed stimulus-agnostic Oculomotor Behavior
Framework (OBF) model learns human oculomotor behaviors from unsupervised and

outperforms baseline approaches and traditional scanpath methods in autism

box filter is well-known. However, box filter can not keep some features of the
signal, such as edges, corners and the jump in the step function. In this
paper, we present a one-sided box filter that can smooth the signal but keep
the discontinuous features in the signal. More specifically, we perform box
filter on eight one-sided windows, leading to a one-sided box filter that can
preserve corners and edges. Our filter inherits the constant $O(1)$
computational complexity of the original box filter with respect to the window
size and also the linear $O(N)$ computational complexity with respect to the
total number of samples. We performance several experiments to show the
efficiency and effectiveness of this filter. We further compare our filter with
other the-state-of-the-art edge preserving methods. Our filter can be deployed
in a large range of applications where the classical box filter is adopted.</span>

                                        <span>Different from visible cameras which record intensity images frame by frame,
the biologically inspired event camera produces a stream of asynchronous and
sparse events with much lower latency. In practice, the visible cameras can
better perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be
free from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to
work well under fast motion and low illumination. Therefore, the two sensors
can cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this
work, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to
the lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists
of 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background
clutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each
of which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we
transform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline
methods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality
versions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking
algorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective
feature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the
proposed VisEvent dataset, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and
VOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code
will be available at our project page:

                                        <span>Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)
tasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial
perturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application
of a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical
imaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a
black-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are
accessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms
for generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries
can access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate
that UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under
black-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs
using a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate
the validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical
image classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted
and targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success
rates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates
because the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The
vulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.
The results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple
procedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical
image diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.</span>

single frame label for each action instance for training. Owing to label
sparsity, existing work fails to learn action completeness, resulting in
fragmentary action predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
where dense pseudo-labels are generated to provide completeness guidance for
the model. Concretely, we first select pseudo background points to supplement
point-level action labels. Then, by taking the points as seeds, we search for
the optimal sequence that is likely to contain complete action instances while
agreeing with the seeds. To learn completeness from the obtained sequence, we
introduce two novel losses that contrast action instances with background ones
in terms of action score and feature similarity, respectively. Experimental
results demonstrate that our completeness guidance indeed helps the model to
locate complete action instances, leading to large performance gains especially
under high IoU thresholds. Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of our
method over existing state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks: THUMOS&#x27;14,
GTEA, BEOID, and ActivityNet. Notably, our method even performs comparably to
recent fully-supervised methods, at the 6 times cheaper annotation cost. Our

multiple layers in a single network. The framework consists of two innovative
fusion schemes. Firstly, unlike existing multimodal methods that necessitate
individual encoders for different modalities, we verify that multimodal
features can be learnt within a shared single network by merely maintaining
modality-specific batch normalization layers in the encoder, which also enables
implicit fusion via joint feature representation learning. Secondly, we propose
a bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be
exploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two
asymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which
learn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions.
These two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature
interactions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature
discrimination within channels. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic
segmentation and image translation tasks, based on three publicly available
datasets covering diverse modalities. Results indicate that our proposed
framework is general, compact and is superior to state-of-the-art fusion
frameworks.</span>

                                        <span>Tactile sensing plays an important role in robotic perception and
manipulation tasks. To overcome the real-world limitations of data collection,
simulating tactile response in a virtual environment comes as a desirable
direction of robotic research. In this paper, we propose Elastic Interaction of
Particles (EIP) for tactile simulation. Most existing works model the tactile
sensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic
property of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained
physical interaction between the two objects. By contrast, EIP models the
tactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic property is
applied to regulate the deformation of particles during contact. With the
tactile simulation by EIP, we further propose a tactile-visual perception
network that enables information fusion between tactile data and visual images.
The perception network is based on a global-to-local fusion mechanism where
multi-scale tactile features are aggregated to the corresponding local region
of the visual modality with the guidance of tactile positions and directions.
The fusion method exhibits superiority regarding the 3D geometric
reconstruction task.</span>

                                        <span>Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their
interpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very
similar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a
challenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual
information. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based
Math Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the
high-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed
by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long
dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical
expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of
approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the
perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,
the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we
combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition
system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The
expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were
improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.</span>

capture the associations between them. Prior studies show that pre-trained V&amp;L
models can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks
such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&amp;L models are less effective
when applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes)
due to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying
pre-trained V&amp;L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that
the visual representation in general V&amp;L models is not suitable for processing
medical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a
transformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better
capturing the associations between the two modalities. Experiments on the OpenI
dataset, a commonly used thoracic disease diagnosis benchmark, show that
BERTHop achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.12% which is 1.62%

                                        <span>Face recognition (FR) has made extraordinary progress owing to the
advancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias
among different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition
system. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as
the subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst
carrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve
robust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal
denoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for
fair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we
attempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and
ii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of
signal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized
functional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race
information. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual
cross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial
noises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face
decoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that
identity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We
evaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,
RFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition
while achieving state-of-the-art FR performance. Besides, visualization results
also show that the attention maps in PCT can well reveal the
race-related/biased facial regions.</span>

of these methods in computer vision field. However, this progress could not
show any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this
article, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose
estimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using
pre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or
via SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of
Supervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified
versions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the
best architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.
Finally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL
pre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The
error rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,
HMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,
ImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled
images are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL
which showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial
features.</span>

with optimizing the image quality after a partial undersampling of the
measurable $\textit{k}$-space. In our work, we propose to change the focus from
the quality of the reconstructed image to the quality of the downstream image
analysis outcome. Specifically, we propose to optimize the patterns according
to how well a sought-after pathology could be detected or localized in the
reconstructed images. We find the optimal undersampling patterns in
$\textit{k}$-space that maximize target value functions of interest in
commonplace medical vision problems (reconstruction, segmentation, and
classification) and propose a new iterative gradient sampling routine
universally suitable for these tasks. We validate the proposed MRI acceleration
paradigm on three classical medical datasets, demonstrating a noticeable
improvement of the target metrics at the high acceleration factors (for the
segmentation problem at $\times$16 acceleration, we report up to 12%
improvement in Dice score over the other undersampling patterns).</span>

                                        <span>Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe
operation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly
dynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be
used to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity
sensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind
spots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the
phenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and
present AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the
first system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It
requires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be
applied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further
introduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural
network to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity
sensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single
piezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.
We conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000
on-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,
colliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns. AuraSense
achieves 100% and 95.3% true positive proximity detection rates when the arm
approaches static and mobile obstacles respectively, with a true negative rate
over 99%, showing the real-world viability of this system.</span>

and enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR. But the problem
with binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is
not possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional
mono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome
this drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to
binaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But
all the prior approaches missed other most important information required for
the task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording
setup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a
proxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that
adding depth features along with image features improves the performance both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We propose a novel encoder-decoder
architecture, where we use a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode the
image and depth feature extracted from individual transformer backbone, with
audio features at each layer of the decoder.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a neural rendering method for controllable portrait video
synthesis. Recent advances in volumetric neural rendering, such as neural
radiance fields (NeRF), has enabled the photorealistic novel view synthesis of
static scenes with impressive results. However, modeling dynamic and
controllable objects as part of a scene with such scene representations is
still challenging. In this work, we design a system that enables both novel
view synthesis for portrait video, including the human subject and the scene
background, and explicit control of the facial expressions through a
low-dimensional expression representation. We leverage the expression space of
a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) to represent the distribution of human facial
expressions, and use it to condition the NeRF volumetric function. Furthermore,
we impose a spatial prior brought by 3DMM fitting to guide the network to learn
disentangled control for scene appearance and facial actions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of portrait videos with
expression controls. To train a scene, our method only requires a short video
of a subject captured by a mobile device.</span>

both explicit and implicit representations, provides derivatives at occlusion
boundaries, and is fast and simple to implement. The method first samples the
surface using non-differentiable rasterization, then applies differentiable,
depth-aware point splatting to produce the final image. Our approach requires
no differentiable meshing or rasterization steps, making it efficient for large
3D models and applicable to isosurfaces extracted from implicit surface
definitions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for implicit-,
mesh-, and parametric-surface-based inverse rendering and neural-network

differentiable rendering of an isosurface extracted from a neural radiance
field (NeRF), and demonstrate surface-based, rather than volume-based,

                                        <span>Pruning is a well-known mechanism for reducing the computational cost of deep
convolutional networks. However, studies have shown the potential of pruning as
a form of regularization, which reduces overfitting and improves
generalization. We demonstrate that this family of strategies provides
additional benefits beyond computational performance and generalization. Our
analyses reveal that pruning structures (filters and/or layers) from
convolutional networks increase not only generalization but also robustness to
adversarial images (natural images with content modified). Such achievements
are possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides
regularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial
images. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with
adversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains
competitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and
low-cost training). We confirm these findings on several adversarial attacks
and architectures; thus suggesting the potential of pruning as a novel defense
mechanism against adversarial images.</span>

with known camera parameters, whereas pose estimation from multiple cameras
with unknown positions and orientations received much less attention. In this
paper, we show how to train a neural model that can perform accurate 3D pose
and camera estimation, takes into account joint location uncertainty due
occlusion from multiple views, and requires only 2D keypoint data for training.
Our method outperforms both classical bundle adjustment and weakly-supervised
monocular 3D baselines on the well-established Human3.6M dataset, as well as
the more challenging in-the-wild Ski-Pose PTZ dataset with moving cameras. We
provide an extensive ablation study separating the error due to the camera

from the additional error introduced by our model.</span>

node features for attributed graph, we introduce self-supervised learning
mechanism to graph representation learning and propose a novel Self-supervised
Consensus Representation Learning (SCRL) framework. In contrast to most
existing works that only explore one graph, our proposed SCRL method treats
graph from two perspectives: topology graph and feature graph. We argue that
their embeddings should share some common information, which could serve as a
supervisory signal. Specifically, we construct the feature graph of node
features via k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Then graph convolutional network
(GCN) encoders extract features from two graphs respectively. Self-supervised
loss is designed to maximize the agreement of the embeddings of the same node
in the topology graph and the feature graph. Extensive experiments on real
citation networks and social networks demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed SCRL over the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node
classification task. Meanwhile, compared with its main competitors, SCRL is
rather efficient.</span>

discover and purchase products online. With increasing concerns on the
transparency and accountability of AI systems, studies on explainable
information retrieval has received more and more attention in the research
community. Interestingly, in the domain of e-commerce, despite the extensive
studies on explainable product recommendation, the studies of explainable
product search is still in an early stage. In this paper, we study how to
construct effective explainable product search by comparing model-agnostic
explanation paradigms with model-intrinsic paradigms and analyzing the
important factors that determine the performance of product search
explanations. We propose an explainable product search model with
model-intrinsic interpretability and conduct crowdsourcing to compare it with
the state-of-the-art explainable product search model with model-agnostic
interpretability. We observe that both paradigms have their own advantages and
the effectiveness of search explanations on different properties are affected
by different factors. For example, explanation fidelity is more important for
user&#x27;s overall satisfaction on the system while explanation novelty may be more
useful in attracting user purchases. These findings could have important
implications for the future studies and design of explainable product search
engines.</span>

                                        <span>Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug
localization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy
of these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant
number of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to
existing studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these
bug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent
evidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain
enough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one
hand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a
sufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious
doubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In
this article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an
in-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query
selection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a
dataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the
literature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,
near-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three
research questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction
approaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for
bug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they
contain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal
queries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of
several keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.
Furthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of
non-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.</span>

                                        <span>Entity alignment (EA) aims to find the equivalent entities in different KGs,
which is a crucial step in integrating multiple KGs. However, most existing EA
methods have poor scalability and are unable to cope with large-scale datasets.
We summarize three issues leading to such high time-space complexity in
existing EA methods: (1) Inefficient graph encoders, (2) Dilemma of negative
sampling, and (3) &quot;Catastrophic forgetting&quot; in semi-supervised learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel EA method with three new
components to enable high Performance, high Scalability, and high Robustness
(PSR): (1) Simplified graph encoder with relational graph sampling, (2)
Symmetric negative-free alignment loss, and (3) Incremental semi-supervised
learning. Furthermore, we conduct detailed experiments on several public
datasets to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.
The experimental results show that PSR not only surpasses the previous SOTA in
performance but also has impressive scalability and robustness.</span>

                                        <span>Graph-based recommendation models work well for top-N recommender systems due
to their capability to capture the potential relationships between entities.
However, most of the existing methods only construct a single global item graph
shared by all the users and regrettably ignore the diverse tastes between
different user groups. Inspired by the success of local models for
recommendation, this paper provides the first attempt to investigate multiple
local item graphs along with a global item graph for graph-based recommendation
models. We argue that recommendation on global and local graphs outperforms
that on a single global graph or multiple local graphs. Specifically, we
propose a novel graph-based recommendation model named GLIMG (Global and Local
IteM Graphs), which simultaneously captures both the global and local user
tastes. By integrating the global and local graphs into an adapted
semi-supervised learning model, users&#x27; preferences on items are propagated
globally and locally. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets
show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the art
counterparts on the top-N recommendation task.</span>

                                        <span>Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business
domain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,
it is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate
(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have
overlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the
specific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in
various business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result
in domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model
to work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to
handle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive
Recommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of
the shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared
parameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the
domain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined
prediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its
parameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result
from production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.
Since 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of
Alibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue
Per Mille).</span>

ranking decisions. These metrics often consider the membership of items to
particular groups, often identified using protected attributes such as gender
or ethnicity. To date, these metrics typically assume the availability and
completeness of protected attribute labels of items. However, the protected
attributes of individuals are rarely present, limiting the application of fair
ranking metrics in large scale systems. In order to address this problem, we
propose a sampling strategy and estimation technique for four fair ranking
metrics. We formulate a robust and unbiased estimator which can operate even
with very limited number of labeled items. We evaluate our approach using both

                                        <span>Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.
However, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank
models is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).
Thus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important
research field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can
be generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with
logged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by
estimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online
learning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a
unified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging
for researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people
who are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve
this problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily
configure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR
algorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click
models that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model
architecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline
creation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly
describe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the
toolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed
that the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important
resource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with
different configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the
supported features.</span>

                                        <span>Prediction over tabular data is an essential task in many data science
applications such as recommender systems, online advertising, medical
treatment, etc. Tabular data is structured into rows and columns, with each row
as a data sample and each column as a feature attribute. Both the columns and
rows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model
prediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column
patterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples
independently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named
Retrieval &amp; Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and
cross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages
search engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to
assist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction
networks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the
retrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive
experiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction
(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction
(regression). Experimental results show that RIM achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art and various baselines, demonstrating the
superiority and efficacy of RIM.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the
information retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to
developing effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new
data. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike
the effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under
normal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst
case or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into
the real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in
average, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the
question in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this
question, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the
robustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a
multi-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The
performance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)
setting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The
defensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions
can be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading
to 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding
benchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze
the robustness of several representative neural ranking models against
traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The
empirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While
neural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases,
some of them can still win 1 out of 5 tasks. This is the first comprehensive
study on the robustness of neural ranking models.</span>

isolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing
awareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data
scattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this
dilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a
privacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In
this work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special
concern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity
refers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and
independent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.
Traditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual
models under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a
backbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common
knowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and
efficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To
facilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA
datasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in
practice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant
improvements against the baselines over all the datasets.</span>

(e.g., Uber or Lyft) have attracted much attention from both the academia and
the industry. In this paper, we consider an important dynamic car-hailing
problem, namely \textit{maximum revenue vehicle dispatching} (MRVD), in which
rider requests dynamically arrive and drivers need to serve as many riders as
possible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove
that the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic
car-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the
problem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based
vehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning
algorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates
the idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With
the information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time
periods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms
to efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall
revenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our
proposed approaches over both real and synthetic datasets.</span>

High-quality synthetic X-ray images can facilitate various applications such as
surgical image guidance systems and VR training simulations. However, it is
difficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view synthetic X-ray images in
real-time due to different CT slice thickness, high computational cost, and the
complexity of algorithms. Our goal is to generate high-resolution synthetic
X-ray images in real-time by upsampling low-resolution images with deep
learning-based super-resolution methods. Reference-based Super Resolution
(RefSR) has been well studied in recent years and has shown higher performance
than traditional Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). It can produce fine
details by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some
artifacts and noise. In this paper, we introduce frequency domain loss as a
constraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with fine
details and without obvious artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper utilizing the frequency domain for the loss functions in the
field of super-resolution. We achieved good results in evaluating our method on
both synthetic and real X-ray image datasets.</span>

their exceptional ability to find complex relations in large datasets, the
strengthening of regulations on data ownership and privacy is causing
increasing difficulty in its application to medical data. In light of this,
Federated Learning has recently been proposed as a solution to train on private
data without breach of confidentiality. This conservation of privacy is
particularly appealing in the field of healthcare, where patient data is highly
confidential. However, many studies have shown that its assumption of
Independent and Identically Distributed data is unrealistic for medical data.
In this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Cluster Models, a hierarchical
clustering-based FL process, to predict Major Depressive Disorder severity from
Heart Rate Variability. By allowing clients to receive more personalized model,
we address problems caused by non-IID data, showing an accuracy increase in
severity prediction. This increase in performance may be sufficient to use
Personalized Federated Cluster Models in many existing Federated Learning

(DNNs)is obviously important. In this work, we prove an embedding principle
that the loss landscape of a DNN &quot;contains&quot; all the critical points of all the
narrower DNNs. More precisely, we propose a critical embedding such that any
critical point, e.g., local or global minima, of a narrower DNN can be embedded
to a critical point/hyperplane of the target DNN with higher degeneracy and
preserving the DNN output function. The embedding structure of critical points
is independent of loss function and training data, showing a stark difference
from other nonconvex problems such as protein-folding. Empirically, we find
that a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that
are embedded from narrow DNNs. The embedding principle provides an explanation
for the general easy optimization of wide DNNs and unravels a potential
implicit low-complexity regularization during the training. Overall, our work
provides a skeleton for the study of loss landscape of DNNs and its
implication, by which a more exact and comprehensive understanding can be

observations, is a central building block of artificial general intelligence.
While humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first
constructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on
the former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for
the latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human
intelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel
generative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization
problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract
propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic
layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that
LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning
under the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing

                                        <span>Email threat is a serious issue for enterprise security, which consists of
various malicious scenarios, such as phishing, fraud, blackmail and
malvertisement. Traditional anti-spam gateway commonly requires to maintain a
greylist to filter out unexpected emails based on suspicious vocabularies
existed in the mail subject and content. However, the signature-based approach
cannot effectively discover novel and unknown suspicious emails that utilize
various hot topics at present, such as COVID-19 and US election. To address the
problem, in this paper, we present Holmes, an efficient and lightweight
semantic based engine for anomalous email detection. Holmes can convert each
event log of email to a sentence through word embedding then extract
interesting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations,
we claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between
senders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources,
which can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the
performance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends
and receives around 5,000 emails each day. As a result, Holmes can achieve a
high detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain
a low false alarm rate for anomaly detection.</span>

                                        <span>In the past decade, contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms
have been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as
online advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they
have yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as
healthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the
underlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over
different environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are
subject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static
environment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental
shifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the
environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose
multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying
mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature
and introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance
is only relevant if unobserved confounders are present and show that, in that
case, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across
environments under suitable assumptions. Our results may be a first step
towards solving the environmental shift problem. They also establish concrete
connections among causality, invariance and contextual bandits.</span>

                                        <span>Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying
features of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many
applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,
computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.
In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a
binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast
computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial
network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning
process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into
binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training
of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from
synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is
directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the
model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better
maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other
vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to
the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of
our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of
our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible
with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that
our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage,
while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.</span>

                                        <span>The control variates (CV) method is widely used in policy gradient estimation
to reduce the variance of the gradient estimators in practice. A control
variate is applied by subtracting a baseline function from the state-action
value estimates. Then the variance-reduced policy gradient presumably leads to
higher learning efficiency. Recent research on control variates with deep
neural net policies mainly focuses on scalar-valued baseline functions. The
effect of vector-valued baselines is under-explored. This paper investigates
variance reduction with coordinate-wise and layer-wise control variates
constructed from vector-valued baselines for neural net policies. We present
experimental evidence suggesting that lower variance can be obtained with such
baselines than with the conventional scalar-valued baseline. We demonstrate how
to equip the popular Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with these
new control variates. We show that the resulting algorithm with proper
regularization can achieve higher sample efficiency than scalar control
variates in continuous control benchmarks.</span>

robust to task-irrelevant distractors. We demonstrate our method on a mobile
ground robot in open-world exploration scenarios. Given an image of a goal that
is up to 80 meters away, our method leverages its representation to explore and
discover the goal in under 20 minutes, even amidst previously-unseen obstacles

to their capability to capture the potential relationships between entities.
However, most of the existing methods only construct a single global item graph
shared by all the users and regrettably ignore the diverse tastes between
different user groups. Inspired by the success of local models for
recommendation, this paper provides the first attempt to investigate multiple
local item graphs along with a global item graph for graph-based recommendation
models. We argue that recommendation on global and local graphs outperforms
that on a single global graph or multiple local graphs. Specifically, we
propose a novel graph-based recommendation model named GLIMG (Global and Local
IteM Graphs), which simultaneously captures both the global and local user
tastes. By integrating the global and local graphs into an adapted
semi-supervised learning model, users&#x27; preferences on items are propagated
globally and locally. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets

often exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep
learning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be
downsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.
However, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable
especially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be
preserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be
reconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is
only responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which
consumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we
propose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and
hierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the
high-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can
be 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are
carried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021
(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial
implant design. The dataset contains high-resolution skulls that can be viewed
as 2D manifolds embedded in a 3D space. Codes associated with this study can be

                                        <span>We introduce a new supervised learning algorithm based to train spiking
neural networks for classification. The algorithm overcomes a limitation of
existing multi-spike learning methods: it solves the problem of interference
between interacting output spikes during a learning trial. This problem of
learning interference causes learning performance in existing approaches to
decrease as the number of output spikes increases, and represents an important
limitation in existing multi-spike learning approaches. We address learning
interference by introducing a novel mechanism to balance the magnitudes of
weight adjustments during learning, which in theory allows every spike to
simultaneously converge to their desired timings. Our results indicate that our
method achieves significantly higher memory capacity and faster convergence
compared to existing approaches for multi-spike classification. In the
ubiquitous Iris and MNIST datasets, our algorithm achieves competitive
predictive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Many recurrent neural network machine learning paradigms can be formulated
using state-space representations. The classical notion of canonical
state-space realization is adapted in this paper to accommodate semi-infinite
inputs so that it can be used as a dimension reduction tool in the recurrent
networks setup. The so-called input forgetting property is identified as the
key hypothesis that guarantees the existence and uniqueness (up to system
isomorphisms) of canonical realizations for causal and time-invariant
input/output systems with semi-infinite inputs. Additionally, the notion of
optimal reduction coming from the theory of symmetric Hamiltonian systems is
implemented in our setup to construct canonical realizations out of input
forgetting but not necessarily canonical ones. These two procedures are studied
in detail in the framework of linear fading memory input/output systems.
Finally, the notion of implicit reduction using reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHS) is introduced which allows, for systems with linear readouts, to
achieve dimension reduction without the need to actually compute the reduced
spaces introduced in the first part of the paper.</span>

                                        <span>In today&#x27;s software world with its cornucopia of reusable software libraries,
when a programmer is faced with a programming task that they suspect can be
completed through the use of a library, they often look for code examples using
a search engine and then manually adapt found examples to their specific
context of use. We put forward a vision based on a new breed of developer tools
that have the potential to largely automate this process. The key idea is to
adapt code autocompletion tools such that they take into account not only the
developer&#x27;s already-written code but also the intent of the task the developer
is trying to achieve next, formulated in plain natural language. We call this
practice of enriching the code with natural language intent to facilitate its
completion natural language-guided programming.

To show that this idea is feasible we design, implement and benchmark a tool
that solves this problem in the context of a specific domain (data science) and
a specific programming language (Python). Central to the tool is the use of
language models trained on a large corpus of documented code. Our initial
experiments confirm the feasibility of the idea but also make it clear that we
have only scratched the surface of what may become possible in the future. We
end the paper with a comprehensive research agenda to stimulate additional
research in the budding area of natural language-guided programming.</span>

                                        <span>Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug
localization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy
of these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant
number of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to
existing studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these
bug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent
evidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain
enough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one
hand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a
sufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious
doubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In
this article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an
in-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query
selection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a
dataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the
literature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,
near-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three
research questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction
approaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for
bug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they
contain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal
queries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of
several keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.
Furthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of
non-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.</span>

on. This information leaks either through the model itself or through
predictions made by the model. Consequently, when the training data contains
sensitive attributes, assessing the amount of information leakage is paramount.
We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of
the model about the data. Unlike the worst-case a priori guarantees of
differential privacy, Fisher information loss measures leakage with respect to
specific examples, attributes, or sub-populations within the dataset. We
motivate Fisher information loss through the Cram\&#x27;{e}r-Rao bound and delineate
the implied threat model. We provide efficient methods to compute Fisher
information loss for output-perturbed generalized linear models. Finally, we
empirically validate Fisher information loss as a useful measure of information
leakage.</span>

optimization by recommending next element the user might want to click on. We
analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000
mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts
the next element that the user clicks given the user&#x27;s click history, the
structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the
time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with
a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our

leaves of a tree, expressing the relationships among these measurements. For
example, companies belong to industries, which in turn belong to ever coarser
divisions such as sectors; microbes are commonly arranged in a taxonomic
hierarchy from species to kingdoms; street blocks belong to neighborhoods,
which in turn belong to larger-scale regions. The problem of tree-based
aggregation that we consider in this paper asks which of these tree-defined
subgroups of leaves should really be treated as a single entity and which of
these entities should be distinguished from each other.

We introduce the &quot;false split rate&quot;, an error measure that describes the
degree to which subgroups have been split when they should not have been. We
then propose a multiple hypothesis testing algorithm for tree-based
aggregation, which we prove controls this error measure. We focus on two main
examples of tree-based aggregation, one which involves aggregating means and
the other which involves aggregating regression coefficients. We apply this
methodology to aggregate stocks based on their volatility and to aggregate
neighborhoods of New York City based on taxi fares.</span>

subsets of $L^2$ when only a weighted Monte Carlo estimate of the $L^2$-norm
can be computed. Of particular interest in this setting is the concept of
sample complexity, the number of samples that are necessary to recover the best
approximation. Bounds for this quantity have been derived in a previous work
and depend primarily on the model class and are not influenced positively by
the regularity of the sought function. This result however is only a worst-case
bound and is not able to explain the remarkable performance of iterative hard
thresholding algorithms that is observed in practice. We reexamine the results
of the previous paper and derive a new bound that is able to utilize the
regularity of the sought function. A critical analysis of our results allows us
to derive a sample efficient algorithm for the model set of low-rank tensors.
The viability of this algorithm is demonstrated by recovering quantities of
interest for a classical high-dimensional random partial differential equation.</span>

classifiers have been successfully applied in various fields and provided
encouraging results when used to categorize marine plankton images. Here, we
present a set of deep learning models developed for the identification of lake
plankton, and study several strategies to obtain optimal performances,which
lead to operational prescriptions for users. To this aim, we annotated into 35
classes over 17900 images of zooplankton and large phytoplankton colonies,
detected in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) with the Dual Scripps Plankton
Camera. Our best models were based on transfer learning and ensembling, which
classified plankton images with 98% accuracy and 93% F1 score. When tested on
freely available plankton datasets produced by other automated imaging tools
(ZooScan, FlowCytobot and ISIIS), our models performed better than previously
used models. Our annotated data, code and classification models are freely
available online.</span>

and renders 3D objects and scenes only from 2D observations. The network models
3D geometries as a general radiance field, which takes a set of 2D images with
camera poses and intrinsics as input, constructs an internal representation for
each point of the 3D space, and then renders the corresponding appearance and
geometry of that point viewed from an arbitrary position. The key to our
approach is to learn local features for each pixel in 2D images and to then
project these features to 3D points, thus yielding general and rich point
representations. We additionally integrate an attention mechanism to aggregate
pixel features from multiple 2D views, such that visual occlusions are
implicitly taken into account. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can generate high-quality and realistic novel views for novel objects,
unseen categories and challenging real-world scenes.</span>

                                        <span>Attention mechanism of late has been quite popular in the computer vision
community. A lot of work has been done to improve the performance of the
network, although almost always it results in increased computational
complexity. In this paper, we propose a new attention module that not only
achieves the best performance but also has lesser parameters compared to most
existing models. Our attention module can easily be integrated with other
convolutional neural networks because of its lightweight nature. The proposed
network named Dual Multi Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) is comprised of two
parts: the first part is used to extract features at various scales and
aggregate them, the second part uses spatial and channel attention modules in
parallel to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies.
We benchmark our network performance for Image Classification on ImageNet
dataset, Object Detection and Instance Segmentation both on MS COCO dataset.</span>

in learning theory. In this paper we study the properties of empirical risk
minimization for time series. The analysis is carried out in a general
framework that covers different types of forecasting applications encountered
in the literature. We are concerned with 1-step-ahead prediction of a
univariate time series generated by a parameter-driven process. A class of
recursive algorithms is available to forecast the time series. The algorithms
are recursive in the sense that the forecast produced in a given period is a
function of the lagged values of the forecast and of the time series. The
relationship between the generating mechanism of the time series and the class
of algorithms is unspecified. Our main result establishes that the algorithm
chosen by empirical risk minimization achieves asymptotically the optimal
predictive performance that is attainable within the class of algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated superior capability
of tackling graph analytical problems in various applications. Nevertheless,
with the wide-spreading practice of GNNs in high-stake decision-making
processes, there is an increasing societal concern that GNNs could make
discriminatory decisions that may be illegal towards certain demographic
groups. Although some explorations have been made towards developing fair GNNs,
existing approaches are tailored for a specific GNN model. However, in
practical scenarios, myriads of GNN variants have been proposed for different
tasks, and it is costly to train and fine-tune existing debiasing models for
different GNNs. Also, bias in a trained model could originate from training
data, while how to mitigate bias in the graph data is usually overlooked. In
this work, different from existing work, we first propose novel definitions and
metrics to measure the bias in an attributed network, which leads to the
optimization objective to mitigate bias. Based on the optimization objective,
we develop a framework named EDITS to mitigate the bias in attributed networks
while preserving useful information. EDITS works in a model-agnostic manner,
which means that it is independent of the specific GNNs applied for downstream
tasks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the validity of the proposed bias metrics and the superiority of
EDITS on both bias mitigation and utility maintenance. Open-source
implementation: https://github.com/yushundong/EDITS.</span>

                                        <span>Cardinality estimation is a fundamental but long unresolved problem in query
optimization. Recently, multiple papers from different research groups
consistently report that learned models have the potential to replace existing
cardinality estimators. In this paper, we ask a forward-thinking question: Are
we ready to deploy these learned cardinality models in production? Our study
consists of three main parts. Firstly, we focus on the static environment
(i.e., no data updates) and compare five new learned methods with eight
traditional methods on four real-world datasets under a unified workload
setting. The results show that learned models are indeed more accurate than
traditional methods, but they often suffer from high training and inference
costs. Secondly, we explore whether these learned models are ready for dynamic
environments (i.e., frequent data updates). We find that they cannot catch up
with fast data up-dates and return large errors for different reasons. For less
frequent updates, they can perform better but there is no clear winner among
themselves. Thirdly, we take a deeper look into learned models and explore when
they may go wrong. Our results show that the performance of learned methods can
be greatly affected by the changes in correlation, skewness, or domain size.
More importantly, their behaviors are much harder to interpret and often
unpredictable. Based on these findings, we identify two promising research
directions (control the cost of learned models and make learned models
trustworthy) and suggest a number of research opportunities. We hope that our
study can guide researchers and practitioners to work together to eventually
push learned cardinality estimators into real database systems.</span>

maximization of non-submodular non-decreasing set functions. We consider the
standard greedy paradigm, along with its distributed greedy and stochastic
greedy variants. Our theoretical guarantees are characterized by the
combination of submodularity and supermodularity ratios. We argue how these
parameters define tight modular bounds based on incremental gains, and provide
a novel reinterpretation of the classical greedy algorithm using the
minorize-maximize (MM) principle. Based on that analogy, we propose a new class
of methods exploiting any plausible modular bound. In the context of optimal
experimental design for linear Bayesian inverse problems, we bound the
submodularity and supermodularity ratios when the underlying objective is based
on mutual information. We also develop novel modular bounds for the mutual
information in this setting, and describe certain connections to polyhedral
combinatorics. We discuss how algorithms using these modular bounds relate to
established statistical notions such as leverage scores and to more recent
efforts such as volume sampling. We demonstrate our theoretical findings on
synthetic problems and on a real-world climate monitoring example.</span>

make assumptions about the underlying decision-problem that restrict them to
classification problems. Prior work has translated these definitions to other
machine learning environments, such as unsupervised learning and reinforcement
learning, by implementing their closest mathematical equivalent. As a result,
there are numerous bespoke interpretations of these definitions. Instead, we
provide a generalized set of group fairness definitions that unambiguously
extend to all machine learning environments while still retaining their
original fairness notions. We derive two fairness principles that enable such a
generalized framework. First, our framework measures outcomes in terms of
utilities, rather than predictions, and does so for both the decision-algorithm
and the individual. Second, our framework considers counterfactual outcomes,
rather than just observed outcomes, thus preventing loopholes where fairness
criteria are satisfied through self-fulfilling prophecies. We provide concrete
examples of how our counterfactual utility fairness framework resolves known
fairness issues in classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning
problems. We also show that many of the bespoke interpretations of Demographic
Parity and Equal Opportunity fit nicely as special cases of our framework.</span>

$\eta$-Massart noise setting, our algorithm achieves an
information-theoretically near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(
\frac{d}{(1-2\eta)^2} \mathrm{polylog}(\frac1\epsilon) \right)$ under a wide
range of unlabeled data distributions (specifically, the family of &quot;structured
distributions&quot; defined in Diakonikolas et al. (2020)). Under the more
challenging Tsybakov noise condition, we identify two subfamilies of noise
conditions, under which our efficient algorithm provides label complexity
guarantees strictly lower than passive learning algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Attribute-based person search is the task of finding person images that are
best matched with a set of text attributes given as query. The main challenge
of this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce
the gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the
context of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a
category of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the
two modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for
modality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person
categories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where
the distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance
of each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the
adaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically
well-arranged distributions of person images. As a consequence, it enables a
simple embedding model to achieve state-of-the-art records on public benchmarks
without bells and whistles.</span>

acknowledged challenge. For ML models to become an integral part of business
applications it is essential to detect when an ML model drifts away from
acceptable operation. However, it is often the case that actual labels are
difficult and expensive to get, for example, because they require expert
judgment. Therefore, there is a need for methods that detect likely degradation
in ML operation without labels. We propose a method that utilizes feature space
rules, called data slices, for drift detection. We provide experimental
indications that our method is likely to identify that the ML model will likely
change in performance, based on changes in the underlying data.</span>

machine learning communities recently. So far the existing research has been
mostly focusing on the development of quantitative metrics to measure algorithm
disparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the
algorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study
the problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike
existing interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we
consider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel
framework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from
fairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute
and the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the
directions on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our
framework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative
disparity measures. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data
sets are provided to show that our method can provide precise and comprehensive
explanations to the model disparities.</span>

as the task of locating the content of the image referenced by the sentence. It
is a challenging task that has several real-world applications in
human-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text
reference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this
problem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual
dependencies better than before. These models are typically constituted by two
main components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for
grounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,
respectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is
not easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to
this issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple
multi-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss
function, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered
datasets, a better learning balance between the two sub-tasks mentioned above.</span>

decisions in deep learning, and it is not an easy one. The growing literature
now lists hundreds of optimization methods. In the absence of clear theoretical
guidance and conclusive empirical evidence, the decision is often made based on
anecdotes. In this work, we aim to replace these anecdotes, if not with a
conclusive ranking, then at least with evidence-backed heuristics. To do so, we
perform an extensive, standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular
deep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of
possible choices. Analyzing more than $50,000$ individual runs, we contribute
the following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across
tasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating multiple optimizers with default
parameters works approximately as well as tuning the hyperparameters of a
single, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method
clearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced
subset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to
competitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with
newer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it. Our
open-sourced results are available as challenging and well-tuned baselines for
more meaningful evaluations of novel optimization methods without requiring any
further computational efforts.</span>

visualization from being merely a way of presentation to an analysis and
discovery tool. A given visualization result is usually generated by applying a
series of transformations or filters to the underlying data. Nowadays, such
filters use deterministic algorithms to process the data. In this work, we aim
at extending this methodology towards data-driven filters, thus filters that
expose the abilities of pre-trained machine learning models to the
visualization system. The use of such data-driven filters is of particular
interest in fields like segmentation, classification, etc., where machine
learning models regularly outperform existing algorithmic approaches. To
showcase this idea, we couple Paraview, the well-known flow visualization tool,
with PyTorch, a deep learning framework. Paraview is extended by plugins that
allow users to load pre-trained models of their choice in the form of newly
developed filters. The filters transform the input data by feeding it into the
model and then provide the model&#x27;s output as input to the remaining
visualization pipeline. A series of simplistic use cases for segmentation and
classification on image and fluid data is presented to showcase the technical
applicability of such data-driven transformations in Paraview for future
complex analysis tasks.</span>

Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces.
Despite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the
notorious deadly triad (Sutton and Barto, 2018) of off-policy RL, there are
still three open problems. First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods
proposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis
of Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected
to be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the
actual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically
suffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite
the seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some
emphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample
analysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this
paper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated
followon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces,
which depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only
finite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of
our proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.</span>

(IV) surfaces consistent with historical data by combining model-free
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with continuous time stochastic differential
equation (SDE) driven models. We focus on two classes of SDE models: regime
switching models and L\&#x27;evy additive processes. By projecting historical
surfaces onto the space of SDE model parameters, we obtain a distribution on
the parameter subspace faithful to the data on which we then train a VAE.
Arbitrage-free IV surfaces are then generated by sampling from the posterior
distribution on the latent space, decoding to obtain SDE model parameters, and
finally mapping those parameters to IV surfaces.</span>

using reinforcement learning. We consider trajectories that are conditioned to
transition between regions of configuration space in finite time, like those
relevant in the study of reactive events, as well as trajectories exhibiting
rare fluctuations of time-integrated quantities in the long time limit, like
those relevant in the calculation of large deviation functions. In both cases,
reinforcement learning techniques are used to optimize an added force that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditioned trajectory
ensemble and a driven one. Under the optimized added force, the system evolves
the rare fluctuation as a typical one, affording a variational estimate of its
likelihood in the original trajectory ensemble. Low variance gradients
employing value functions are proposed to increase the convergence of the
optimal force. The method we develop employing these gradients leads to
efficient and accurate estimates of both the optimal force and the likelihood
of the rare event for a variety of model systems.</span>

                                        <span>Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business
domain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,
it is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate
(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have
overlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the
specific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in
various business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result
in domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model
to work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to
handle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive
Recommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of
the shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared
parameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the
domain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined
prediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its
parameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result
from production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.
Since 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of
Alibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue

Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). This paper initially reviews the main
challenges in sampling from the parameter posterior of a neural network via
MCMC. Such challenges culminate to lack of convergence to the parameter
posterior. Nevertheless, this paper shows that a non-converged Markov chain,
generated via MCMC sampling from the parameter space of a neural network, can
yield via Bayesian marginalization a valuable posterior predictive distribution
of the output of the neural network. Classification examples based on
multilayer perceptrons showcase highly accurate posterior predictive
distributions. The postulate of limited scope for MCMC developments in BNNs is
partially valid; an asymptotically exact parameter posterior seems less
plausible, yet an accurate posterior predictive distribution is a tenable
research avenue.</span>

assisting perception even under complex environments. In this paper, we work
towards developing a computer vision system able to segment objects by
exploiting motion cues, i.e. motion segmentation. We make the following
contributions: First, we introduce a simple variant of the Transformer to
segment optical flow frames into primary objects and the background. Second, we
train the architecture in a self-supervised manner, i.e. without using any
manual annotations. Third, we analyze several critical components of our method
and conduct thorough ablation studies to validate their necessity. Fourth, we
evaluate the proposed architecture on public benchmarks (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2,
and FBMS59). Despite using only optical flow as input, our approach achieves
superior or comparable results to previous state-of-the-art self-supervised
methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. We additionally evaluate on
a challenging camouflage dataset (MoCA), significantly outperforming the other
self-supervised approaches, and comparing favourably to the top supervised
approach, highlighting the importance of motion cues, and the potential bias
towards visual appearance in existing video segmentation models.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, particle-based variational inference (ParVI) methods have gained
interest because they can avoid arbitrary parametric assumptions that are
common in variational inference. However, many ParVI approaches do not allow
arbitrary sampling from the posterior, and the few that do allow such sampling
suffer from suboptimality. This work proposes a new method for learning to
approximately sample from the posterior distribution. We construct a neural
sampler that is trained with the functional gradient of the KL-divergence
between the empirical sampling distribution and the target distribution,
assuming the gradient resides within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our
generative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic performance of ParVI
methods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler. Through
carefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous
generative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI
as well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting
both exactly known and intractable target distributions.</span>

                                        <span>Neural network (NN) models are increasingly used in scientific simulations,
AI, and other high performance computing (HPC) fields to extract knowledge from
datasets. Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing
structures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural
architecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS
attempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where
performance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,
accuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are
resource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for
larger and larger datasets.

To address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that
reduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without
jeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN
that plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final
accuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN
performance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We
assess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,
and SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves
substantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of
training epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a
state-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising
accuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes. First, across all our tests,
between 74% and 97% of the ground truth best models lie in our set of predicted
best models. Second, the accuracy distributions of the ground truth best models
and our predicted best models are comparable, with the mean accuracy values
differing by at most .7 percentage points across all tests.</span>

                                        <span>This work addresses the challenging task of LiDAR-based 3D object detection
in foggy weather. Collecting and annotating data in such a scenario is very
time, labor and cost intensive. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
simulating physically accurate fog into clear-weather scenes, so that the
abundant existing real datasets captured in clear weather can be repurposed for
our task. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog
simulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset. This unleashes the
acquisition of large-scale foggy training data at no extra cost. These
partially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several
perception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous
localization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments
with several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog
simulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D
object detection in the presence of fog. Thus, we are the first to provide
strong 3D object detection baselines on the Seeing Through Fog dataset. Our
code is available at www.trace.ethz.ch/lidar_fog_simulation.</span>

biological plausibility of the backpropagation algorithm. We derive our method
based upon a theoretical analysis of the (approximate) dynamics of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that the use of spike timing alone
outcompetes existing biologically plausible methods for synaptic weight
inference in spiking neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed method is
more flexible, being applicable to any spiking neuron model, is conservative in
how many parameters are required for implementation and can be deployed in an

using a distribution that maximizes entropy among those that satisfy certain
expectations&#x27; constraints. Such principle can be generalized for arbitrary
decision problems where it corresponds to minimax approaches. This paper
establishes a framework for supervised classification based on the generalized
maximum entropy principle that leads to minimax risk classifiers (MRCs). We
develop learning techniques that determine MRCs for general entropy functions
and provide performance guarantees by means of convex optimization. In
addition, we describe the relationship of the presented techniques with

models. However, current learned indexes tend to have many hyperparameters,
often do not provide any error guarantees, and are expensive to build. We
introduce Practical Learned Index (PLEX). PLEX only has a single hyperparameter
$\epsilon$ (maximum prediction error) and offers a better trade-off between
build and lookup time than state-of-the-art approaches. Similar to RadixSpline,
PLEX consists of a spline and a (multi-level) radix layer. It first builds a
spline satisfying the given $\epsilon$ and then performs an ad-hoc analysis of
the distribution of spline points to quickly tune the radix layer.</span>

cancer-related deaths in 2018. A challenge in improving treatment is resistance
in genetically unstable cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
unsupervised machine learning on classifying treatment-resistant phenotypes in
heterogeneous tumors through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq)
data with a pipeline and evaluation metrics. scRNAseq quantifies mRNA in cells
and characterizes cell phenotypes. One scRNAseq dataset was analyzed
(tumor/non-tumor cells of different molecular subtypes and patient
identifications). The pipeline consisted of data filtering, dimensionality
reduction with Principal Component Analysis, projection with Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection, clustering with nine approaches (Ward, BIRCH,
Gaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Spectral, Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative
Clustering, Mean Shift, and K-Means), and evaluation. Seven models divided
tumor versus non-tumor cells and molecular subtype while six models classified
different patient identification (13 of which were presented in the dataset);
K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH often ranked highest with ~80% accuracy on the tumor
versus non-tumor task and ~60% for molecular subtype and patient ID. An
optimized classification pipeline using K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH models was
evaluated to be most effective for further analysis. In clinical research where
there is currently no standard protocol for scRNAseq analysis, clusters
generated from this pipeline can be used to understand cancer cell behavior and
malignant growth, directly affecting the success of treatment.</span>

critical but often challenging task. Aiming to automatically learn and extract
knowledge from existing eye-tracking data, we develop a novel method that
creates rich representations of oculomotor scanpaths to facilitate the learning
of downstream tasks. The proposed stimulus-agnostic Oculomotor Behavior
Framework (OBF) model learns human oculomotor behaviors from unsupervised and
semi-supervised tasks, including reconstruction, predictive coding, fixation
identification, and contrastive learning tasks. The resultant pre-trained OBF
model can be used in a variety of applications. Our pre-trained model
outperforms baseline approaches and traditional scanpath methods in autism
spectrum disorder and viewed-stimulus classification tasks. Ablation
experiments further show our proposed method could achieve even better results
with larger model sizes and more diverse eye-tracking training datasets,
supporting the model&#x27;s potential for future eye-tracking applications. Open

                                        <span>The large and still increasing popularity of deep learning clashes with a
major limit of neural network architectures, that consists in their lack of
capability in providing human-understandable motivations of their decisions. In
situations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human
experts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial
importance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal
enough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be
understandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach
to Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures,
showing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable
deep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require
their inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide
explanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such
predicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios.
Amongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special
classifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as
additional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a
black-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning
problems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide
explanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several
datasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than
established white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists,
while providing more compact and meaningful explanations.</span>

                                        <span>There is increasing attention to evaluating the fairness of search system
ranking decisions. These metrics often consider the membership of items to
particular groups, often identified using protected attributes such as gender
or ethnicity. To date, these metrics typically assume the availability and
completeness of protected attribute labels of items. However, the protected
attributes of individuals are rarely present, limiting the application of fair
ranking metrics in large scale systems. In order to address this problem, we
propose a sampling strategy and estimation technique for four fair ranking
metrics. We formulate a robust and unbiased estimator which can operate even
with very limited number of labeled items. We evaluate our approach using both
simulated and real world data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
method can estimate this family of fair ranking metrics and provides a robust,
reliable alternative to exhaustive or random data annotation.</span>

of these methods in computer vision field. However, this progress could not
show any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this
article, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose
estimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using
pre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or
via SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of
Supervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified
versions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the
best architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.
Finally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL
pre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The
error rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,
HMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,
ImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled
images are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL
which showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial
features.</span>

with unknown positions and orientations received much less attention. In this
paper, we show how to train a neural model that can perform accurate 3D pose
and camera estimation, takes into account joint location uncertainty due
occlusion from multiple views, and requires only 2D keypoint data for training.
Our method outperforms both classical bundle adjustment and weakly-supervised

the more challenging in-the-wild Ski-Pose PTZ dataset with moving cameras. We

                                        <span>In the era of intelligent transportation, driver behavior profiling has
become a beneficial technology as it provides knowledge regarding the driver&#x27;s
aggressiveness. Previous approaches achieved promising driver behavior
profiling performance through establishing statistical heuristics rules or
supervised learning-based models. Still, there exist limits that the
practitioner should prepare a labeled dataset, and prior approaches could not
classify aggressive behaviors which are not known a priori. In pursuit of
improving the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel approach to driver
behavior profiling leveraging an unsupervised learning paradigm. First, we cast
the driver behavior profiling problem as anomaly detection. Second, we
established recurrent neural networks that predict the next feature vector
given a sequence of feature vectors. We trained the model with normal driver
data only. As a result, our model yields high regression error given a sequence
of aggressive driver behavior and low error given at a sequence of normal
driver behavior. We figured this difference of error between normal and
aggressive driver behavior can be an adequate flag for driver behavior
profiling and accomplished a precise performance in experiments. Lastly, we
further analyzed the optimal level of sequence length for identifying each
aggressive driver behavior. We expect the proposed approach to be a useful
baseline for unsupervised driver behavior profiling and contribute to the
efficient, intelligent transportation ecosystem.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial patch attack against image classification deep neural networks
(DNNs), in which the attacker can inject arbitrary distortions within a bounded
region of an image, is able to generate adversarial perturbations that are
robust (i.e., remain adversarial in physical world) and universal (i.e., remain
adversarial on any input). It is thus important to detect and mitigate such
attack to ensure the security of DNNs.

This work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and
universal adversarial patch attack. Jujutsu leverages the universal property of
the patch attack for detection. It uses explainable AI technique to identify
suspicious features that are potentially malicious, and verify their
maliciousness by transplanting the suspicious features to new images. An
adversarial patch continues to exhibit the malicious behavior on the new images
and thus can be detected based on prediction consistency. Jujutsu leverages the
localized nature of the patch attack for mitigation, by randomly masking the
suspicious features to &quot;remove&quot; adversarial perturbations. However, the network
might fail to classify the images as some of the contents are removed (masked).
Therefore, Jujutsu uses image inpainting for synthesizing alternative contents
from the pixels that are masked, which can reconstruct the &quot;clean&quot; image for
correct prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on five DNNs on two datasets, and show
that Jujutsu achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms
existing techniques. Jujutsu can further defend against various variants of the
basic attack, including 1) physical-world attack; 2) attacks that target
diverse classes; 3) attacks that use patches in different shapes and 4)
adaptive attacks.</span>

                                        <span>Development in the field of Single Board Computers (SBC) have been increasing
for several years. They provide a good balance between computing performance
and power consumption which is usually required for mobile platforms, like
application in vehicles for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Autonomous Driving (AD). However, there is an ever-increasing need of more
powerful and efficient SBCs which can run power intensive Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) in real-time and can also satisfy necessary functional safety
requirements such as Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL). ProAI is being
developed by ZF mainly to run powerful and efficient applications such as
multitask DNNs and on top of that it also has the required safety certification
for AD. In this work, we compare and discuss state of the art SBC on the basis
of power intensive multitask DNN architecture called Multitask-CenterNet with
respect to performance measures such as, FPS and power efficiency. As an
automotive supercomputer, ProAI delivers an excellent combination of
performance and efficiency, managing nearly twice the number of FPS per watt
than a modern workstation laptop and almost four times compared to the Jetson
Nano. Furthermore, it was also shown that there is still power in reserve for
further and more complex tasks on the ProAI, based on the CPU and GPU
utilization during the benchmark.</span>

features, training and deploying models, and monitoring deployed models at
scale. Feature stores were developed to manage and standardize the engineer&#x27;s
workflow in this end-to-end pipeline, focusing on traditional tabular feature
data. In recent years, however, model development has shifted towards using
self-supervised pretrained embeddings as model features. Managing these
embeddings and the downstream systems that use them introduces new challenges
with respect to managing embedding training data, measuring embedding quality,
and monitoring downstream models that use embeddings. These challenges are
largely unaddressed in standard feature stores. Our goal in this tutorial is to
introduce the feature store system and discuss the challenges and current
solutions to managing these new embedding-centric pipelines.</span>

                                        <span>Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.
However, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank
models is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).
Thus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important
research field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can
be generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with
logged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by
estimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online
learning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a
unified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging
for researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people
who are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve
this problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily
configure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR
algorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click
models that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model
architecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline
creation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly
describe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the
toolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed
that the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important
resource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with
different configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the
supported features.</span>

Without a proper analyse, the data are usually useless. The field of analysing
the data is called data mining. Unfortunately, the amount of data is quite
large: the data do not fit into main memory and the processing time can become
quite huge. Therefore, we need parallel data mining algorithms. One of the
popular and important data mining algorithm is the algorithm for generation of
so called frequent itemsets. The problem of mining of frequent itemsets can be
explained on the following example: customers goes in a store put into theirs
baskets some goods; the owner of the store collects the baskets and wants to
know the set of goods that are bought together in at least p% of the baskets.
Currently, the sequential algorithms for mining of frequent itemsets are quite
good in the means of performance. However, the parallel algorithms for mining
of frequent itemsets still do not achieve good speedup. In this thesis, we
develop a parallel method for mining of frequent itemsets that can be used for
an arbitrary depth first search sequential algorithms on a distributed memory
parallel computer. Our method achieves speedup of ~ 6 on 10 processors. The
method is based on an approximate estimation of processor load from a database
sample - however it always computes the set of frequent itemsets from the whole
database. In this thesis, we show a theory underlying our method and show the
performance of the estimation process.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance
verification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark
removal attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance
verification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been
proposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a
relatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation
of these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This
uncertainty about a watermarking scheme&#x27;s robustness causes difficulty to trust
their deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently
proposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large
set of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are
known removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated
as removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth
retraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes
surveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and
removal attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets
of parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is
robust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and
known methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as
removal attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently
evaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a
more extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.
Our source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly
available, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.</span>

particular case of a much more general statement according to which, randomly
generated linear state-space representations of generic observations of an
invertible dynamical system carry in their wake an embedding of the phase space
dynamics into the chosen Euclidean state space. This embedding coincides with a
natural generalized synchronization that arises in this setup and that yields a
topological conjugacy between the state-space dynamics driven by the generic
observations of the dynamical system and the dynamical system itself. This
result provides additional tools for the representation, learning, and analysis
of chaotic attractors and sheds additional light on the reservoir computing

tasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial
perturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application
of a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical
imaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a
black-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are
accessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms
for generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries
can access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate
that UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under
black-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs
using a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate
the validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical
image classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted
and targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success
rates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates
because the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The
vulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.
The results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple
procedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical
image diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.</span>

                                        <span>State of the art (SOTA) few-shot learning (FSL) methods suffer significant
performance drop in the presence of domain differences between source and
target datasets. The strong discrimination ability on the source dataset does
not necessarily translate to high classification accuracy on the target
dataset. In this work, we address this cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)
problem by boosting the generalization capability of the model. Specifically,
we teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions
with a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE). NSAE trains the
model by jointly reconstructing inputs and predicting the labels of inputs as
well as their reconstructed pairs. Theoretical analysis based on intra-class
correlation (ICC) shows that the feature embeddings learned from NSAE have
stronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We
also take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning
procedure that achieves better adaption and improves classification performance
in the target domain. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted

Among various such mobile billboards, taxicab rooftop devices are emerging in
the market as a brand new media. Motov is a leading company in South Korea in
the taxicab rooftop advertising market. In this work, we present a lightweight
yet accurate deep learning-based method to predict taxicabs&#x27; next locations to
better prepare for targeted advertising based on demographic information of
locations. Considering the fact that next POI recommendation datasets are
frequently sparse, we design our presented model based on neural ordinary
differential equations (NODEs), which are known to be robust to
sparse/incorrect input, with several enhancements. Our model, which we call
LightMove, has a larger prediction accuracy, a smaller number of parameters,
and/or a smaller training/inference time, when evaluating with various
datasets, in comparison with state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Autonomous driving in multi-agent and dynamic traffic scenarios is
challenging, where the behaviors of other road agents are uncertain and hard to
model explicitly, and the ego-vehicle should apply complicated negotiation
skills with them to achieve both safe and efficient driving in various
settings, such as giving way, merging and taking turns. Traditional planning
methods are largely rule-based and scale poorly in these complex dynamic
scenarios, often leading to reactive or even overly conservative behaviors.
Therefore, they require tedious human efforts to maintain workability.
Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results with better
generalization capability but less hand engineering effort. However, they are
either implemented with supervised imitation learning (IL) that suffers from
the dataset bias and distribution mismatch problems, or trained with deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) but focus on one specific traffic scenario. In
this work, we propose DQ-GAT to achieve scalable and proactive autonomous
driving, where graph attention-based networks are used to implicitly model
interactions, and asynchronous deep Q-learning is employed to train the network
end-to-end in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments through a
high-fidelity driving simulation show that our method can better trade-off
safety and efficiency in both seen and unseen scenarios, achieving higher goal
success rates than the baselines (at most 4.7$\times$) with comparable task
completion time. Demonstration videos are available at

                                        <span>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal
neurodegenerative disease, that causes approximately 350 deaths in the United
States every year. In specific, it is a prion disease that is caused by a
misfolded prion protein, termed $PrP^{Sc}$, which is the infectious form of the
prion protein $PrP^{C}$. Rather than being recycled by the body, the $PrP^{Sc}$
aggregates in the brain as plaques, leading to neurodegeneration of surrounding
cells and the spongiform characteristics of the pathology. However, there has
been very little research done into factors that can affect one&#x27;s chances of
acquiring $PrP^{Sc}$. In this paper, Elastic Net Regression, Long Short-Term
Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures, and Random Forest have been used
to predict Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Levels in the United States. New variables
were created as data for the models to use on the basis of common factors that
are known to affect CJD, such as soil, food, and water quality. Based on the
root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error
(MAE) values, the study reveals the high impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices,
CO$_{2}$ Levels, Pesticide Usage, and Potash K$_{2}$O Usage on CJD Levels. In
doing so, the study highlights new avenues of research for CJD prevention and
detection, as well as potential causes.</span>

extending the functional diversity of proteins and effect meaningfully the
regulation of protein functions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. PTMs
have happened as crucial molecular regulatory mechanisms that are utilized to
regulate diverse cellular processes. Nevertheless, among the most well-studied
PTMs can say mainly types of proteins are containing phosphorylation and
significant roles in many biological processes. Disorder in this modification
can be caused by multiple diseases including neurological disorders and
cancers. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the phosphorylation of target
residues in an uncharacterized amino acid sequence. Most experimental
techniques for predicting phosphorylation are time-consuming, costly, and
error-prone. By the way, computational methods have replaced these techniques.
These days, a vast amount of phosphorylation data is publicly accessible
through many online databases. In this study, at first, all datasets of PTMs
that include phosphorylation sites (p-sites) were comprehensively reviewed.
Furthermore, we showed that there are basically two main approaches for
phosphorylation prediction by machine learning: End-to-End and conventional. We
gave an overview for both of them. Also, we introduced 15 important feature

learning methods</span>

sequence modeling. Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity
w.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes
information at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same
resolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this,
we propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution
Attention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms
of time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head
attention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual
information in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential
relations between query representation and clues of different attention
granularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to
query, which further improves the model&#x27;s capacity compared to vanilla
Transformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention
without degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a
state-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA
utilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made

(LiNGAM) that determines the causal order among variables from a dataset when
the variables are expressed by a set of linear equations, including noise. In
particular, we assume that the variables are binary. The existing LiNGAM
assumes that no confounding is present, which is restrictive in practice. Based
on the concept of independent component analysis (ICA), this paper proposes an
extended framework in which the mutual information among the noises is
minimized. Another significant contribution is to reduce the realization of the
shortest path problem. The distance between each pair of nodes expresses an
associated mutual information value, and the path with the minimum sum (KL
divergence) is sought. Although $p!$ mutual information values should be
compared, this paper dramatically reduces the computation when no confounding
is present. The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution, while
the existing locally greedily seek the order based on hypothesis testing. We
use the best estimator in the sense of Bayes/MDL that correctly detects
independence for mutual information estimation. Experiments using artificial
and actual data show that the proposed version of LiNGAM achieves significantly
better performance, particularly when confounding is present.</span>

researchers in the area primarily rely on UCI Adult when it comes to tabular
data. Derived from a 1994 US Census survey, this dataset has appeared in
hundreds of research papers where it served as the basis for the development
and comparison of many algorithmic fairness interventions. We reconstruct a
superset of the UCI Adult data from available US Census sources and reveal
idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our
primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys
that extend the existing data ecosystem for research on fair machine learning.
We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health,
transportation, and housing. The data span multiple years and all states of the
United States, allowing researchers to study temporal shift and geographic
variation. We highlight a broad initial sweep of new empirical insights
relating to trade-offs between fairness criteria, performance of algorithmic
interventions, and the role of distribution shift based on our new datasets.

                                        <span>Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in
shaping people&#x27;s health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative
effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially
cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical
analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies
to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured
SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much
of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language
processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from
unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system
focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art
transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH
concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract
SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the
difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured
EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the
International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show
that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of
0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH
information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864
patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more
detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only
captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical
narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of
patients&#x27; SBDoH factors.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of learning a Hamiltonian $H$ to precision
$\varepsilon$, supposing we are given copies of its Gibbs state
$\rho&#x3D;\exp(-\beta H)/\operatorname{Tr}(\exp(-\beta H))$ at a known inverse
temperature $\beta$. Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar (Nature
Physics, 2021) recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of
$\rho$ needed) of this problem for geometrically local $N$-qubit Hamiltonians.
In the high-temperature (low $\beta$) regime, their algorithm has sample
complexity poly$(N, 1/\beta,1/\varepsilon)$ and can be implemented with
polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity.

In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of
Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error
$\varepsilon$ with sample complexity $S &#x3D; O(\log N/(\beta\varepsilon)^{2})$ and
time complexity linear in the sample size, $O(S N)$. Furthermore, we prove a
matching lower bound showing that our algorithm&#x27;s sample complexity is optimal,
and hence our time complexity is also optimal.

In the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to
learn $H$ from a real-time evolution unitary $e^{-it H}$ in a small $t$ regime
with similar sample and time complexity.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we present a spectral-based approach to study the linear
approximation of two-layer neural networks. We first consider the case of
single neuron and show that the linear approximability, quantified by the
Kolmogorov width, is controlled by the eigenvalue decay of an associate kernel.
Then, we show that similar results also hold for two-layer neural networks.
This spectral-based approach allows us to obtain upper bounds, lower bounds,
and explicit hard examples in a united manner. In particular, these bounds
imply that for networks activated by smooth functions, restricting the norms of
inner-layer weights may significantly impair the expressiveness. By contrast,
for non-smooth activation functions, such as ReLU, the network expressiveness
is independent of the inner-layer weight norms. In addition, we prove that for
a family of non-smooth activation functions, including ReLU, approximating any
single neuron with random features suffers from the \emph{curse of
dimensionality}. This provides an explicit separation of expressiveness between
neural networks and random feature models.</span>

the observed data. Given the fact that the generative distribution may be
complex and intractable, deep latent variable models use probabilistic
frameworks to learn more expressive joint probability distributions over the
data and their low-dimensional hidden variables. Learning complex probability
distributions over sequential data without any supervision is a difficult task
for deep generative models. Ordinary Differential Equation Variational
Auto-Encoder (ODE2VAE) is a deep latent variable model that aims to learn
complex distributions over high-dimensional sequential data and their
low-dimensional representations. ODE2VAE infers continuous latent dynamics of
the high-dimensional input in a low-dimensional hierarchical latent space. The
hierarchical organization of the continuous latent space embeds a
physics-guided inductive bias in the model. In this paper, we analyze the
latent representations inferred by the ODE2VAE model over three different
physical motion datasets: bouncing balls, projectile motion, and simple
pendulum. Through our experiments, we explore the effects of the physics-guided
inductive bias of the ODE2VAE model over the learned dynamical latent
representations. We show that the model is able to learn meaningful latent
representations to an extent without any supervision.</span>

                                        <span>Nonlocal models, including peridynamics, often use integral operators that
embed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these
operators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available
for a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In
contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it
suffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can
address. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a
coarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately
captures materials&#x27; behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from
MD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD
displacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the
peridynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the
well-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient
well-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing
influence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that
minimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.
This framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically
well-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings
that are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer
graphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed
algorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain
shapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from
the ones used for training.</span>

                                        <span>Growing evidence from recent studies implies that microRNA or miRNA could
serve as biomarkers in various complex human diseases. Since wet-lab
experiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational techniques for
miRNA-disease association prediction have attracted a lot of attention in
recent years. Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable
machine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of pre-calculated
hand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data
leakage.

We overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel
multi-tasking convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD
allows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from 4
heterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between
miRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), miRNA family information, and
disease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has
not been studied before. The use of multi-channel convolutions allows us to
extract expressive representations while keeping the model linear and,
therefore, simple. To effectively test the generalization capability of our
model, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as
well as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD
shows an improvement of at least 5% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and
HMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 49% on larger independent test sets with unseen
miRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches. We share our code for
reproducibility and future research at

                                        <span>Light-induced chemical processes are ubiquitous in nature and have widespread
technological applications. For example, the photoisomerization of azobenzene
allows a drug with an azo scaffold to be activated with light. In principle,
photoswitches with useful reactive properties, such as high isomerization
yields, can be identified through virtual screening with reactive simulations.
In practice these simulations are rarely used for screening, since they require
hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum chemical methods to account for
non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we introduce a neural network
potential to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives. The model,
which is based on diabatic states, is called the \textit{diabatic artificial
neural network} (DANN). The network is six orders of magnitude faster than the
quantum chemistry method used for training. DANN is transferable to molecules
outside the training set, predicting quantum yields for unseen species that are
correlated with experiment. We use the model to virtually screen 3,100
hypothetical molecules, and identify several species with extremely high
quantum yields. Our results pave the way for fast and accurate virtual
screening of photoactive compounds.</span>

detection that realizes a well-known SVDD principle using deep learning tools.
Contrary to other approaches to deep SVDD, the proposed model is instantiated

                                        <span>Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe
operation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly
dynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be
used to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity
sensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind
spots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the
phenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and
present AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the
first system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It
requires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be
applied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further
introduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural
network to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity
sensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single
piezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.
We conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000
on-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,
colliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns. AuraSense
achieves 100% and 95.3% true positive proximity detection rates when the arm
approaches static and mobile obstacles respectively, with a true negative rate
over 99%, showing the real-world viability of this system.</span>

node features for attributed graph, we introduce self-supervised learning
mechanism to graph representation learning and propose a novel Self-supervised
Consensus Representation Learning (SCRL) framework. In contrast to most
existing works that only explore one graph, our proposed SCRL method treats
graph from two perspectives: topology graph and feature graph. We argue that
their embeddings should share some common information, which could serve as a
supervisory signal. Specifically, we construct the feature graph of node
features via k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Then graph convolutional network
(GCN) encoders extract features from two graphs respectively. Self-supervised
loss is designed to maximize the agreement of the embeddings of the same node
in the topology graph and the feature graph. Extensive experiments on real
citation networks and social networks demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed SCRL over the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node
classification task. Meanwhile, compared with its main competitors, SCRL is
rather efficient.</span>

black-box model predictions by tabular data is proposed. It is implemented as a
system called AFEX (Attention-like Feature EXplanation) and consisting of two
main parts. The first part is a set of the one-feature neural subnetworks which
aim to get a specific representation for every feature in the form of a basis
of shape functions. The subnetworks use shortcut connections with trainable
parameters to improve the network performance. The second part of AFEX produces
shape functions of features as the weighted sum of the basis shape functions
where weights are computed by using an attention-like mechanism. AFEX
identifies pairwise interactions between features based on pairwise
multiplications of shape functions corresponding to different features. A
modification of AFEX with incorporating an additional surrogate model which
approximates the black-box model is proposed. AFEX is trained end-to-end on a
whole dataset only once such that it does not require to train neural networks
again in the explanation stage. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real
data illustrate AFEX.</span>

                                        <span>Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become increasingly more
complex and widespread. With recent developments in neural networks, a growing
concern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as
safety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.
Furthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for
accountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these
explanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is
understandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey
provides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate
explanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey
focuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is
learned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of
methods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc
methods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes a new self-attention based model for music score
infilling, i.e., to generate a polyphonic music sequence that fills in the gap
between given past and future contexts. While existing approaches can only fill
in a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between
the past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes
(up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical
contributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally
proposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second,
we propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar
encoding that better informs the model of notes&#x27; position within the past and
future context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform
look-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before
predicting the other attributes of the note. We compare our proposed model with
two strong baselines and show that our model is superior in both objective and
subjective analyses.</span>

box filter is well-known. However, box filter can not keep some features of the
signal, such as edges, corners and the jump in the step function. In this
paper, we present a one-sided box filter that can smooth the signal but keep
the discontinuous features in the signal. More specifically, we perform box
filter on eight one-sided windows, leading to a one-sided box filter that can
preserve corners and edges. Our filter inherits the constant $O(1)$
computational complexity of the original box filter with respect to the window
size and also the linear $O(N)$ computational complexity with respect to the
total number of samples. We performance several experiments to show the
efficiency and effectiveness of this filter. We further compare our filter with
other the-state-of-the-art edge preserving methods. Our filter can be deployed
in a large range of applications where the classical box filter is adopted.</span>

                                        <span>Binaural audio gives the listener the feeling of being in the recording place
and enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR. But the problem
with binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is
not possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional
mono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome
this drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to
binaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But
all the prior approaches missed other most important information required for
the task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording
setup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a
proxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that
adding depth features along with image features improves the performance both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We propose a novel encoder-decoder
architecture, where we use a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode the
image and depth feature extracted from individual transformer backbone, with
audio features at each layer of the decoder.</span>

in voice assistant interaction, but are challenging due to the special
difficulties associated with spoken user queries. In this paper, we propose a
novel architecture that jointly solves the NER and EL tasks by combining them
in a joint reranking module. We show that our proposed framework improves NER

COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the public response, there is a need to
explore public opinion. Traditional surveys are expensive and time-consuming,
address limited health topics, and obtain small-scale data. Twitter can provide
a great opportunity to understand public opinion regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
The current study proposes an approach using computational and human coding
methods to collect and analyze a large number of tweets to provide a wider
perspective on the COVID-19 vaccine. This study identifies the sentiment of
tweets and their temporal trend, discovers major topics, compares topics of
negative and non-negative tweets, and discloses top topics of negative and
non-negative tweets. Our findings show that the negative sentiment regarding
the COVID-19 vaccine had a decreasing trend between November 2020 and February
2021. We found Twitter users have discussed a wide range of topics from
vaccination sites to the 2020 U.S. election between November 2020 and February
2021. The findings show that there was a significant difference between
negative and non-negative tweets regarding the weight of most topics. Our
results also indicate that the negative and non-negative tweets had different
topic priorities and focuses.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a headed span-based method for projective dependency parsing. In a
projective tree, the subtree rooted at each word occurs in a contiguous
sequence (i.e., span) in the surface order, we call the span-headword pair
\textit{headed span}. In this view, a projective tree can be regarded as a
collection of headed spans. It is similar to the case in constituency parsing
since a constituency tree can be regarded as a collection of constituent spans.
Span-based methods decompose the score of a constituency tree sorely into the
score of constituent spans and use the CYK algorithm for global training and
exact inference, obtaining state-of-the-art results in constituency parsing.
Inspired by them, we decompose the score of a dependency tree into the score of
headed spans. We use neural networks to score headed spans and design a novel
$O(n^3)$ dynamic programming algorithm to enable global training and exact
inference. We evaluate our method on PTB, CTB, and UD, achieving
state-of-the-art or comparable results.</span>

using data-driven approaches. However, most existing work does not examine the
actual joke mechanism to understand humor. We break down any joke into two
distinct components: the set-up and the punchline, and further explore the
special relationship between them. Inspired by the incongruity theory of humor,
we model the set-up as the part developing semantic uncertainty, and the
punchline disrupting audience expectations. With increasingly powerful language
models, we were able to feed the set-up along with the punchline into the GPT-2
language model, and calculate the uncertainty and surprisal values of the
jokes. By conducting experiments on the SemEval 2021 Task 7 dataset, we found
that these two features have better capabilities of telling jokes from
non-jokes, compared with existing baselines.</span>

hope speech detection. The approach achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.756,
bettering other models. Henceforth, KanHope aims to instigate research in
Kannada while broadly promoting researchers to take a pragmatic approach

                                        <span>Understanding documents from their visual snapshots is an emerging problem
that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods. The recent advance
in OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still
challenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of
their layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the
importance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of
texts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for
understanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement
considering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained
language model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes
the information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.
Specifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions
and learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking
strategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial
layout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under
low-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can
be combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order
information between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public
benchmarks---FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR---and its robustness in practical
cases where order information of text blocks is not available. Further
experiments with a varying number of training examples demonstrate the high
training efficiency of our approach. Our code will be open to the public.</span>

                                        <span>People convey information extremely effectively through spoken interaction
using multiple channels of information transmission: the lexical channel of
what is said, and the non-lexical channel of how it is said. We propose
studying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better
understand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the
question &#x27;What characteristics of communicative context affect listener&#x27;s
expectations of speech?&#x27;. To investigate this, we present a novel behavioural
task testing whether listeners can discriminate between the true utterance in a
dialogue and utterances sampled from other contexts with the same lexical
content. We characterize how perception - and subsequent discriminative
capability - is affected by different degrees of additional contextual
information across both the lexical and non-lexical channel of speech. Results
demonstrate that people can effectively discriminate between different prosodic
realisations, that non-lexical context is informative, and that this channel
provides more salient information than the lexical channel, highlighting the
importance of the non-lexical channel in spoken interaction.</span>

relies on a fixed dataset and a predefined set of intent classes. However, in
real-world applications, online systems usually involve continually emerging
new user intents, which pose a great challenge to the offline training
paradigm. Recently, lifelong learning has received increasing attention and is
considered to be the most promising solution to this challenge. In this paper,
we propose Lifelong Intent Detection (LID), which continually trains an ID
model on new data to learn newly emerging intents while avoiding
catastrophically forgetting old data. Nevertheless, we find that existing
lifelong learning methods usually suffer from a serious imbalance between old
and new data in the LID task. Therefore, we propose a novel lifelong learning
method, Multi-Strategy Rebalancing (MSR), which consists of cosine
normalization, hierarchical knowledge distillation, and inter-class margin loss
to alleviate the multiple negative effects of the imbalance problem.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods
on the ATIS, SNIPS, HWU64, and CLINC150 benchmarks.</span>

articles and then downloads contents of the same post from the respective
social media platform to gather details about that specific post. The framework
is capable of fetching the annotated data from multiple platforms like Twitter,
YouTube, Reddit. The framework aims to reduce the workload and problems behind
the data annotation from the social media platforms. AMUSED can be applied in
multiple application domains, as a use case, we have implemented the framework
for collecting COVID-19 misinformation data from different social media
platforms.</span>

                                        <span>Pre-trained models for programming languages have proven their significant
values in various code-related tasks, such as code search, code clone
detection, and code translation. Currently, most pre-trained models treat a
code snippet as a sequence of tokens or only focus on the data flow between
code identifiers. However, rich code syntax and hierarchy are ignored which can
provide important structure information and semantic rules of codes to help
enhance code representations. In addition, although the BERT-based code
pre-trained models achieve high performance on many downstream tasks, the
native derived sequence representations of BERT are proven to be of
low-quality, it performs poorly on code matching and similarity tasks. To
address these problems, we propose CLSEBERT, a Constrastive Learning Framework
for Syntax Enhanced Code Pre-Trained Model, to deal with various code
intelligence tasks. In the pre-training stage, we consider the code syntax and
hierarchy contained in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and leverage the
constrastive learning to learn noise-invariant code representations. Besides
the masked language modeling (MLM), we also introduce two novel pre-training
objectives. One is to predict the edges between nodes in the abstract syntax
tree, and the other is to predict the types of code tokens. Through extensive
experiments on four code intelligence tasks, we successfully show the
effectiveness of our proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>In neural machine translation (NMT), we search for the mode of the model
distribution to form predictions. The mode as well as other high probability
translations found by beam search have been shown to often be inadequate in a
number of ways. This prevents practitioners from improving translation quality
through better search, as these idiosyncratic translations end up being
selected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search curse.
Recently, a sampling-based approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding
has been proposed as an alternative decision rule for NMT that would likely not
suffer from the same problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that
it has no equivalent to the beam search curse, i.e. better search always leads
to better translations. We also design different approximations aimed at
decoupling the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of
expected utility. This allows for exploration of much larger hypothesis spaces,
which we show to be beneficial. We also show that it can be beneficial to make
use of strategies like beam search and nucleus sampling to construct hypothesis
spaces efficiently. We show on three language pairs (English into and from
German, Romanian, and Nepali) that MBR can improve upon beam search with
moderate computation.</span>

independently attend to different parts of the input, is the key ingredient in
the Transformer (Vaswaniet al., 2017). Recent work has shown, however, that a
large proportion of the heads in a Transformer&#x27;s multi-head attention mechanism
can be safely pruned away without significantly harming the performance of the
model; such pruning leads to models that are noticeably smaller and faster in
practice. Our work introduces a new head pruning technique that we term
differentiable subset pruning. Intuitively, our method learns per-head
importance variables and then enforces a user-specified hard constraint on the
number of unpruned heads. The importance variables are learned via stochastic
gradient descent. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and
machine translation; we show that differentiable subset pruning performs
comparably or better than Voita et al. (2019) while offering the same exact

                                        <span>Point cloud completion aims to predict a complete shape in high accuracy from
its partial observation. However, previous methods usually suffered from
discrete nature of point cloud and unstructured prediction of points in local
regions, which makes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details on the
complete shape. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake
Point Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The
SnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the
snowflake-like growth of points in 3D space, where the child points are
progressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our
insight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD
to learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best.
Skip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting
patterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current
SPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is
able to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local
patches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such
as smooth regions, sharp edges and corners. Our experimental results outperform
the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods under widely used
benchmarks. Code will be available at

has been proven to be an effective way to perform robust object tracking. This
paper focuses on effectively representing and utilizing complementary features
from the frame domain and event domain for boosting object tracking performance
in challenge scenarios. Specifically, we propose Common Features Extractor
(CFE) to learn potential common representations from the RGB domain and event
domain. For learning the unique features of the two domains, we utilize a
Unique Extractor for Event (UEE) based on Spiking Neural Networks to extract
edge cues in the event domain which may be missed in RGB in some challenging
conditions, and a Unique Extractor for RGB (UER) based on Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks to extract texture and semantic information in RGB domain.
Extensive experiments on standard RGB benchmark and real event tracking dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We show our approach
outperforms all compared state-of-the-art tracking algorithms and verify
event-based data is a powerful cue for tracking in challenging scenes.</span>

to recover object variation in 3D space from a single image, trained on an
image collection without using any ground-truth 3D annotation. We accomplish
this by representing an object as a composition of 3D shape and its appearance,
while eliminating the effect of camera viewpoint, in a canonical configuration.
Unlike conventional methods modeling spatial variation in 2D images only, our
method is capable of reconfiguring the appearance feature in a canonical 3D
space, thus enabling the subsequent object classifier to be invariant under 3D
geometric variation. Our representation also allows us to go beyond existing
methods, by incorporating 3D shape variation as an additional cue for object
recognition. To learn the model without ground-truth 3D annotation, we deploy a
differentiable renderer in an analysis-by-synthesis framework. By incorporating
3D shape and appearance jointly in a deep representation, our method learns the
discriminative representation of the object and achieves competitive
performance on fine-grained image recognition and vehicle re-identification. We
also demonstrate that the performance of 3D shape reconstruction is improved by
learning fine-grained shape deformation in a boosting manner.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce the problem of multi-camera trajectory forecasting (MCTF), which
involves predicting the trajectory of a moving object across a network of
cameras. While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as
surveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods
typically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their
use for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the
field-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We
address these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that
simultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several
viewpoints and predicts the object&#x27;s future location in all possible
viewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in
which camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views
they appear. To this end, we propose the concept of trajectory tensors: a new
technique to encode trajectories across multiple camera views and the
associated uncertainties. We develop several encoder-decoder MCTF models for
trajectory tensors and present extensive experiments on our own database
(comprising 600 hours of video data from 15 camera views) created particularly
for the MCTF task. Results show that our trajectory tensor models outperform
coordinate trajectory-based MCTF models and existing SCTF methods adapted for
MCTF. Code is available from: https://github.com/olly-styles/Trajectory-Tensors</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes a novel model for recognizing images with composite
attribute-object concepts, notably for composite concepts that are unseen
during model training. We aim to explore the three key properties required by
the task --- relation-aware, consistent, and decoupled --- to learn rich and
robust features for primitive concepts that compose attribute-object pairs. To
this end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model
consists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful
features for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual
features for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing
mechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between
primitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards
seen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and
objects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information
available to the model for both seen and unseen concepts. Extensive experiments
and ablation studies on two benchmarks show the efficacy of the proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>Touchless computer interaction has become an important consideration during
the COVID-19 pandemic period. Despite progress in machine learning and computer
vision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection
of such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them
in a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still
missing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application. This
application utilises published open-source libraries and additional gesture
definitions developed to take the video stream from a standard RGB webcam as
input. It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing
applications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of
interacting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand
gesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial
movements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a
series of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers,
including gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D
RGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions,
winking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the
development of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software,
and gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated
and provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and
keyboard controls in Windows via DirectX. With ease of access to webcams
integrated into most laptops and desktop computers, touchless computing becomes
more available with MotionInput v2.0, in a federated and locally processed
method.</span>

                                        <span>Classical close-set semantic segmentation networks have limited ability to
detect out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, which is important for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Incrementally learning
these OOD objects with few annotations is an ideal way to enlarge the knowledge
base of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an open world
semantic segmentation system that includes two modules: (1) an open-set
semantic segmentation module to detect both in-distribution and OOD objects.
(2) an incremental few-shot learning module to gradually incorporate those OOD
objects into its existing knowledge base. This open world semantic segmentation
system behaves like a human being, which is able to identify OOD objects and
gradually learn them with corresponding supervision. We adopt the Deep Metric
Learning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive clustering to implement open-set
semantic segmentation. Compared to other open-set semantic segmentation
methods, our DMLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging
open-set semantic segmentation datasets without using additional data or
generative models. On this basis, two incremental few-shot learning methods are
further proposed to progressively improve the DMLNet with the annotations of
OOD objects.</span>

                                        <span>Current 3D single object tracking approaches track the target based on a
feature comparison between the target template and the search area. However,
due to the common occlusion in LiDAR scans, it is non-trivial to conduct
accurate feature comparisons on severe sparse and incomplete shapes. In this
work, we exploit the ground truth bounding box given in the first frame as a
strong cue to enhance the feature description of the target object, enabling a
more accurate feature comparison in a simple yet effective way. In particular,
we first propose the BoxCloud, an informative and robust representation, to
depict an object using the point-to-box relation. We further design an
efficient box-aware feature fusion module, which leverages the aforementioned
BoxCloud for reliable feature matching and embedding. Integrating the proposed
general components into an existing model P2B, we construct a superior
box-aware tracker (BAT). Experiments confirm that our proposed BAT outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin on both KITTI and NuScenes
benchmarks, achieving a 12.8% improvement in terms of precision while running
~20% faster.</span>

machine learning in medical imaging. We start with a short summary of the
general developments of the past in machine learning and how general and
specialized approaches have been in competition in the past decades. A
particular focus will be the theoretical and experimental evidence pro and
contra hybrid modelling. Next, we inspect several new developments regarding
hybrid machine learning with a particular focus on so-called known operator
learning and how hybrid approaches gain more and more momentum across
essentially all applications in medical imaging and medical image analysis. As
we will point out by numerous examples, hybrid models are taking over in image
reconstruction and analysis. Even domains such as physical simulation and
scanner and acquisition design are being addressed using machine learning grey
box modelling approaches. Towards the end of the article, we will investigate a
few future directions and point out relevant areas in which hybrid modelling,
meta learning, and other domains will likely be able to drive the
state-of-the-art ahead.</span>

                                        <span>Background and Aim: Recently, deep learning using convolutional neural
network has been used successfully to classify the images of breast cells
accurately. However, the accuracy of manual classification of those
histopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase
the accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a
Patch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.
Methodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural
Network (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the
classification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier
(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through
convolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the
max-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.
Further, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists
of patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The
results are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer
images that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution
improves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,
benign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in
processing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average. Conclusion: The proposed
solution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast
by enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient. Finally,
this solution for the implementation of the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE) technique and modified tangent function helps in
increasing the accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding and comprehending video content is crucial for many real-world
applications such as search and recommendation systems. While recent progress
of deep learning has boosted performance on various tasks using visual cues,
deep cognition to reason intentions, motivation, or causality remains
challenging. Existing datasets that aim to examine video reasoning capability
focus on visual signals such as actions, objects, relations, or could be
answered utilizing text bias. Observing this, we propose a novel task, along
with a new dataset: Trope Understanding in Movies and Animations (TrUMAn),
intending to evaluate and develop learning systems beyond visual signals.
Tropes are frequently used storytelling devices for creative works. By coping
with the trope understanding task and enabling the deep cognition skills of
machines, we are optimistic that data mining applications and algorithms could
be taken to the next level. To tackle the challenging TrUMAn dataset, we
present a Trope Understanding and Storytelling (TrUSt) with a new Conceptual
Storyteller module, which guides the video encoder by performing video
storytelling on a latent space. The generated story embedding is then fed into
the trope understanding model to provide further signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art learning systems on existing tasks reach only
12.01% of accuracy with raw input signals. Also, even in the oracle case with
human-annotated descriptions, BERT contextual embedding achieves at most 28% of
accuracy. Our proposed TrUSt boosts the model performance and reaches 13.94%
performance. We also provide detailed analysis topave the way for future
research. TrUMAn is publicly available

best matched with a set of text attributes given as query. The main challenge
of this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce
the gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the
context of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a
category of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the
two modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for
modality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person
categories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where
the distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance
of each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the
adaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically
well-arranged distributions of person images. As a consequence, it enables a
simple embedding model to achieve state-of-the-art records on public benchmarks
without bells and whistles.</span>

blood cell classification is one of the interesting and promising area of
research. The classification of the white blood cells plays an important part
in the medical diagnosis. In practise white blood cell classification is
performed by the haematologist by taking a small smear of blood and careful
examination under the microscope. The current procedures to identify the white
blood cell subtype is more time taking and error-prone. The computer aided
detection and diagnosis of the white blood cells tend to avoid the human error
and reduce the time taken to classify the white blood cells. In the recent
years several deep learning approaches have been developed in the context of
classification of the white blood cells that are able to identify but are
unable to localize the positions of white blood cells in the blood cell image.
Following this, the present research proposes to utilize YOLOv3 object
detection technique to localize and classify the white blood cells with
bounding boxes. With exhaustive experimental analysis, the proposed work is
found to detect the white blood cell with 99.2% accuracy and classify with 90%
accuracy.</span>

imagery(on NASA Worldview) in order to develop datasets on which they can start
conducting research. We developed an interactive, scalable and fast image
similarity search engine (which can take one or more images as the query image)
that automatically sifts through the unlabeled dataset reducing dataset
generation time from weeks to minutes. In this work, we describe key components
of the end to end pipeline. Our similarity search system was created to be able
to identify similar images from a potentially petabyte scale database that are
similar to an input image, and for this we had to break down each query image
into its features, which were generated by a classification layer stripped CNN
trained in a supervised manner. To store and search these features efficiently,
we had to make several scalability improvements. To improve the speed, reduce
the storage, and shrink memory requirements for embedding search, we add a
fully connected layer to our CNN make all images into a 128 length vector
before entering the classification layers. This helped us compress the size of
our image features from 2048 (for ResNet, which was initially tried as our
featurizer) to 128 for our new custom model. Additionally, we utilize existing
approximate nearest neighbor search libraries to significantly speed up
embedding search. Our system currently searches over our entire database of
images at 5 seconds per query on a single virtual machine in the cloud. In the
future, we would like to incorporate a SimCLR based featurizing model which
could be trained without any labelling by a human (since the classification
aspect of the model is irrelevant to this use case).</span>

scarcity of abnormal events andthe difficulty of accurately annotating them.To
allevi-ate these issues, unsupervised learning-based predictionmethods have
been previously applied. These approachestrain the model with only normal
events and predict a fu-ture frame from a sequence of preceding frames by use
ofencoder-decoder architectures so that they result in smallprediction errors
on normal events but large errors on ab-normal events. The architecture,
however, comes with thecomputational burden as some anomaly detection tasks
re-quire low computational cost without sacrificing perfor-mance. In this
paper, Cross-Parallel Network (CPNet) forefficient anomaly detection is
proposed here to minimizecomputations without performance drops. It consists
ofNsmaller parallel U-Net, each of which is designed to handlea single input
frame, to make the calculations significantlymore efficient. Additionally, an
inter-network shift moduleis incorporated to capture temporal relationships
among se-quential frames to enable more accurate future predictions.The

low-rankness (STDLR) in k-space data is incorporated into SPIRiT to realize
improved reconstruction. Recent methods have exploited the nonlocal
self-similarity (NSS) of images by imposing nonlocal low-rankness of similar
patches to achieve a superior performance. To fully utilize both the NSS in
Magnetic resonance (MR) images and calibration consistency in the k-space
domain, we propose a nonlocal low-rank (NLR)-SPIRiT model by incorporating NLR
regularization into the SPIRiT model. We apply the weighted nuclear norm (WNN)
as a surrogate of the rank and employ the Nash equilibrium (NE) formulation and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the
NLR-SPIRiT model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance
of NLR-SPIRiT over the state-of-the-art methods via three objective metrics and
visual comparison.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning models achieve strong performance for radiology image
classification, but their practical application is bottlenecked by the need for
large labeled training datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches
leverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer
potential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a
novel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic
graphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated
via a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby
eliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be
customized to handle a range of challenges in radiology image classification.
Specifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni
and multi-label classification, and class distribution mismatch between labeled
and unlabeled portions of the training data. In realistic empirical evaluations
on three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of
radiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the
fully supervised AUROC with less than 5-15% labeling budget. Further, NoTeacher
outperforms established SSL methods with minimal hyperparameter tuning, and has
implications as a principled and practical option for semisupervised learning
in radiology applications.</span>

                                        <span>Food logo detection plays an important role in the multimedia for its wide
real-world applications, such as food recommendation of the self-service shop
and infringement detection on e-commerce platforms. A large-scale food logo
dataset is urgently needed for developing advanced food logo detection
algorithms. However, there are no available food logo datasets with food brand
information. To support efforts towards food logo detection, we introduce the
dataset FoodLogoDet-1500, a new large-scale publicly available food logo
dataset, which has 1,500 categories, about 100,000 images and about 150,000
manually annotated food logo objects. We describe the collection and annotation
process of FoodLogoDet-1500, analyze its scale and diversity, and compare it
with other logo datasets. To the best of our knowledge, FoodLogoDet-1500 is the
first largest publicly available high-quality dataset for food logo detection.
The challenge of food logo detection lies in the large-scale categories and
similarities between food logo categories. For that, we propose a novel food
logo detection method Multi-scale Feature Decoupling Network (MFDNet), which
decouples classification and regression into two branches and focuses on the
classification branch to solve the problem of distinguishing multiple food logo
categories. Specifically, we introduce the feature offset module, which
utilizes the deformation-learning for optimal classification offset and can
effectively obtain the most representative features of classification in
detection. In addition, we adopt a balanced feature pyramid in MFDNet, which
pays attention to global information, balances the multi-scale feature maps,
and enhances feature extraction capability. Comprehensive experiments on
FoodLogoDet-1500 and other two benchmark logo datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The FoodLogoDet-1500 can be found at this

many individual traits. At the same time, such identification is vulnerable to
biometric copies. These presentation attacks pose a great challenge in
unsupervised authentication settings. As a countermeasure, we propose a method
that automatically analyzes the plausibility of facial behavior based on a
sequence of 3D face scans. A compact feature representation measures facial
behavior using the temporal curvature change. Finally, we train our method only
on genuine faces in an anomaly detection scenario. Our method can detect
presentation attacks using elastic 3D masks, bent photographs with eye holes,
and monitor replay-attacks. For evaluation, we recorded a challenging database
containing such cases using a high-quality 3D sensor. It features 109 4D face
scans including eleven different types of presentation attacks. We achieve
error rates of 11% and 6% for APCER and BPCER, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>The task of skeleton-based action recognition remains a core challenge in
human-centred scene understanding due to the multiple granularities and large
variation in human motion. Existing approaches typically employ a single neural
representation for different motion patterns, which has difficulty in capturing
fine-grained action classes given limited training data. To address the
aforementioned problems, we propose a novel multi-granular spatio-temporal
graph network for skeleton-based action classification that jointly models the
coarse- and fine-grained skeleton motion patterns. To this end, we develop a
dual-head graph network consisting of two interleaved branches, which enables
us to extract features at two spatio-temporal resolutions in an effective and
efficient manner. Moreover, our network utilises a cross-head communication
strategy to mutually enhance the representations of both heads. We conducted
extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU
RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-Skeleton, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance
on all the benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness of our method.</span>

high-quality research. We selected papers based on our inclusion criteria. In
this survey, we reviewed $98$ articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.
We have surveyed a complete pipeline of chest imaging analysis techniques
related to COVID-19, including data collection, pre-processing, feature
extraction, classification, and visualization. We have considered CT scans and
X-rays as both are widely used to describe the latest developments in medical

improving clinical diagnosis. In breast cancer screening, several recent
studies show that AI has the potential to improve radiologists&#x27; accuracy,
subsequently helping in early cancer diagnosis and reducing unnecessary workup.
As the number of proposed models and their complexity grows, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to re-implement them in order to reproduce the results
and to compare different approaches. To enable reproducibility of research in
this application area and to enable comparison between different methods, we
release a meta-repository containing deep learning models for classification of
screening mammograms. This meta-repository creates a framework that enables the
evaluation of machine learning models on any private or public screening
mammography data set. At its inception, our meta-repository contains five
state-of-the-art models with open-source implementations and cross-platform
compatibility. We compare their performance on five international data sets:
two private New York University breast cancer screening data sets as well as
three public (DDSM, INbreast and Chinese Mammography Database) data sets. Our
framework has a flexible design that can be generalized to other medical image
analysis tasks. The meta-repository is available at

                                        <span>Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often
requires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a
single expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the
inter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert
annotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of
interest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference
estimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural
network, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from
annotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.
U-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the
input images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image
masks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple
experts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the
applicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital
pathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate
models using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images
of human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of
lumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from
intravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based
on U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models
trained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of
multitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Natural numerical networks are introduced as a new classification algorithm
based on the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations of
forward-backward diffusion type on complete graphs. The proposed natural
numerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature
conservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using
satellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion
causes the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The
opposite effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward
diffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical
network contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of
the method. After learning parameters and optimizing the topology of the
network graph, classification necessary for habitat identification is
performed. A relevancy map for each habitat is introduced as a tool for
validating the classification and finding new Natura 2000 habitat appearances.</span>

in a variety of fields, including medical imaging. While most studies deploy
cross-entropy as the loss function in such tasks, a growing number of
approaches have turned to a family of contrastive learning-based losses. Even
though performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are
regularly used for the evaluation of CNN classifiers, the features that these
classifiers actually learn are rarely identified and their effect on the
classification performance on out-of-distribution test samples is
insufficiently explored. In this paper, motivated by the real-world task of
lung nodule classification, we investigate the features that a CNN learns when
trained and tested on different distributions of a synthetic dataset with
controlled modes of variation. We show that different loss functions lead to
different features being learned and consequently affect the generalization
ability of the classifier on unseen data. This study provides some important
insights into the design of deep learning solutions for medical imaging tasks.</span>

achieved comparable performance to supervised approaches, violations of the
static world assumption can still lead to erroneous depth predictions of
traffic participants, posing a potential safety issue. In this paper, we
present R4Dyn, a novel set of techniques to use cost-efficient radar data on
top of a self-supervised depth estimation framework. In particular, we show how
radar can be used during training as weak supervision signal, as well as an
extra input to enhance the estimation robustness at inference time. Since
automotive radars are readily available, this allows to collect training data
from a variety of existing vehicles. Moreover, by filtering and expanding the
signal to make it compatible with learning-based approaches, we address radar
inherent issues, such as noise and sparsity. With R4Dyn we are able to overcome
a major limitation of self-supervised depth estimation, i.e. the prediction of
traffic participants. We substantially improve the estimation on dynamic
objects, such as cars by 37% on the challenging nuScenes dataset, hence
demonstrating that radar is a valuable additional sensor for monocular depth
estimation in autonomous vehicles. Additionally, we plan on making the code
publicly available.</span>

advantages in long-distance human identification. Recently, sequence-based
methods have achieved high accuracy by learning abundant temporal and spatial
information. However, their robustness under adversarial attacks has not been
clearly explored. In this paper, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art gait
recognition model is vulnerable to such attacks. To this end, we propose a
novel temporal sparse adversarial attack method. Different from previous
additive noise models which add perturbations on original samples, we employ a
generative adversarial network based architecture to semantically generate
adversarial high-quality gait silhouettes or video frames. Moreover, by
sparsely substituting or inserting a few adversarial gait silhouettes, the
proposed method ensures its imperceptibility and achieves a high attack success
rate. The experimental results show that if only one-fortieth of the frames are
attacked, the accuracy of the target model drops dramatically.</span>

                                        <span>The vast majority of modern consumer-grade cameras employ a rolling shutter
mechanism, leading to image distortions if the camera moves during image
acquisition. In this paper, we present a novel deep network to solve the
generic rolling shutter correction problem with two consecutive frames. Our
pipeline is symmetrically designed to predict the global shutter image
corresponding to the intermediate time of these two frames, which is difficult
for existing methods because it corresponds to a camera pose that differs most
from the two frames. First, two time-symmetric dense undistortion flows are
estimated by using well-established principles: pyramidal construction,
warping, and cost volume processing. Then, both rolling shutter images are
warped into a common global shutter one in the feature space, respectively.
Finally, a symmetric consistency constraint is constructed in the image decoder
to effectively aggregate the contextual cues of two rolling shutter images,
thereby recovering the high-quality global shutter image. Extensive experiments
with both synthetic and real data from public benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>This paper aims to demonstrate the efficiency of the Adversarial Open Domain
Adaption framework for sketch-to-photo synthesis. The unsupervised open domain
adaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is
challenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The
absence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the
freehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that
learns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the
missing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between
synthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings
may produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking
classes. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain
sampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering
false drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo
and photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On
the Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most
current competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model
outperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and
retaining the structural layout.</span>

                                        <span>Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized
with lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer
interaction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to
generate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a
single face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous
text-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the
voice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing
speech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,
the proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and
talking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a
speech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a
face-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity
information from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a
personalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the
talking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that
can predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate
synchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and
non-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding
to the synthesized voice&#x27;s timbre and one&#x27;s appearance in the image, and the
proposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art
landmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.</span>

                                        <span>The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of
the olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The
lack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its
challenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition
techniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual
annotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for
solving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably
assess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and
fully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on
sub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we
designed a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both
OBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized
region through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning
architecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual
information, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline
exhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,
and volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the
Rhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent
dataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
with different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases
at the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.
We extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation
accuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively
replicate age effects.</span>

estimation and mapping using cues from an instance planar segmentation network.
While the mainstream approaches are using RGB-D sensors, employing a monocular
camera with such a system still faces challenges such as robust data
association and precise geometric model fitting. In the majority of existing
work, geometric model estimation problems such as homography estimation and
piece-wise planar reconstruction (PPR) are usually solved by standard (greedy)
RANSAC separately and sequentially. However, setting the inlier-outlier
threshold is difficult in absence of information about the scene (i.e. the
scale). In this work, we revisit these problems and argue that two mentioned
geometric models (homographies/3D planes) can be solved by minimizing an energy
function that exploits the spatial coherence, i.e. with graph-cut optimization,
which also tackles the practical issue when the output of a trained CNN is
inaccurate. Moreover, we propose an adaptive parameter setting strategy based
on our experiments, and report a comprehensive evaluation on various
open-source datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware
segmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on
fluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit
transformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class
membership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of
post-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is
error-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and
nuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to
segment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample
preparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that
operate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on
object detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we
propose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training
set. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale
and segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that
three out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34
backbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the
sample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation
performance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware
segmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,
consistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images
result in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and
sample preparation types.</span>

mature in the full reference (FR) case, while the burgeoning no reference (NR)
case remains challenging. We investigate variants of the popular VMAF video
quality assessment algorithm for the FR case, using support vector regression
and feedforward neural networks, and extend it to the NR case, using the same

heavily trained, algorithms such as VMAF perform well on test datasets, with
90%+ match; but predicting performance in the wild is better done by
training/testing from scratch, as we do. Even from scratch, we achieve 90%+
performance in FR, with gains over VMAF. And we greatly reduce complexity vs.
leading recent NR algorithms, VIDEVAL, RAPIQUE, yet exceed 80% in SRCC. In our
preliminary testing, we find the improvements in trainability, while also
constraining computational complexity, as quite encouraging, suggesting further
study and analysis.</span>

                                        <span>3D reconstruction of large scenes is a challenging problem due to the
high-complexity nature of the solution space, in particular for generative
neural networks. In contrast to traditional generative learned models which
encode the full generative process into a neural network and can struggle with
maintaining local details at the scene level, we introduce a new method that
directly leverages scene geometry from the training database. First, we learn
to synthesize an initial estimate for a 3D scene, constructed by retrieving a
top-k set of volumetric chunks from the scene database. These candidates are
then refined to a final scene generation with an attention-based refinement
that can effectively select the most consistent set of geometry from the
candidates and combine them together to create an output scene, facilitating
transfer of coherent structures and local detail from train scene geometry. We
demonstrate our neural scene reconstruction with a database for the tasks of 3D
super resolution and surface reconstruction from sparse point clouds, showing
that our approach enables generation of more coherent, accurate 3D scenes,
improving on average by over 8% in IoU over state-of-the-art scene
reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>Weighted Hamming distance, as a similarity measure between binary codes and
binary queries, provides superior accuracy in search tasks than Hamming
distance. However, how to efficiently and accurately find $K$ binary codes that
have the smallest weighted Hamming distance to the query remains an open issue.
In this paper, a fast search algorithm is proposed to perform the
non-exhaustive search for $K$ nearest binary codes by weighted Hamming
distance. By using binary codes as direct bucket indices in a hash table, the
search algorithm generates a sequence to probe the buckets based on the
independence characteristic of the weights for each bit. Furthermore, a fast
search framework based on the proposed search algorithm is designed to solve
the problem of long binary codes. Specifically, long binary codes are split
into substrings and multiple hash tables are built on them. Then, the search
algorithm probes the buckets to obtain candidates according to the generated
substring indices, and a merging algorithm is proposed to find the nearest
binary codes by merging the candidates. Theoretical analysis and experimental
results demonstrate that the search algorithm improves the search accuracy
compared to other non-exhaustive algorithms and provides orders-of-magnitude
faster search than the linear scan baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks
effectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion
distribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive
proposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a
specific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from
releasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic
non-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to
remove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,
we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental
model to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion
distribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is
used to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning
characteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the
first reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work
in both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that
MCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted
feature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG
domains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of
the art by a clear margin under different scenarios.</span>

translation, but sometimes the translated results are in poor quality and the
contents are not preserved consistently. In this paper, we uncover that the
negative examples play a critical role in the performance of contrastive
learning for image translation. The negative examples in previous methods are
randomly sampled from the patches of different positions in the source image,
which are not effective to push the positive examples close to the query

Generation for Contrastive learning in Unpaired image-to-image

examples online. The generator is novel from two perspectives: 1) it is
instance-wise which means that the generated examples are based on the input
image, and 2) it can generate hard negative examples since it is trained with
an adversarial loss. With the generator, the performance of unpaired
image-to-image translation is significantly improved. Experiments on three

complexity and variety of scene texts. In this work, we propose a novel
adaptive boundary proposal network for arbitrary shape text detection, which
can learn to directly produce accurate boundary for arbitrary shape text
without any post-processing. Our method mainly consists of a boundary proposal
model and an innovative adaptive boundary deformation model. The boundary
proposal model constructed by multi-layer dilated convolutions is adopted to
produce prior information (including classification map, distance field, and
direction field) and coarse boundary proposals. The adaptive boundary
deformation model is an encoder-decoder network, in which the encoder mainly
consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN). It aims to perform boundary deformation in an iterative way for
obtaining text instance shape guided by prior information from the boundary
proposal model. In this way, our method can directly and efficiently generate
accurate text boundaries without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments

                                        <span>Finding tampered regions in images is a hot research topic in machine
learning and computer vision. Although many image manipulation location
algorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with
different color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the
potential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end
two-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for
generic image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency
stream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.
Specifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to
adaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and
eliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive
cross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB
feature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location
network (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the
parameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are
further fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the
frequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly
optimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The
results of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the
image manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and
In-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of
both MCC and F1.</span>

In this paper, we take a different approach. Our architecture, named PE-Net,
learns the representation of point clouds in high-dimensional space, and

can be applied to. The recommended network can adapt to changes in the number

multimodal fusion framework FusionPainting to fuse the 2D RGB image and 3D
point clouds at a semantic level for boosting the 3D object detection task.
Especially, the FusionPainting framework consists of three main modules: a
multi-modal semantic segmentation module, an adaptive attention-based semantic
fusion module, and a 3D object detector. First, semantic information is
obtained for 2D images and 3D Lidar point clouds based on 2D and 3D
segmentation approaches. Then the segmentation results from different sensors
are adaptively fused based on the proposed attention-based semantic fusion
module. Finally, the point clouds painted with the fused semantic label are
sent to the 3D detector for obtaining the 3D objection results. The
effectiveness of the proposed framework has been verified on the large-scale
nuScenes detection benchmark by comparing it with three different baselines.
The experimental results show that the fusion strategy can significantly
improve the detection performance compared to the methods using only point
clouds, and the methods using point clouds only painted with 2D segmentation
information. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes testing benchmark.</span>

successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification,
image segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and
interpretability, not only do we need the predictions made by the model but
also how confident it is while making those predictions. This is important in
safety critical applications for the people to accept it. In this work, we used
an encoder decoder architecture based on variational inference techniques for
segmenting brain tumour images. We evaluate our work on the publicly available
BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over
Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model is able to segment brain
tumours while taking into account both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic
uncertainty in a principled bayesian manner.</span>

                                        <span>Recent vision-language (VL) studies have shown remarkable progress by
learning generic representations from massive image-text pairs with transformer
models and then fine-tuning on downstream VL tasks. While existing research has
been focused on achieving high accuracy with large pre-trained models, building
a lightweight model is of great value in practice but is less explored. In this
paper, we propose a smaller and faster VL model, MiniVLM, which can be
finetuned with good performance on various downstream tasks like its larger
counterpart. MiniVLM consists of two modules, a vision feature extractor and a
transformer-based vision-language fusion module. We design a Two-stage
Efficient feature Extractor (TEE), inspired by the one-stage EfficientDet
network, to significantly reduce the time cost of visual feature extraction by
$95\%$, compared to a baseline model. We adopt the MiniLM structure to reduce
the computation cost of the transformer module after comparing different
compact BERT models. In addition, we improve the MiniVLM pre-training by adding
$7M$ Open Images data, which are pseudo-labeled by a state-of-the-art
captioning model. We also pre-train with high-quality image tags obtained from
a strong tagging model to enhance cross-modality alignment. The large models
are used offline without adding any overhead in fine-tuning and inference. With
the above design choices, our MiniVLM reduces the model size by $73\%$ and the
inference time cost by $94\%$ while being able to retain $94-97\%$ of the
accuracy on multiple VL tasks. We hope that MiniVLM helps ease the use of the
state-of-the-art VL research for on-the-edge applications.</span>

                                        <span>We present &quot;Cross-Camera Convolutional Color Constancy&quot; (C5), a
learning-based method, trained on images from multiple cameras, that accurately
estimates a scene&#x27;s illuminant color from raw images captured by a new camera
previously unseen during training. C5 is a hypernetwork-like extension of the
convolutional color constancy (CCC) approach: C5 learns to generate the weights
of a CCC model that is then evaluated on the input image, with the CCC weights
dynamically adapted to different input content. Unlike prior cross-camera color
constancy models, which are usually designed to be agnostic to the spectral
properties of test-set images from unobserved cameras, C5 approaches this
problem through the lens of transductive inference: additional unlabeled images
are provided as input to the model at test time, which allows the model to
calibrate itself to the spectral properties of the test-set camera during
inference. C5 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for cross-camera color
constancy on several datasets, is fast to evaluate (~7 and ~90 ms per image on
a GPU or CPU, respectively), and requires little memory (~2 MB), and, thus, is
a practical solution to the problem of calibration-free automatic white balance
for mobile photography.</span>

                                        <span>Key for solving fine-grained image categorization is finding discriminate and
local regions that correspond to subtle visual traits. Great strides have been
made, with complex networks designed specifically to learn part-level
discriminate feature representations. In this paper, we show it is possible to
cultivate subtle details without the need for overly complicated network
designs or training mechanisms -- a single loss is all it takes. The main trick
lies with how we delve into individual feature channels early on, as opposed to
the convention of starting from a consolidated feature map. The proposed loss
function, termed as mutual-channel loss (MC-Loss), consists of two
channel-specific components: a discriminality component and a diversity
component. The discriminality component forces all feature channels belonging
to the same class to be discriminative, through a novel channel-wise attention
mechanism. The diversity component additionally constraints channels so that
they become mutually exclusive on spatial-wise. The end result is therefore a
set of feature channels that each reflects different locally discriminative
regions for a specific class. The MC-Loss can be trained end-to-end, without
the need for any bounding-box/part annotations, and yields highly
discriminative regions during inference. Experimental results show our MC-Loss
when implemented on top of common base networks can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on all four fine-grained categorization datasets (CUB-Birds,
FGVC-Aircraft, Flowers-102, and Stanford-Cars). Ablative studies further
demonstrate the superiority of MC-Loss when compared with other recently
proposed general-purpose losses for visual classification, on two different
base networks. Code available at

                                        <span>Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional
improvements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to
provide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.
The diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important
characteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this
characteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely
been investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,
abundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an
essential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps
derived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a
set of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different
classes. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a
sufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to
them as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the
optimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes
addressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard
cross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of
unique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set
of valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor
learning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to
show the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose
architectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last
layers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than
MobileNetV3 Large.</span>

attracted increasing number of attentions. The neglect of considering the pixel
sensitivity within the cover image of deep neural methods will inevitably
affect the model robustness for information hiding. Targeting at the problem,
in this paper, we propose a novel deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient
Attention (IGA), combing the ideas of adversarial learning and attention
mechanism to endow different sensitivity to different pixels. With the proposed
component, the model can spotlight pixels with more robustness for embedding
data. Empirically, extensive experiments show that the proposed model
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two prevalent datasets under
multiple settings. Besides, we further identify and discuss the connections
between the proposed inverse gradient attention and high-frequency regions
within images.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic segmentation is a crucial step in many Earth observation tasks.
Large quantity of pixel-level annotation is required to train deep networks for
semantic segmentation. Earth observation techniques are applied to varieties of
applications and since classes vary widely depending on the applications,
therefore, domain knowledge is often required to label Earth observation
images, impeding availability of labeled training data in many Earth
observation applications. To tackle these challenges, in this paper we propose
an unsupervised semantic segmentation method that can be trained using just a
single unlabeled scene. Remote sensing scenes are generally large. The proposed
method exploits this property to sample smaller patches from the larger scene
and uses deep clustering and contrastive learning to refine the weights of a
lightweight deep model composed of a series of the convolution layers along
with an embedded channel attention. After unsupervised training on the target
image/scene, the model automatically segregates the major classes present in
the scene and produces the segmentation map. Experimental results on the
Vaihingen dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA)
method via feature level pseudo-reference (PR) hallucination. The proposed
quality assessment framework is grounded on the prior models of natural image
statistical behaviors and rooted in the view that the perceptually meaningful
features could be well exploited to characterize the visual quality. Herein,
the PR features from the distorted images are learned by a mutual learning
scheme with the pristine reference as the supervision, and the discriminative
characteristics of PR features are further ensured with the triplet
constraints. Given a distorted image for quality inference, the feature level
disentanglement is performed with an invertible neural layer for final quality
prediction, leading to the PR and the corresponding distortion features for
comparison. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated on four
popular IQA databases, and superior performance on cross-database evaluation
also reveals the high generalization capability of our method. The
implementation of our method is publicly available on

performances in various computer vision tasks. Advances on CNN architectures
have focused mainly on designing convolutional blocks of the feature
extractors, but less on the classifiers that exploit extracted features. In
this work, we propose Split-and-Share Module (SSM),a classifier that splits a
given feature into parts, which are partially shared by multiple
sub-classifiers. Our intuition is that the more the features are shared, the
more common they will become, and SSM can encourage such structural
characteristics in the split features. SSM can be easily integrated into any
architecture without bells and whistles. We have extensively validated the
efficacy of SSM on ImageNet-1K classification task, andSSM has shown consistent
and significant improvements over baseline architectures. In addition, we
analyze the effect of SSM using the Grad-CAM visualization.</span>

camera parameters, pose and viewpoint variations. These variations make person
Re-Identification (ReID) a challenging problem. Nevertheless, human attributes
usually stand as robust visual properties to such variations. In this paper, we
propose a new method to leverage features from human attributes for person
ReID. Our model uses a tensor to non-linearly fuse identity and attribute
features, and then forces the parameters of the tensor in the loss function to
generate discriminative fused features for ReID. Since tensor-based methods
usually contain a large number of parameters, training all of these parameters
becomes very slow, and the chance of overfitting increases as well. To address
this issue, we propose two new techniques based on Structural Sparsity Learning
(SSL) and Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods to create an accurate and stable
learning problem. We conducted experiments on several standard pedestrian
datasets, and experimental results indicate that our tensor-based approach
significantly improves person ReID baselines and also outperforms state of the
art methods.</span>

we present AutoVideo, a Python system for automated video action recognition.
It currently supports seven action recognition algorithms and various
pre-processing modules. Unlike the existing libraries that only provide model
zoos, AutoVideo is built with the standard pipeline language. The basic
building block is primitive, which wraps a pre-processing module or an
algorithm with some hyperparameters. AutoVideo is highly modular and
extendable. It can be easily combined with AutoML searchers. The pipeline
language is quite general so that we can easily enrich AutoVideo with
algorithms for various other video-related tasks in the future. AutoVideo is

training examples, and a (large) set of unlabeled training examples.
State-of-the-art models can reach within a few percentage points of
fully-supervised training, while requiring 100x less labeled data.

We study a new class of vulnerabilities: poisoning attacks that modify the
unlabeled dataset. In order to be useful, unlabeled datasets are given strictly
less review than labeled datasets, and adversaries can therefore poison them
easily. By inserting maliciously-crafted unlabeled examples totaling just 0.1%
of the dataset size, we can manipulate a model trained on this poisoned dataset
to misclassify arbitrary examples at test time (as any desired label). Our
attacks are highly effective across datasets and semi-supervised learning
methods.

We find that more accurate methods (thus more likely to be used) are
significantly more vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and as such better training
methods are unlikely to prevent this attack. To counter this we explore the
space of defenses, and propose two methods that mitigate our attack.</span>

solutions for interactive tasks in large-scale realistic scenes. Our
environment contains 15 fully interactive home-sized scenes with 108 rooms
populated with rigid and articulated objects. The scenes are replicas of
real-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those
of the real world. iGibson 1.0 integrates several key features to facilitate
the study of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor
signals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain
randomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)
and/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate
collision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive
human-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human
demonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the
scenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate
the training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson 1.0
features enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the
human-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient
imitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.
iGibson 1.0 is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and
documentation. For more information, visit our project website:

                                        <span>The great success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for facial attribute
prediction relies on a large amount of labeled images. Facial image datasets
are usually annotated by some commonly used attributes (e.g., gender), while
labels for the other attributes (e.g., big nose) are limited which causes their
prediction challenging. To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task
Learning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the
knowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization
performance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it
is assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial
attributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,
predictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a
limited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the
coefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task
is represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed
that the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters
of the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.
Our MTL methods are compared with competing methods for facial attribute
prediction to show its effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Anatomical structures such as the hippocampus, liver, and bones can be
analyzed as orientable, closed surfaces. This permits the computation of
volume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the
Euler-Poincar\&#x27;e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics
between structures of different topology. The structures are commonly
represented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an
embedding. Practically, binary images of anatomical structures are embedded
using a signed distance transform. However, quantization prevents the accurate
computation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This
paper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local
morphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The
proposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of
50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed
distance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local
curvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman
analysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean
curvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%
with the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is
improved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed
method. The Euler-Poincar\&#x27;e characteristic is improved from unusable in the
signed distance transform to 98% accuracy for the proposed method. The proposed
method enables an improved local and global evaluation of curvature for
purposes of morphometry on closed, implicit surfaces.</span>

                                        <span>Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate
in the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based
on some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,
these single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for
tasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To
this end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that
accurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object
detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth
estimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at
different semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or
conflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can
provide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate
the task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based
on the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the
neural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using
untargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact
amongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we
show that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric
and their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level
representations.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called
outside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent
interest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly
large fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal
information. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on
speculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.
To add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective
because of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test
folds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit
these weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque
and their &#x27;reasoning&#x27; process is uninterpretable. An equally important
limitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only
of the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the
correct(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a
key structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and
build a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner
identifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity
which can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage
mentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA
annotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from
scratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,
S3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent
competitive baselines.</span>

                                        <span>In real applications, different computation-resource devices need
different-depth networks (e.g., ResNet-18/34/50) with high-accuracy. Usually,
existing methods either design multiple networks and train them independently,
or construct depth-level/width-level dynamic neural networks which is hard to
prove the accuracy of each sub-net. In this article, we propose an elegant
Depth-Level Dynamic Neural Network (DDNN) integrated different-depth sub-nets
of similar architectures. To improve the generalization of sub-nets, we design
the Embedded-Knowledge-Distillation (EKD) training mechanism for the DDNN to
implement knowledge transfer from the teacher (full-net) to multiple students
(sub-nets). Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to
constrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and
sub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of
different depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of
sub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in
a DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without
extra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet
datasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better
performance than individually training networks while preserving the original
performance of full-nets.</span>

building models which understand user interfaces (UIs) and assist users to
complete their tasks is critical. However, unique challenges are proposed by
UI-specific characteristics, such as how to effectively leverage multimodal UI
features that involve image, text, and structural metadata and how to achieve
good performance when high-quality labeled data is unavailable. To address such
challenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model
trained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to
learn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key
intuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e.,
the image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We
propose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different
features of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We
evaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert
outperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be conveniently used
to classify suspicious breast nodules and potentially detect the onset of
breast cancer. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have
shown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into
benign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as
such, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort
has been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM
and other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of
CNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important
information, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this
work, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may
be devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will
show that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering
the classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care
must be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner
workings of deep learning. Finally, we utilize Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and
propose a new network based on ResNet-50 to improve the classification
accuracies. Our sensitivity and specificity is comparable to the state of the
art results.</span>

support and forecast. However, there is no such kind of data during night time.
To overcome this, we propose a method based on deep learning to create
synthetic satellite visible light images during night. Specifically, to produce
more realistic products, we train a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model
to generate visible light images given the corresponding satellite infrared
images and numerical weather prediction(NWP) products. To better model the
nonlinear relationship from infrared data and NWP products to visible light
images, we propose to use the channel-wise attention mechanics, e.g., SEBlock
to quantitative weight the input channels. The experiments based on the ECMWF
NWP products and FY-4A meteorology satellite visible light and infrared
channels date show that the proposed methods can be effective to create
realistic synthetic satellite visible light images during night.</span>

with a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any

in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. Multiple
evolutionary strategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that
employs a neural network in order to direct the search in the direction of
promising samples, without adding fitness evaluations. The results we present

Although current literature on the transfer-based adversarial attack has
achieved promising results for improving the transferability to unseen
black-box models, it still leaves a long way to go. Inspired by the idea of
meta-learning, this paper proposes a novel architecture called Meta Gradient
Adversarial Attack (MGAA), which is plug-and-play and can be integrated with
any existing gradient-based attack method for improving the cross-model
transferability. Specifically, we randomly sample multiple models from a model
zoo to compose different tasks and iteratively simulate a white-box attack and
a black-box attack in each task. By narrowing the gap between the gradient
directions in white-box and black-box attacks, the transferability of
adversarial examples on the black-box setting can be improved. Extensive
experiments on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets show that our architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for both black-box and white-box
attack settings.</span>

&quot;inverting&quot; a Neural RadianceField (NeRF). NeRFs have been shown to be
remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis - synthesizing
photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we
investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free,
RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation and
rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that
no object mesh models are available during either training or test time.
Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the
residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image.
In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement
for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of
rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex
real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating
the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training
data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform category-level object pose
estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB
images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.</span>

of yet there is no consensus on best practices for compounding. Ultrasound
images depend on probe direction and the path sound waves pass through, so when
multiple intersecting B-scans of the same spot from different perspectives
yield different pixel values, there is not a single, ideal representation for
compounding (i.e. combining) the overlapping pixel values. Current popular
methods inevitably suppress or altogether leave out bright or dark regions that
are useful, and potentially introduce new artifacts. In this work, we establish
a new algorithm to compound the overlapping pixels from different view points
in ultrasound. We uniquely leverage Laplacian and Gaussian Pyramids to preserve
the maximum boundary contrast without overemphasizing noise and speckle. We
evaluate our algorithm by comparing ours with previous algorithms, and we show
that our approach not only preserves both light and dark details, but also
somewhat suppresses artifacts, rather than amplifying them.</span>

engaging stories remains challenging and requires non-trivial video editing
expertise. Many video editing components are astonishingly hard to automate
primarily due to the lack of raw video materials. This paper focuses on a new
task for computational video editing, namely the task of raking cut
plausibility. Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited
to learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we
first collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract
more than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real
and artificial cuts via contrastive learning. We set up a new task and a set of
baselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model
outperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in
real-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited
videos. The results show that our model does a better job at cutting than
random and alternative baselines.</span>

to train, validate, and test models. With increased technical capabilities,
machine learning research has boomed in both academic and industry settings,
and one major focus has been on computer vision. Computer vision is a popular
domain of machine learning increasingly pertinent to real-world applications,
from facial recognition in policing to object detection for autonomous
vehicles. Given computer vision&#x27;s propensity to shape machine learning research
and impact human life, we seek to understand disciplinary practices around
dataset documentation - how data is collected, curated, annotated, and packaged
into datasets for computer vision researchers and practitioners to use for
model tuning and development. Specifically, we examine what dataset
documentation communicates about the underlying values of vision data and the
larger practices and goals of computer vision as a field. To conduct this
study, we collected a corpus of about 500 computer vision datasets, from which
we sampled 114 dataset publications across different vision tasks. Through both
a structured and thematic content analysis, we document a number of values
around accepted data practices, what makes desirable data, and the treatment of
humans in the dataset construction process. We discuss how computer vision
datasets authors value efficiency at the expense of care; universality at the
expense of contextuality; impartiality at the expense of positionality; and
model work at the expense of data work. Many of the silenced values we identify
sit in opposition with social computing practices. We conclude with suggestions
on how to better incorporate silenced values into the dataset creation and
curation process.</span>

it is crucial to design effective and human-friendly techniques when opening

provides a human-friendly explanation, and its corresponding explanation
algorithm refers to a strategic alternation of a given data point so that its
model output is &quot;counter-facted&quot;, i.e. the prediction is reverted. In this
paper, we adapt counterfactual explanation over fine-grained image
classification problem. We demonstrated an adaptive method that could give a
counterfactual explanation by showing the composed counterfactual feature map

people&#x27;s lives and property, which is often accompanied with surface cracks. If
such surface cracks could be identified in time, it is of great significance
for the monitoring and early warning of geohazards. Currently, the most common
method for crack identification is manual detection, which is with low
efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, a deep transfer learning framework is
proposed to effectively and efficiently identify slope surface cracks for the
sake of fast monitoring and early warning of geohazards such as landslides. The
essential idea is to employ transfer learning by training (a) the large sample
dataset of concrete cracks and (b) the small sample dataset of soil and rock
masses cracks. In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification
models are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks;
(2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the
small sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks. The proposed framework
could be applied to conduct UAV surveys on high-steep slopes to realize the
monitoring and early warning of landslides to ensure the safety of people&#x27;s
lives and property.</span>

of Neural Cellular Automata shows promising results in a variety of tasks. So
far, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As
each scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory
to the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we
introduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a
single Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we
introduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with
Generative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through
adversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of
learning several images when presented with different inputs, and that the
adversarially trained model improves drastically on out-of-distribution data
compared to a supervised trained model.</span>

                                        <span>Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in
real-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory
patterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully
modelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative
distances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is
because they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different
types of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby
pedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,
we propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural
network to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class
labels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which
is combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the
objects&#x27; velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).
SAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to
automatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the
fixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal
dependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional
network to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose
new metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final
Displacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We
call our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance
to the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine
learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been
proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the
same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance
must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person
has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they
also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing
person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail.
To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task,
but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for
representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be
improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve
these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding
algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual
semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and
the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively
solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a
person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme
(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth
desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of
the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level
human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of
pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially
semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic
information that is used to align the human attributes.</span>

                                        <span>The defect detection task can be regarded as a realistic scenario of object
detection in the computer vision field and it is widely used in the industrial
field. Directly applying vanilla object detector to defect detection task can
achieve promising results, while there still exists challenging issues that
have not been solved. The first issue is the texture shift which means a
trained defect detector model will be easily affected by unseen texture, and
the second issue is partial visual confusion which indicates that a partial
defect box is visually similar with a complete box. To tackle these two
problems, we propose a Reference-based Defect Detection Network (RDDN).
Specifically, we introduce template reference and context reference to against
those two problems, respectively. Template reference can reduce the texture
shift from image, feature or region levels, and encourage the detectors to
focus more on the defective area as a result. We can use either well-aligned
template images or the outputs of a pseudo template generator as template
references in this work, and they are jointly trained with detectors by the
supervision of normal samples. To solve the partial visual confusion issue, we
propose to leverage the carried context information of context reference, which
is the concentric bigger box of each region proposal, to perform more accurate
region classification and regression. Experiments on two defect detection
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

                                        <span>The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated
with image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,
rather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),
task amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific
image quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using
reinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,
such as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we
develop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability
of both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on
high-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning
strategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm
facilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image
quality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including
different images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates
that the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to
predict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small
set of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate
cancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks
show that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as
respective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve
comparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training
dataset with 100% expert labels.</span>

                                        <span>We present a new method to create spatial data using a generative adversarial
network (GAN). Our contribution uses coarse and widely available geospatial
data to create maps of less available features at the finer scale in the built
environment, bypassing their traditional acquisition techniques (e.g. satellite
imagery or land surveying). In the work, we employ land use data and road
networks as input to generate building footprints, and conduct experiments in 9
cities around the world. The method, which we implement in a tool we release
openly, enables generating approximate maps of the urban form, and it is
generalisable to augment other types of geoinformation, enhancing the
completeness and quality of spatial data infrastructure. It may be especially
useful in locations missing detailed and high-resolution data and those that
are mapped with uncertain or heterogeneous quality, such as much of

scale. In most cases, experiments suggest promising performance as the method
tends to truthfully indicate the locations, amount, and shape of buildings. The
work has the potential to support several applications, such as energy,

                                        <span>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that is leading to the death of
millions of people across the world. The mortality rate of this disease is high
in patients suffering from immuno-compromised disorders. The early diagnosis of
this disease can save lives and can avoid further complications. But the
diagnosis of TB is a very complex task. The standard diagnostic tests still
rely on traditional procedures developed in the last century. These procedures
are slow and expensive. So this paper presents an automatic approach for the
diagnosis of TB from posteroanterior chest x-rays. This is a two-step approach,
where in the first step the lung regions are segmented from the chest x-rays
using the graph cut method, and then in the second step the transfer learning
of VGG16 combined with Bi-directional LSTM is used for extracting high-level
discriminative features from the segmented lung regions and then classification
is performed using a fully connected layer. The proposed model is evaluated
using data from two publicly available databases namely Montgomery Country set
and Schezien set. The proposed model achieved accuracy and sensitivity of
97.76%, 97.01% and 96.42%, 94.11% on Schezien and Montgomery county datasets.
This model enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of TB by 0.7% and 11.68% on
Schezien and Montgomery county datasets.</span>

reference images. Existing universal style transfer methods successfully
deliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a
photo-realistic way. However, the range of &#x27;arbitrary style&#x27; defined by
existing works is bounded in the particular domain due to their structural
limitation. Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization
are established according to a predefined target domain. As a result, both
photo-realistic and artistic models have difficulty in performing the desired
style transfer for the other domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
unified architecture, Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN) that transfer
not only the style but also the property of domain (i.e., domainness) from a
given reference image. To this end, we design a novel domainness indicator that
captures the domainness value from the texture and structural features of
reference images. Moreover, we introduce a unified framework with domain-aware
skip connection to adaptively transfer the stroke and palette to the input
contents guided by the domainness indicator. Our extensive experiments validate
that our model produces better qualitative results and outperforms previous

direct synthesis of 3D shapes in the form of point clouds. Compared with
existing models, SP-GAN is able to synthesize diverse and high-quality shapes
with fine details and promote controllability for part-aware shape generation
and manipulation, yet trainable without any parts annotations. In SP-GAN, we
incorporate a global prior (uniform points on a sphere) to spatially guide the
generative process and attach a local prior (a random latent code) to each
sphere point to provide local details. The key insight in our design is to
disentangle the complex 3D shape generation task into a global shape modeling
and a local structure adjustment, to ease the learning process and enhance the
shape generation quality. Also, our model forms an implicit dense
correspondence between the sphere points and points in every generated shape,
enabling various forms of structure-aware shape manipulations such as part
editing, part-wise shape interpolation, and multi-shape part composition, etc.,
beyond the existing generative models. Experimental results, which include both

                                        <span>For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer
vision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic
computational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.
There has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in
this context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and
hit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only
inductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is
still a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the
architecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.
A way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another
way is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.
With this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while
reducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other
MLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of
computational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In
addition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to
replace CNNs by adopting inductive bias. The source code in PyTorch version is

visual patterns. The same is true of deep neural networks, which currently
constitute the best performing artificial vision systems. Our goal is to
examine the congruence, or lack thereof, in the information-gathering
strategies of the two systems. We have operationalized our investigation as a
character recognition task. We have used eye-tracking to assay the spatial
distribution of information hotspots for humans via fixation maps and an
activation mapping technique for obtaining analogous distributions for deep
networks through visualization maps. Qualitative comparison between
visualization maps and fixation maps reveals an interesting correlate of
congruence. The deep learning model considered similar regions in character,
which humans have fixated in the case of correctly classified characters. On
the other hand, when the focused regions are different for humans and deep
nets, the characters are typically misclassified by the latter. Hence, we
propose to use the visual fixation maps obtained from the eye-tracking
experiment as a supervisory input to align the model&#x27;s focus on relevant
character regions. We find that such supervision improves the model&#x27;s
performance significantly and does not require any additional parameters. This
approach has the potential to find applications in diverse domains such as
medical analysis and surveillance in which explainability helps to determine
system fidelity.</span>

without explicitly indicating the corrupted regions in a face image.
Inherently, this task faces two challenges: (1) how to detect various mask
patterns of different shapes and contents; (2) how to restore visually
plausible and pleasing contents in the masked regions. In this paper, we
propose a novel two-stage blind face inpainting method named Frequency-guided
Transformer and Top-Down Refinement Network (FT-TDR) to tackle these
challenges. Specifically, we first use a transformer-based network to detect
the corrupted regions to be inpainted as masks by modeling the relation among
different patches. We also exploit the frequency modality as complementary
information for improved detection results and capture the local contextual
incoherence to enhance boundary consistency. Then a top-down refinement network
is proposed to hierarchically restore features at different levels and generate
contents that are semantically consistent with the unmasked face regions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current
state-of-the-art blind and non-blind face inpainting methods qualitatively and
quantitatively.</span>

                                        <span>Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,
accomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters
in a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the
search phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be
selected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the
values of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much
has been discussed about the supernet&#x27;s optimization, the architecture
selection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and
theoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does
not necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet&#x27;s
performance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture
selection that directly measures each operation&#x27;s influence on the supernet. We
re-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture
selection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved
architectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find
that several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed
selection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in
DARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture
selection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.</span>

                                        <span>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in Bangladesh, and as
a result, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is widespread in the population. DR, an eye
illness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and
treated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically
trained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to
its population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting
many from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we
introduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.
We use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on
retinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the
algorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for
Bangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of
retinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in
Bangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening
Bangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,
and can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall
accuracy of 92.27\% and 93.02\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The
results confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical
settings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics. Our
algorithm is implemented in the application Drishti, which is used to screen
for DR in patients living in rural areas in Bangladesh, where access to
professional screening is limited.</span>

important processes in the production pipeline of hand-drawn inbetweening
frames. This process requires time-consuming manual work imposing a tremendous
burden on the animators. We propose a method to estimate stroke correspondences
between raster character images (keyframes) without vectorization processes.
First, the proposed system separates the closed areas in each keyframe and
estimates the correspondences between closed areas by using the characteristics
of shape, depth, and closed area connection. Second, the proposed system
estimates stroke correspondences from the estimated closed area
correspondences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing a

The framework is designed to mitigate the issues of collecting and annotating
social media data by cohesively combining machine and human in the data
collection process. From a given list of the articles from professional news
media or blog, AMUSED detects links to the social media posts from news
articles and then downloads contents of the same post from the respective
social media platform to gather details about that specific post. The framework
is capable of fetching the annotated data from multiple platforms like Twitter,
YouTube, Reddit. The framework aims to reduce the workload and problems behind
the data annotation from the social media platforms. AMUSED can be applied in
multiple application domains, as a use case, we have implemented the framework
for collecting COVID-19 misinformation data from different social media
platforms.</span>

                                        <span>Recommendation for new users, also called user cold start, has been a
well-recognized challenge for online recommender systems. Most existing methods
view the crux as the lack of initial data. However, in this paper, we argue
that there are neglected problems: 1) New users&#x27; behaviour follows much
different distributions from regular users. 2) Although personalized features
are involved, heavily imbalanced samples prevent the model from balancing
new/regular user distributions, as if the personalized features are
overwhelmed. We name the problem as the &#x60;&#x60;submergence&quot; of personalization. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules
(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes
existing modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.
Then, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive
representations. In such way, POSO projects imbalanced features to even
modules. POSO can be flexibly integrated into many existing modules and
effectively improves their performance with negligible computational overheads.
The proposed method shows remarkable advantage in industrial scenario. It has
been deployed on the large-scale recommender system of Kwai, and improves new
user Watch Time by a large margin (+7.75%). Moreover, POSO can be further
generalized to regular users, inactive users and returning users (+2%-3% on
Watch Time), as well as item cold start (+3.8% on Watch Time). Its
effectiveness has also been verified on public dataset (MovieLens 20M). We
believe such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.</span>

search queries which are real, accurate, diverse, relevant and engaging.
Obtaining large amounts of query-quality human annotations is expensive. Prior
work on supervised query suggestion models suffered from selection and exposure
bias, and relied on sparse and noisy immediate user-feedback (e.g., clicks),
leading to low quality suggestions. Reinforcement Learning techniques employed
to reformulate a query using terms from search results, have limited
scalability to large-scale industry applications. To recommend high quality
related search queries, we train a Deep Reinforcement Learning model to predict
the query a user would enter next. The reward signal is composed of long-term
session-based user feedback, syntactic relatedness and estimated naturalness of
generated query. Over the baseline supervised model, our proposed approach

                                        <span>Recently, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods have achieved
outstanding performance for recommendation. These methods embed users and items
in Euclidean space, and perform graph convolution on user-item interaction
graphs. However, real-world datasets usually exhibit tree-like hierarchical
structures, which make Euclidean space less effective in capturing user-item
relationship. In contrast, hyperbolic space, as a continuous analogue of a
tree-graph, provides a promising alternative. In this paper, we propose a fully
hyperbolic GCN model for recommendation, where all operations are performed in
hyperbolic space. Utilizing the advantage of hyperbolic space, our method is
able to embed users/items with less distortion and capture user-item
interaction relationship more accurately. Extensive experiments on public
benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms both Euclidean and
hyperbolic counterparts and requires far lower embedding dimensionality to
achieve comparable performance.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm
for recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,
standard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to
capture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either
ignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can
simultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,
i.e. that a user&#x27;s preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic
characteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this
paper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent
user-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired
by translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages
memory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this
joint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on
recommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also
emphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender
systems (RS). It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item
pair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be
improved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,
especially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce
website shows that 23\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5
months. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user
behaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the
strict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are
proposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an
auxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term
user behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism
is conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first
stage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main
CTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of
long-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target
Attention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make
the end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible. Both
offline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model. We
deploy ETA into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra
3.1\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to a two-stage
long user sequence CTR model.</span>

                                        <span>User-item interactions in recommendations can be naturally de-noted as a
user-item bipartite graph. Given the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in
graph representation learning, GNN-based C methods have been proposed to
advance recommender systems. These methods often make recommendations based on
the learned user and item embeddings. However, we found that they do not
perform well wit sparse user-item graphs which are quite common in real-world
recommendations. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel perspective to
build GNN-based CF methods for recommendations which leads to the proposed
framework Localized Graph Collaborative Filtering (LGCF). One key advantage of
LGCF is that it does not need to learn embeddings for each user and item, which
is challenging in sparse scenarios.

Alternatively, LGCF aims at encoding useful CF information into a localized
graph and making recommendations based on such graph. Extensive experiments on
various datasets validate the effectiveness of LGCF especially in sparse
scenarios. Furthermore, empirical results demonstrate that LGCF provides
complementary information to the embedding-based CF model which can be utilized
to boost recommendation performance.</span>

                                        <span>Ensemble models in E-commerce combine predictions from multiple sub-models
for ranking and revenue improvement. Industrial ensemble models are typically
deep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer
conversion rate given inputs from sub-models. However, this process has the
following two problems. Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the
relationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while
diversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the
learning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize
the revenue. In our work, we propose a new Learning-To-Ensemble (LTE) framework
RAEGO, which replaces the ensemble model with a contextual Rank Aggregator (RA)
and explores the best weights of sub-models by the Evaluator-Generator
Optimization (EGO). To achieve the best online performance, we propose a new
rank aggregation algorithm TournamentGreedy as a refinement of classic rank
aggregators, which also produces the best average weighted Kendall Tau Distance
(KTD) amongst all the considered algorithms with quadratic time complexity.
Under the assumption that the best output list should be Pareto Optimal on the
KTD metric for sub-models, we show that our RA algorithm has higher efficiency
and coverage in exploring the optimal weights. Combined with the idea of
Bayesian Optimization and gradient descent, we solve the online contextual
Black-Box Optimization task that finds the optimal weights for sub-models given
a chosen RA model. RA-EGO has been deployed in our online system and has
improved the revenue significantly.</span>

                                        <span>Greater direct electrification of end-use sectors with a higher share of
renewables is one of the pillars to power a carbon-neutral society by 2050.
However, in contrast to conventional power plants, renewable energy is subject
to uncertainty raising challenges for their interaction with power systems.
Scenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have become an important tool
to equip decision-makers. This paper proposes to present to the power systems
forecasting practitioners a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing
flows, to produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts that are
crucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength
of this technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution
of the underlying process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive
empirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting
Competition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology is competitive with
other state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial
networks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind,
solar power, and load scenarios are properly compared both in terms of forecast
value, by considering the case study of an energy retailer, and quality using
several complementary metrics. The numerical experiments are simple and easily
reproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners
to test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding
on electricity markets, scheduling of power systems with high renewable energy
sources penetration, energy management of virtual power plan or microgrids, and
unit commitment.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks continue to awe the world with their remarkable
performance. Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by
adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to
improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are
focused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a
neural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond
training of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an
adversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We
propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture
search algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,
the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the
smoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a
candidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush
successfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with
a comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive
amount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various
benchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust
accuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy
under AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.</span>

we present AutoVideo, a Python system for automated video action recognition.
It currently supports seven action recognition algorithms and various
pre-processing modules. Unlike the existing libraries that only provide model
zoos, AutoVideo is built with the standard pipeline language. The basic
building block is primitive, which wraps a pre-processing module or an
algorithm with some hyperparameters. AutoVideo is highly modular and
extendable. It can be easily combined with AutoML searchers. The pipeline
language is quite general so that we can easily enrich AutoVideo with
algorithms for various other video-related tasks in the future. AutoVideo is

                                        <span>Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware
segmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on
fluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit
transformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class
membership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of
post-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is
error-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and
nuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to
segment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample
preparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that
operate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on
object detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we
propose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training
set. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale
and segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that
three out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34
backbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the
sample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation
performance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware
segmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,
consistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images
result in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and
sample preparation types.</span>

                                        <span>To reduce the time-to-market and access to state-of-the-art techniques, CNN
hardware mapping and deployment on embedded accelerators are often outsourced
to untrusted third parties, which is going to be more prevalent in futuristic
artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) systems. These AIoT systems anticipate
horizontal collaboration among different resource-constrained AIoT node
devices, where CNN layers are partitioned and these devices collaboratively
compute complex CNN tasks. This horizontal collaboration opens another attack
surface to the CNN-based application, like inserting the hardware Trojans (HT)
into the embedded accelerators designed for the CNN. Therefore, there is a dire
need to explore this attack surface for designing secure embedded hardware
accelerators for CNNs. Towards this goal, in this paper, we exploited this
attack surface to propose an HT-based attack called FeSHI. Since in horizontal
collaboration of RC AIoT devices different sections of CNN architectures are
outsourced to different untrusted third parties, the attacker may not know the
input image, but it has access to the layer-by-layer output feature maps
information for the assigned sections of the CNN architecture. This attack
exploits the statistical distribution, i.e., Gaussian distribution, of the
layer-by-layer feature maps of the CNN to design two triggers for stealthy HT
with a very low probability of triggering. Also, three different novel,
stealthy and effective trigger designs are proposed.</span>

accessible to everyone, with as few barriers as possible; even more so for key
technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). Open
Educational Resources (OER) are a crucial factor for greater educational
equity. In this paper, we describe the specific requirements for OER in ML and
DS and argue that it is especially important for these fields to make source
files publicly available, leading to Open Source Educational Resources (OSER).
We present our view on the collaborative development of OSER, the challenges
this poses, and first steps towards their solutions. We outline how OSER can be
used for blended learning scenarios and share our experiences in university
education. Finally, we discuss additional challenges such as credit assignment
or granting certificates.</span>

                                        <span>Studying the implicit regularization effect of the nonlinear training
dynamics of neural networks (NNs) is important for understanding why
over-parameterized neural networks often generalize well on real dataset.
Empirically, for two-layer NN, existing works have shown that input weights of
hidden neurons (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from
its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) condense on isolated
orientations with a small initialization. The condensation dynamics implies
that NNs can learn features from the training data with a network configuration
effectively equivalent to a much smaller network during the training. In this
work, we show that the multiple roots of activation function at origin
(referred as &#x60;&#x60;multiplicity&#x27;&#x27;) is a key factor for understanding the
condensation at the initial stage of training. Our experiments of multilayer
networks suggest that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the
multiplicity of the activation function used. Our theoretical analysis of
two-layer networks confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the
activation function of multiplicity one, which contains many common activation
functions, and the other is for the one-dimensional input. This work makes a
step towards understanding how small initialization implicitly leads NNs to
condensation at initial training stage, which lays a foundation for the future
study of the nonlinear dynamics of NNs and its implicit regularization effect
at a later stage of training.</span>

                                        <span>In real applications, different computation-resource devices need
different-depth networks (e.g., ResNet-18/34/50) with high-accuracy. Usually,
existing methods either design multiple networks and train them independently,
or construct depth-level/width-level dynamic neural networks which is hard to
prove the accuracy of each sub-net. In this article, we propose an elegant
Depth-Level Dynamic Neural Network (DDNN) integrated different-depth sub-nets
of similar architectures. To improve the generalization of sub-nets, we design
the Embedded-Knowledge-Distillation (EKD) training mechanism for the DDNN to
implement knowledge transfer from the teacher (full-net) to multiple students
(sub-nets). Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to
constrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and
sub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of
different depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of
sub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in
a DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without
extra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet
datasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better
performance than individually training networks while preserving the original
performance of full-nets.</span>

applications, several methods have been developed for explaining their
predictions. So far, these methods have primarily focused on generating
subgraphs that are especially relevant for a particular prediction. However,
such methods do not provide a clear opportunity for recourse: given a
prediction, we want to understand how the prediction can be changed in order to
achieve a more desirable outcome. In this work, we propose a method for
generating counterfactual (CF) explanations for GNNs: the minimal perturbation
to the input (graph) data such that the prediction changes. Using only edge
deletions, we find that our method, CF-GNNExplainer can generate CF
explanations for the majority of instances across three widely used datasets
for GNN explanations, while removing less than 3 edges on average, with at
least 94\% accuracy. This indicates that CF-GNNExplainer primarily removes
edges that are crucial for the original predictions, resulting in minimal CF
explanations.</span>

networks holds the promise of allowing large-scale (decentralized) use of
sensitive data while providing rigorous privacy guarantees to the individual.
The predominant approach to differentially private training of neural networks
is DP-SGD, which relies on norm-based gradient clipping as a method for
bounding sensitivity, followed by the addition of appropriately calibrated
Gaussian noise. In this work we propose NeuralDP, a technique for privatising
activations of some layer within a neural network, which by the post-processing
properties of differential privacy yields a differentially private network. We
experimentally demonstrate on two datasets (MNIST and Pediatric Pneumonia
Dataset (PPD)) that our method offers substantially improved privacy-utility

                                        <span>In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous
driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may
compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have
demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in
detection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although
driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no
comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning
models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial
attacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of
vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep
learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in
vision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving
safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving
safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive
evaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack&#x27;s impact on the driving
safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack&#x27;s impact on the precision of 3D
object detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger
robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we
further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.
The findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial
attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.</span>

increasing statistical power to detect a treatment effect; however, practical
constraints such as privacy considerations may restrict individual-level
information sharing across data sets. This paper develops federated methods
that only utilize summary-level information from heterogeneous data sets. Our
federated methods provide doubly-robust point estimates of treatment effects as
well as variance estimates. We derive the asymptotic distributions of our
federated estimators, which are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the
corresponding estimators from the combined, individual-level data. We show that
to achieve these properties, federated methods should be adjusted based on
conditions such as whether models are correctly specified and stable across
heterogeneous data sets.</span>

                                        <span>Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks
effectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion
distribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive
proposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a
specific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from
releasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic
non-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to
remove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,
we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental
model to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion
distribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is
used to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning
characteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the
first reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work
in both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that
MCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted
feature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG
domains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of
the art by a clear margin under different scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Decision-making often requires accurate estimation of treatment effects from
observational data. This is challenging as outcomes of alternative decisions
are not observed and have to be estimated. Previous methods estimate outcomes
based on unconfoundedness but neglect any constraints that unconfoundedness
imposes on the outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization
framework for estimating average treatment effects that exploits
unconfoundedness. To this end, we formalize unconfoundedness as an
orthogonality constraint, which ensures that the outcomes are orthogonal to the
treatment assignment. This orthogonality constraint is then included in the
loss function via a regularization. Based on our regularization framework, we
develop deep orthogonal networks for unconfounded treatments (DONUT), which
learn outcomes that are orthogonal to the treatment assignment. Using a variety
of benchmark datasets for estimating average treatment effects, we demonstrate
that DONUT outperforms the state-of-the-art substantially.</span>

privacy of individuals involved in process execution, a log may be anonymized.
Such anonymization strives to transform a log so that it satisfies provable
privacy guarantees, while largely maintaining its utility for process analysis.
Existing techniques perform anonymization using simple, syntactic measures to
identify suitable transformation operations. This way, the semantics of the
activities referenced by the events in a trace are neglected, potentially
leading to transformations in which events of unrelated activities are merged.
To avoid this and incorporate the semantics of activities during anonymization,
we propose to instead incorporate a distance measure based on feature learning.
Specifically, we show how embeddings of events enable the definition of a
distance measure for traces to guide event log anonymization. Our experiments
with real-world data indicate that anonymization using this measure, compared
to a syntactic one, yields logs that are closer to the original log in various
dimensions and, hence, have higher utility for process analysis.</span>

in machine learning debugging. Data are collected from two pools, one
containing data with possibly contaminated labels, and the other which is known
to contain only cleanly labeled points. We first formulate a general
statistical algorithm for identifying buggy points and provide rigorous
theoretical guarantees under the assumption that the data follow a linear
model. We then present two case studies to illustrate the results of our
general theory and the dependence of our estimator on clean versus buggy
points. We further propose an algorithm for tuning parameter selection of our
Lasso-based algorithm and provide corresponding theoretical guarantees.
Finally, we consider a two-person &quot;game&quot; played between a bug generator and a
debugger, where the debugger can augment the contaminated data set with cleanly
labeled versions of points in the original data pool. We establish a
theoretical result showing a sufficient condition under which the bug generator
can always fool the debugger. Nonetheless, we provide empirical results showing

capability to learn optimal policy in an end-to-end manner without relying on
feature engineering. However, most approaches assume a fully observable state
space, i.e. fully observable Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In real-world
robotics, this assumption is unpractical, because of issues such as sensor
sensitivity limitations and sensor noise, and the lack of knowledge about
whether the observation design is complete or not. These scenarios lead to
Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). In this paper, we propose
Long-Short-Term-Memory-based Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(LSTM-TD3) by introducing a memory component to TD3, and compare its
performance with other DRL algorithms in both MDPs and POMDPs. Our results
demonstrate the significant advantages of the memory component in addressing
POMDPs, including the ability to handle missing and noisy observation data.</span>

regime so that gradient-based algorithms don&#x27;t blow up. This letter introduces
a simple scenario where an unstably large learning rate scheme leads to a super
fast convergence, with the convergence rate depending only logarithmically on
the condition number of the problem. Our scheme uses a Cyclical Learning Rate
(CLR) where we periodically take one large unstable step and several small
stable steps to compensate for the instability. These findings also help
explain the empirical observations of [Smith and Topin, 2019] where they show
that CLR with a large maximum learning rate can dramatically accelerate
learning and lead to so-called &quot;super-convergence&quot;. We prove that our scheme
excels in the problems where Hessian exhibits a bimodal spectrum and the
eigenvalues can be grouped into two clusters (small and large). The unstably
large step is the key to enabling fast convergence over the small
eigen-spectrum.</span>

legislative documentary of the European Union institutions. It contains
thousands of categories at different levels of specificity and its descriptors
are targeted by legal texts in almost thirty languages. In this work we propose
a unified framework for EuroVoc classification on 22 languages by fine-tuning
modern Transformer-based pretrained language models. We study extensively the
performance of our trained models and show that they significantly improve the
results obtained by a similar tool - JEX - on the same dataset. The code and

learning for linearly-solvable Markov decision processes. Our approach assumes
that the state space is partitioned, and the subtasks consist in moving between
the partitions. We represent value functions on several levels of abstraction,
and use the compositionality of subtasks to estimate the optimal values of the
states in each partition. The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal
value estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a
consequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not
suffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions
have equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared. If
the set of boundary states is smaller than the entire state space, our approach
can have significantly smaller sample complexity than that of a flat learner,
and we validate this empirically in several experiments.</span>

                                        <span>Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional
improvements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to
provide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.
The diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important
characteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this
characteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely
been investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,
abundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an
essential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps
derived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a
set of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different
classes. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a
sufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to
them as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the
optimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes
addressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard
cross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of
unique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set
of valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor
learning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to
show the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose
architectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last
layers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than
MobileNetV3 Large.</span>

outside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent
interest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly
large fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal
information. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on
speculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.
To add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective
because of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test
folds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit
these weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque
and their &#x27;reasoning&#x27; process is uninterpretable. An equally important
limitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only
of the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the
correct(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a
key structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and
build a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner
identifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity
which can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage
mentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA
annotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from
scratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,
S3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent
competitive baselines.</span>

training examples, and a (large) set of unlabeled training examples.
State-of-the-art models can reach within a few percentage points of
fully-supervised training, while requiring 100x less labeled data.

We study a new class of vulnerabilities: poisoning attacks that modify the
unlabeled dataset. In order to be useful, unlabeled datasets are given strictly
less review than labeled datasets, and adversaries can therefore poison them
easily. By inserting maliciously-crafted unlabeled examples totaling just 0.1%
of the dataset size, we can manipulate a model trained on this poisoned dataset
to misclassify arbitrary examples at test time (as any desired label). Our
attacks are highly effective across datasets and semi-supervised learning
methods.

We find that more accurate methods (thus more likely to be used) are
significantly more vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and as such better training
methods are unlikely to prevent this attack. To counter this we explore the
space of defenses, and propose two methods that mitigate our attack.</span>

graph-structured data, showing promising results in various applications such
as node classification, link prediction and network recommendation. In this
paper, we present a new graph attention neural network, namely GIPA, for
attributed graph data learning. GIPA consists of three key components:
attention, feature propagation and aggregation. Specifically, the attention
component introduces a new multi-layer perceptron based multi-head to generate
better non-linear feature mapping and representation than conventional
implementations such as dot-product. The propagation component considers not
only node features but also edge features, which differs from existing GNNs
that merely consider node features. The aggregation component uses a residual
connection to generate the final embedding. We evaluate the performance of GIPA
using the Open Graph Benchmark proteins (ogbn-proteins for short) dataset. The
experimental results reveal that GIPA can beat the state-of-the-art models in
terms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average test ROC-AUC of
$0.8700\pm 0.0010$ and outperforms all the previous methods listed in the

                                        <span>Spectral mixture (SM) kernels comprise a powerful class of kernels for
Gaussian processes (GPs) capable of discovering structurally complex patterns
and modeling negative covariances. Being a linear superposition of
quasi-periodical kernel components, the state-of-the-art SM kernel does not
consider component compression and dependency structures between components. In
this paper, we investigate the benefits of component compression and modeling
of both time and phase delay structures between basis components in the SM
kernel. By verifying the presence of dependencies between function components
using Gaussian conditionals and posterior covariance, we first propose a new SM
kernel variant with a time and phase delay dependency structure (SMD) and then
provide a structure adaptation (SA) algorithm for the SMD. The SMD kernel is
constructed in two steps: first, time delay and phase delay are incorporated
into each basis component; next, cross-convolution between a basis component
and the reversed complex conjugate of another basis component is performed,
which yields a complex-valued and positive definite kernel incorporating
dependency structures between basis components. The model compression and
dependency sparsity of the SMD kernel can be obtained by using automatic
pruning in SA. We perform a thorough comparative experimental analysis of the
SMD on both synthetic and real-life datasets. The results corroborate the
efficacy of the dependency structure and SA in the SMD.</span>

                                        <span>One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent
vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to
trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning
normally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous
data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for
discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly
concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge
this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with
prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines
triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and
descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary;
input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby
optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic
-- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or
fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for
both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph
classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of
security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark
datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA.
We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss
potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have gained momentum based on their accuracy, but their
interpretability is often criticised. As a result, they are labelled as black
boxes. In response, several methods have been proposed in the literature to
explain their predictions. Among the explanatory methods, Shapley values is a
feature attribution method favoured for its robust theoretical foundation.
However, the analysis of feature attributions using Shapley values requires
choosing a baseline that represents the concept of missingness. An arbitrary
choice of baseline could negatively impact the explanatory power of the method
and possibly lead to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we present a
method for choosing a baseline according to a neutrality value: as a parameter
selected by decision-makers, the point at which their choices are determined by
the model predictions being either above or below it. Hence, the proposed
baseline is set based on a parameter that depends on the actual use of the
model. This procedure stands in contrast to how other baselines are set, i.e.
without accounting for how the model is used. We empirically validate our
choice of baseline in the context of binary classification tasks, using two
datasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset derived from the financial domain.</span>

                                        <span>Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often
requires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a
single expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the
inter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert
annotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of
interest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference
estimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural
network, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from
annotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.
U-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the
input images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image
masks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple
experts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the
applicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital
pathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate
models using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images
of human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of
lumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from
intravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based
on U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models
trained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of
multitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.</span>

become important which traces students&#x27; knowledge states based on their
historical practices. Factor analysis methods mainly use two kinds of factors
which are separately related to students and questions to model students&#x27;
knowledge states. These methods use the total number of attempts of students to
model students&#x27; learning progress and hardly highlight the impact of the most
recent relevant practices. Besides, current factor analysis methods ignore rich
information contained in questions. In this paper, we propose Multi-Factors
Aware Dual-Attentional model (MF-DAKT) which enriches question representations
and utilizes multiple factors to model students&#x27; learning progress based on a
dual-attentional mechanism. More specifically, we propose a novel
student-related factor which records the most recent attempts on relevant
concepts of students to highlight the impact of recent exercises. To enrich
questions representations, we use a pre-training method to incorporate two
kinds of question information including questions&#x27; relation and difficulty
level. We also add a regularization term about questions&#x27; difficulty level to
restrict pre-trained question representations to fine-tuning during the process
of predicting students&#x27; performance. Moreover, we apply a dual-attentional
mechanism to differentiate contributions of factors and factor interactions to
final prediction in different practice records. At last, we conduct experiments
on several real-world datasets and results show that MF-DAKT can outperform
existing knowledge tracing methods. We also conduct several studies to validate
the effects of each component of MF-DAKT.</span>

Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network
architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can
handle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output. Deep
learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way
that is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the
student to classic neural network structures, Convolution Neural Networks
(CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU),
General Adversarial Networks (GAN), and reinforcement learning. Application of
these architectures to computer vision, time series, security, natural language
processing (NLP), and data generation will be covered. High-Performance
Computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged
both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus is primarily
upon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction to
mathematical foundations. Readers will use the Python programming language to
implement deep learning using Google TensorFlow and Keras. It is not necessary
to know Python prior to this book; however, familiarity with at least one
programming language is assumed.</span>

nonconvex optimization. Concretely, 1) in the convex setting, the number of
communication rounds of FedPAGE is $O(\frac{N^{3/4}}{S\epsilon})$, improving
the best-known result $O(\frac{N}{S\epsilon})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et
al.,2020) by a factor of $N^{1/4}$, where $N$ is the total number of clients
(usually is very large in federated learning), $S$ is the sampled subset of
clients in each communication round, and $\epsilon$ is the target error; 2) in
the nonconvex setting, the number of communication rounds of FedPAGE is
$O(\frac{\sqrt{N}+S}{S\epsilon^2})$, improving the best-known result
$O(\frac{N^{2/3}}{S^{2/3}\epsilon^2})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al.,2020) by
a factor of $N^{1/6}S^{1/3}$, if the sampled clients $S\leq \sqrt{N}$. Note
that in both settings, the communication cost for each round is the same for
both FedPAGE and SCAFFOLD. As a result, FedPAGE achieves new state-of-the-art
results in terms of communication complexity for both federated convex and
nonconvex optimization.</span>

                                        <span>Errors in measurements are key to weighting the value of data, but are often
neglected in Machine Learning (ML). We show how Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) are able to learn about the context and patterns of signal and noise,
leading to improvements in the performance of classification methods. We
construct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian
distribution, and where the features (the input data) have varying, but known,
levels of noise. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, where
the noises arise as realizations of some random processes whose underlying
distributions are known. The classification of these objects can then be
performed using standard statistical techniques (e.g., least-squares
minimization or Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), as well as ML techniques. This
allows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object
classification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are
incorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that,
when each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e., noises with
different distribution functions), that information can be learned by the CNNs,
raising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least-squares
method -- and sometimes even surpassing it. Furthermore, we show that, with
varying noise levels, the confidence of the ML classifiers serves as a proxy
for the underlying cumulative distribution function, but only if the
information about specific input data uncertainties is provided to the CNNs.</span>

applications of deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose advanced dropout, a
model-free methodology, to mitigate overfitting and improve the performance of
DNNs. The advanced dropout technique applies a model-free and easily
implemented distribution with parametric prior, and adaptively adjusts dropout
rate. Specifically, the distribution parameters are optimized by stochastic
gradient variational Bayes in order to carry out an end-to-end training. We
evaluate the effectiveness of the advanced dropout against nine dropout
techniques on seven computer vision datasets (five small-scale datasets and two
large-scale datasets) with various base models. The advanced dropout
outperforms all the referred techniques on all the datasets.We further compare
the effectiveness ratios and find that advanced dropout achieves the highest
one on most cases. Next, we conduct a set of analysis of dropout rate
characteristics, including convergence of the adaptive dropout rate, the
learned distributions of dropout masks, and a comparison with dropout rate
generation without an explicit distribution. In addition, the ability of
overfitting prevention is evaluated and confirmed. Finally, we extend the
application of the advanced dropout to uncertainty inference, network pruning,
text classification, and regression. The proposed advanced dropout is also
superior to the corresponding referred methods. Codes are available at

                                        <span>Neural-network classifiers achieve high accuracy when predicting the class of
an input that they were trained to identify. Maintaining this accuracy in
dynamic environments, where inputs frequently fall outside the fixed set of
initially known classes, remains a challenge. The typical approach is to detect
inputs from novel classes and retrain the classifier on an augmented dataset.
However, not only the classifier but also the detection mechanism needs to
adapt in order to distinguish between newly learned and yet unknown input
classes. To address this challenge, we introduce an algorithmic framework for
active monitoring of a neural network. A monitor wrapped in our framework
operates in parallel with the neural network and interacts with a human user
via a series of interpretable labeling queries for incremental adaptation. In
addition, we propose an adaptive quantitative monitor to improve precision. An
experimental evaluation on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying numbers of
classes confirms the benefits of our active monitoring framework in dynamic
scenarios.</span>

Then, another gated RNN approximating the model inverse is trained. The

most often due to deviation from standard coding practices on the developers
part during the development phase. Studies observe that code smells made the
code more susceptible to call for modifications and corrections than code that
did not contain code smells. Restructuring the code at the early stage of
development saves the exponentially increasing amount of effort it would
require to address the issues stemming from the presence of these code smells.
Instead of using traditional features to detect code smells, we use user
comments to manually construct features to predict code smells. We use three
Extreme learning machine kernels over 629 packages to identify eight code
smells by leveraging feature engineering aspects and using sampling techniques.
Our findings indicate that the radial basis functional kernel performs best out
of the three kernel methods with a mean accuracy of 98.52.</span>

scientific fields and provided solutions to long standing problems across
multiple application domains. Nevertheless, they also suffer from weaknesses
since their optimal performance depends on massive amounts of training data and
the tuning of an extended number of parameters. As a countermeasure, some
deep-forest methods have been recently proposed, as efficient and low-scale
solutions. Despite that, these approaches simply employ label classification
probabilities as induced features and primarily focus on traditional
classification and regression tasks, leaving multi-output prediction
under-explored. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that tree-embeddings are
highly representative, especially in structured output prediction. In this
direction, we propose a novel deep tree-ensemble (DTE) model, where every layer
enriches the original feature set with a representation learning component
based on tree-embeddings. In this paper, we specifically focus on two
structured output prediction tasks, namely multi-label classification and
multi-target regression. We conducted experiments using multiple benchmark
datasets and the obtained results confirm that our method provides superior
results to state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.</span>

methods in deep reinforcement learning. Next, we discuss deep reinforcement
learning deployment on database systems, facilitating data processing and

                                        <span>In supervised learning, training and test datasets are often sampled from
distinct distributions. Domain adaptation techniques are thus required.
Covariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains
differ only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift
adaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,
according to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous
research argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.
However, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model
performance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,
considering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat
obscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified
theory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a
unified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the
context of covariate shift adaptation. Moreover, we also demonstrate how
dimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue
that our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift
adaptation as a good practice.</span>

exploits a local approximation of the curvature of the likelihood to estimate
the ELBO without the need for stochastic sampling of the neural-network
weights. The Variational Laplace objective is simple to evaluate, as it is (in
essence) the log-likelihood, plus weight-decay, plus a squared-gradient
regularizer. Variational Laplace gave better test performance and expected
calibration errors than maximum a-posteriori inference and standard
sampling-based variational inference, despite using the same variational
approximate posterior. Finally, we emphasise care needed in benchmarking
standard VI as there is a risk of stopping before the variance parameters have
converged. We show that early-stopping can be avoided by increasing the
learning rate for the variance parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Channel attention mechanisms have been commonly applied in many visual tasks
for effective performance improvement. It is able to reinforce the informative
channels as well as to suppress the useless channels. Recently, different
channel attention modules have been proposed and implemented in various ways.
Generally speaking, they are mainly based on convolution and pooling
operations. In this paper, we propose Gaussian process embedded channel
attention (GPCA) module and further interpret the channel attention schemes in
a probabilistic way. The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among
the channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables.
As the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution,
we utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem. To
specify, we adapt a Sigmoid-Gaussian approximation, in which the Gaussian
distributed variables are transferred into the interval [0,1]. The Gaussian
process is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In
this case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can
be efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the
CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed GPCA module. Codes are available at https://github.com/PRIS-CV/GPCA.</span>

                                        <span>Code Smell, similar to a bad smell, is a surface indication of something
tainted but in terms of software writing practices. This metric is an
indication of a deeper problem lies within the code and is associated with an
issue which is prominent to experienced software developers with acceptable
coding practices. Recent studies have often observed that codes having code
smells are often prone to a higher probability of change in the software
development cycle. In this paper, we developed code smell prediction models
with the help of features extracted from source code to predict eight types of
code smell. Our work also presents the application of data sampling techniques
to handle class imbalance problem and feature selection techniques to find
relevant feature sets. Previous studies had made use of techniques such as
Naive - Bayes and Random forest but had not explored deep learning methods to
predict code smell. A total of 576 distinct Deep Learning models were trained

                                        <span>Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm
for recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,
standard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to
capture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either
ignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can
simultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,
i.e. that a user&#x27;s preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic
characteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this
paper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent
user-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired
by translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages
memory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this
joint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on
recommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also
emphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.</span>

improving clinical diagnosis. In breast cancer screening, several recent
studies show that AI has the potential to improve radiologists&#x27; accuracy,
subsequently helping in early cancer diagnosis and reducing unnecessary workup.
As the number of proposed models and their complexity grows, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to re-implement them in order to reproduce the results
and to compare different approaches. To enable reproducibility of research in
this application area and to enable comparison between different methods, we
release a meta-repository containing deep learning models for classification of
screening mammograms. This meta-repository creates a framework that enables the
evaluation of machine learning models on any private or public screening
mammography data set. At its inception, our meta-repository contains five
state-of-the-art models with open-source implementations and cross-platform
compatibility. We compare their performance on five international data sets:
two private New York University breast cancer screening data sets as well as
three public (DDSM, INbreast and Chinese Mammography Database) data sets. Our
framework has a flexible design that can be generalized to other medical image
analysis tasks. The meta-repository is available at

over-sampling methods generate non-diverse synthetic instances within the
convex hull formed by the existing minority instances as they only concentrate
on the minority class and ignore the vast information provided by the majority
class. They also often do not perform well for extremely imbalanced data as the
fewer the minority instances, the less information to generate synthetic
instances. Moreover, existing methods that generate synthetic instances using
the majority class distributional information cannot perform effectively when
the majority class has a multi-modal distribution. We propose a new method to
generate diverse and adaptable synthetic instances using Synthetic
Over-sampling with Minority and Majority classes (SOMM). SOMM generates
synthetic instances diversely within the minority data space. It updates the
generated instances adaptively to the neighbourhood including both classes.
Thus, SOMM performs well for both binary and multiclass imbalance problems. We
examine the performance of SOMM for binary and multiclass problems using
benchmark data sets for different imbalance levels. The empirical results show
the superiority of SOMM compared to other existing methods.</span>

                                        <span>The traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) minimizes the
total distance of the routes under the capacity constraints of the vehicles.
But more often, the objective involves multiple criteria including not only the
total distance of the tour but also other factors such as travel costs, travel
time, and fuel consumption.Moreover, in reality, there are numerous implicit
preferences ingrained in the minds of the route planners and the drivers.
Drivers, for instance, have familiarity with certain neighborhoods and
knowledge of the state of roads, and often consider the best places for rest
and lunch breaks. This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when
operational routing decisions have to be made. This motivates us to learn the
implicit preferences from past solutions and to incorporate these learned
preferences in the optimization process. These preferences are in the form of
arc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint
probability. The novelty of this work is the use of a neural network model to
estimate the arc probabilities, which allows for additional features and
automatic parameter estimation. This first requires identifying suitable
features, neural architectures and loss functions, taking into account that
there is typically few data available. We investigate the difference with a
prior weighted Markov counting approach, and study the applicability of neural
networks in this setting.</span>

for training and evaluating Interactive Navigation: robot navigation strategies
where physical interaction with objects is allowed and even encouraged to
accomplish a task. For example, the robot can move objects if needed in order
to clear a path leading to the goal location. Our benchmark comprises two novel
elements: 1) a new experimental setup, the Interactive Gibson Environment
(iGibson 0.5), which simulates high fidelity visuals of indoor scenes, and high
fidelity physical dynamics of the robot and common objects found in these
scenes; 2) a set of Interactive Navigation metrics which allows one to study
the interplay between navigation and physical interaction. We present and
evaluate multiple learning-based baselines in Interactive Gibson, and provide
insights into regimes of navigation with different trade-offs between
navigation path efficiency and disturbance of surrounding objects. We make our
benchmark publicly

                                        <span>Machine learning for procedural content generation has recently become an
active area of research. Levels vary in both form and function and are mostly
unrelated to each other across games. This has made it difficult to assemble
suitably large datasets to bring machine learning to level design in the same
way as it&#x27;s been used for image generation. Here we propose Generative Playing
Networks which design levels for itself to play. The algorithm is built in two
parts; an agent that learns to play game levels, and a generator that learns
the distribution of playable levels. As the agent learns and improves its
ability, the space of playable levels, as defined by the agent, grows. The
generator targets the agent&#x27;s playability estimates to then update its
understanding of what constitutes a playable level. We call this process of
learning the distribution of data found through self-discovery with an
environment, self-supervised inductive learning. Unlike previous approaches to
procedural content generation, Generative Playing Networks are end-to-end
differentiable and do not require human-designed examples or domain knowledge.
We demonstrate the capability of this framework by training an agent and level
generator for a 2D dungeon crawler game.</span>

traditional problems are resurfaced and readdressed through this new
perspective. The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph
problems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here,
we focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a
\#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We
develop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an
upper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs.
Experiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the
alternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly,
it can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the
predictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates.
To showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization
(IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the
predictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model
that learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE&#x27;s
hidden representations and predictions. The final results show that the
proposed methods surpasses a previous GNN-RL approach and perform on par with a
state-of-the-art IM algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>The transition state (TS) calculation is a grand challenge for computational
intensive energy function. The traditional methods need to evaluate the
gradients of the energy function at a very large number of locations. To reduce
the number of expensive computations of the true gradients, we propose an
active learning framework consisting of a statistical surrogate model, Gaussian
process regression (GPR) for the energy function, and a single-walker dynamics
method, gentle accent dynamics (GAD), for the saddle-type transition states. TS
is detected by the GAD applied to the GPR surrogate for the gradient vector and
the Hessian matrix. Our key ingredient for efficiency improvements is an active
learning method which sequentially designs the most informative locations and
takes evaluations of the original model at these locations to train GPR. We
formulate this active learning task as the optimal experimental design problem
and propose a very efficient sample-based sub-optimal criterion to construct
the optimal locations. We show that the new method significantly decreases the
required number of energy or force evaluations of the original model.</span>

                                        <span>From ultra-sensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and
sensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next-generation technologies to
operate in room temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride
nanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by
allowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from
ambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the
driving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by
machine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that
exhibits vibration modes which are isolated from ambient thermal environments
via a novel &quot;torsional soft-clamping&quot; mechanism discovered by the data-driven
optimization algorithm. This bio-inspired resonator is then fabricated;
experimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors
above 1 billion in room temperature environments. In contrast to other
state-of-the-art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design
which does not require sub-micron lithographic features or complex phononic
bandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large
scales. Here we demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem
with human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new
strategies in computing and nanotechnology.</span>

search queries which are real, accurate, diverse, relevant and engaging.
Obtaining large amounts of query-quality human annotations is expensive. Prior
work on supervised query suggestion models suffered from selection and exposure
bias, and relied on sparse and noisy immediate user-feedback (e.g., clicks),
leading to low quality suggestions. Reinforcement Learning techniques employed
to reformulate a query using terms from search results, have limited
scalability to large-scale industry applications. To recommend high quality
related search queries, we train a Deep Reinforcement Learning model to predict
the query a user would enter next. The reward signal is composed of long-term
session-based user feedback, syntactic relatedness and estimated naturalness of
generated query. Over the baseline supervised model, our proposed approach
achieves a significant relative improvement in terms of recommendation

                                        <span>Being able to learn from complex data with phase information is imperative
for many signal processing applications. Today&#x27; s real-valued deep neural
networks (DNNs) have shown efficiency in latent information analysis but fall
short when applied to the complex domain. Deep complex networks (DCN), in
contrast, can learn from complex data, but have high computational costs;
therefore, they cannot satisfy the instant decision-making requirements of many
deployable systems dealing with short observations or short signal bursts.
Recent, Binarized Complex Neural Network (BCNN), which integrates DCNs with
binarized neural networks (BNN), shows great potential in classifying complex
data in real-time. In this paper, we propose a structural pruning based
accelerator of BCNN, which is able to provide more than 5000 frames/s inference
throughput on edge devices. The high performance comes from both the algorithm
and hardware sides. On the algorithm side, we conduct structural pruning to the
original BCNN models and obtain 20 $\times$ pruning rates with negligible
accuracy loss; on the hardware side, we propose a novel 2D convolution
operation accelerator for the binary complex neural network. Experimental
results show that the proposed design works with over 90% utilization and is
able to achieve the inference throughput of 5882 frames/s and 4938 frames/s for
complex NIN-Net and ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10 dataset and Alveo U280 Board.</span>

                                        <span>Gradient descent (GD) type optimization methods are the standard instrument
to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) with rectified linear unit (ReLU)
activation. Despite the great success of GD type optimization methods in
numerical simulations for the training of ANNs with ReLU activation, it remains
- even in the simplest situation of the plain vanilla GD optimization method
with random initializations and ANNs with one hidden layer - an open problem to
prove (or disprove) the conjecture that the risk of the GD optimization method
converges in the training of such ANNs to zero as the width of the ANNs, the
number of independent random initializations, and the number of GD steps
increase to infinity. In this article we prove this conjecture in the situation
where the probability distribution of the input data is equivalent to the
continuous uniform distribution on a compact interval, where the probability
distributions for the random initializations of the ANN parameters are standard
normal distributions, and where the target function under consideration is
continuous and piecewise affine linear. Roughly speaking, the key ingredients
in our mathematical convergence analysis are (i) to prove that suitable sets of
global minima of the risk functions are \emph{twice continuously differentiable
submanifolds of the ANN parameter spaces}, (ii) to prove that the Hessians of
the risk functions on these sets of global minima satisfy an appropriate
\emph{maximal rank condition}, and, thereafter, (iii) to apply the machinery in

that are significantly smaller than the number of attributes $n$.

Our main result addresses the problem of poly$(n,1/\epsilon)$ time algorithms
with poly$(s,1/\epsilon)$ query complexity (independent of $n$) that
distinguish between functions that are decision trees of size $s$ from
functions that are $\epsilon$-far from any decision tree of size
$\phi(s,1/\epsilon)$, for some function $\phi &gt; s$. The best known result is
the recent one that follows from Blank, Lange and Tan,~\cite{BlancLT20}, that
gives $\phi(s,1/\epsilon)&#x3D;2^{O((\log^3s)/\epsilon^3)}$. In this paper, we give
a new algorithm that achieves $\phi(s,1/\epsilon)&#x3D;2^{O(\log^2 (s/\epsilon))}$.

Moreover, we study the testability of depth-$d$ decision tree and give a {\it
distribution free} tester that distinguishes between depth-$d$ decision tree
and functions that are $\epsilon$-far from depth-$d^2$ decision tree. In
particular, for decision trees of size $s$, the above result holds in the
distribution-free model when the tree depth is $O(\log(s/\epsilon))$.

We also give other new results in learning and testing of size-$s$ decision
trees and depth-$d$ decision trees that follow from results in the literature
and some results we prove in this paper.</span>

achieved comparable performance to supervised approaches, violations of the
static world assumption can still lead to erroneous depth predictions of
traffic participants, posing a potential safety issue. In this paper, we
present R4Dyn, a novel set of techniques to use cost-efficient radar data on
top of a self-supervised depth estimation framework. In particular, we show how
radar can be used during training as weak supervision signal, as well as an
extra input to enhance the estimation robustness at inference time. Since
automotive radars are readily available, this allows to collect training data
from a variety of existing vehicles. Moreover, by filtering and expanding the
signal to make it compatible with learning-based approaches, we address radar
inherent issues, such as noise and sparsity. With R4Dyn we are able to overcome
a major limitation of self-supervised depth estimation, i.e. the prediction of
traffic participants. We substantially improve the estimation on dynamic
objects, such as cars by 37% on the challenging nuScenes dataset, hence
demonstrating that radar is a valuable additional sensor for monocular depth
estimation in autonomous vehicles. Additionally, we plan on making the code
publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Correlation Clustering is an important clustering problem with many
applications. We study the reconstruction version of this problem in which one
is seeking to reconstruct a latent clustering that has been corrupted by random
noise and adversarial modifications.

Concerning the latter, we study a standard &quot;post-adversarial&quot; model, in which
adversarial modifications come after the noise, and also introduce and analyze
a &quot;pre-adversarial&quot; model in which adversarial modifications come before the
noise. Given an input coming from such a semi-adversarial generative model, the
goal is to reconstruct almost perfectly and with high probability the latent
clustering.

We focus on the case where the hidden clusters have equal size and show the
following. In the pre-adversarial setting, spectral algorithms are optimal, in
the sense that they reconstruct all the way to the information-theoretic
threshold beyond which no reconstruction is possible. In contrast, in the
post-adversarial setting their ability to restore the hidden clusters stops
before the threshold, but the gap is optimally filled by SDP-based algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate
in the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based
on some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,
these single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for
tasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To
this end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that
accurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object
detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth
estimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at
different semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or
conflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can
provide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate
the task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based
on the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the
neural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using
untargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact
amongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we
show that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric
and their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level
representations.</span>

                                        <span>The Oxford English Dictionary defines precision medicine as &quot;medical care
designed to optimize efficiency or therapeutic benefit for particular groups of
patients, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.&quot; It is not an
entirely new idea: physicians from ancient times have recognized that medical
treatment needs to consider individual variations in patient characteristics.
However, the modern precision medicine movement has been enabled by a
confluence of events: scientific advances in fields such as genetics and
pharmacology, technological advances in mobile devices and wearable sensors,
and methodological advances in computing and data sciences.

This chapter is about bandit algorithms: an area of data science of special
relevance to precision medicine. With their roots in the seminal work of
Bellman, Robbins, Lai and others, bandit algorithms have come to occupy a
central place in modern data science ( Lattimore and Szepesvari, 2020). Bandit
algorithms can be used in any situation where treatment decisions need to be
made to optimize some health outcome. Since precision medicine focuses on the
use of patient characteristics to guide treatment, contextual bandit algorithms
are especially useful since they are designed to take such information into
account. The role of bandit algorithms in areas of precision medicine such as
mobile health and digital phenotyping has been reviewed before (Tewari and
Murphy, 2017; Rabbi et al., 2019). Since these reviews were published, bandit
algorithms have continued to find uses in mobile health and several new topics
have emerged in the research on bandit algorithms. This chapter is written for
quantitative researchers in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and
operations research who might be interested in knowing more about the
algorithmic and mathematical details of bandit algorithms that have been used
in mobile health.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative training of neural networks leverages distributed data by
exchanging gradient information between different clients. Although training
data entirely resides with the clients, recent work shows that training data
can be reconstructed from such exchanged gradient information. To enhance
privacy, gradient perturbation techniques have been proposed. However, they
come at the cost of reduced model performance, increased convergence time, or
increased data demand. In this paper, we introduce PRECODE, a PRivacy EnhanCing
mODulE that can be used as generic extension for arbitrary model architectures.
We propose a simple yet effective realization of PRECODE using variational
modeling. The stochastic sampling induced by variational modeling effectively
prevents privacy leakage from gradients and in turn preserves privacy of data
owners. We evaluate PRECODE using state of the art gradient inversion attacks
on two different model architectures trained on three datasets. In contrast to
commonly used defense mechanisms, we find that our proposed modification
consistently reduces the attack success rate to 0% while having almost no
negative impact on model training and final performance. As a result, PRECODE
reveals a promising path towards privacy enhancing model extensions.</span>

                                        <span>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits strong algorithmic regularization
effects in practice, which has been hypothesized to play an important role in
the generalization of modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we seek
to understand these issues in the simpler setting of linear regression
(including both underparameterized and overparameterized regimes), where our
goal is to make sharp instance-based comparisons of the implicit regularization
afforded by (unregularized) average SGD with the explicit regularization of
ridge regression. For a broad class of least squares problem instances (that
are natural in high-dimensional settings), we show: (1) for every problem
instance and for every ridge parameter, (unregularized) SGD, when provided with
logarithmically more samples than that provided to the ridge algorithm,
generalizes no worse than the ridge solution (provided SGD uses a tuned
constant stepsize); (2) conversely, there exist instances (in this wide problem
class) where optimally-tuned ridge regression requires quadratically more
samples than SGD in order to have the same generalization performance. Taken
together, our results show that, up to the logarithmic factors, the
generalization performance of SGD is always no worse than that of ridge
regression in a wide range of overparameterized problems, and, in fact, could
be much better for some problem instances. More generally, our results show how
algorithmic regularization has important consequences even in simpler
(overparameterized) convex settings.</span>

data privacy preservation i.e., local data remain private throughout the entire

because it allows one to use machine learning techniques while preserving
privacy. However, it inherits the vulnerabilities and susceptibilities raised
in deep learning techniques. For instance, Federated Learning is particularly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and
integrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In
addition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due
to the non-Independently and/or Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. The
real-world data can be complex and diverse, making them hardly distinguishable
from the malicious data without direct access to the raw data. Prior research
has focused on detecting malicious clients while treating only the clients
having IID data as benign. In this study, we propose a method that detects and
classifies anomalous clients from benign clients when benign ones have non-IID
data. Our proposed method leverages feature dimension reduction, dynamic
clustering, and cosine similarity-based clipping. The experimental results
validates that our proposed method not only classifies the malicious clients
but also alleviates their negative influences from the entire procedure. Our
findings may be used in future studies to effectively eliminate anomalous
clients when building a model with diverse data.</span>

                                        <span>Decentralized optimization and communication compression have exhibited their
great potential in accelerating distributed machine learning by mitigating the
communication bottleneck in practice. While existing decentralized algorithms
with communication compression mostly focus on the problems with only smooth
components, we study the decentralized stochastic composite optimization
problem with a potentially non-smooth component. A \underline{Prox}imal
gradient \underline{L}in\underline{EA}r convergent \underline{D}ecentralized
algorithm with compression, Prox-LEAD, is proposed with rigorous theoretical
analyses in the general stochastic setting and the finite-sum setting. Our
theorems indicate that Prox-LEAD works with arbitrary compression precision,
and it tremendously reduces the communication cost almost for free. The
superiorities of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated through the
comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence
complexities and numerical experiments. Our algorithmic framework also
generally enlightens the compressed communication on other primal-dual
algorithms by reducing the impact of inexact iterations, which might be of
independent interest.</span>

machine learning in medical imaging. We start with a short summary of the
general developments of the past in machine learning and how general and
specialized approaches have been in competition in the past decades. A
particular focus will be the theoretical and experimental evidence pro and
contra hybrid modelling. Next, we inspect several new developments regarding
hybrid machine learning with a particular focus on so-called known operator
learning and how hybrid approaches gain more and more momentum across
essentially all applications in medical imaging and medical image analysis. As
we will point out by numerous examples, hybrid models are taking over in image
reconstruction and analysis. Even domains such as physical simulation and
scanner and acquisition design are being addressed using machine learning grey
box modelling approaches. Towards the end of the article, we will investigate a
few future directions and point out relevant areas in which hybrid modelling,
meta learning, and other domains will likely be able to drive the

                                        <span>Big Data are rapidly produced from various heterogeneous data sources. They
are of different types (text, image, video or audio) and have different levels
of reliability and completeness. One of the most interesting architectures that
deal with the large amount of emerging data at high velocity is called the
lambda architecture. In fact, it combines two different processing layers
namely batch and speed layers, each providing specific views of data while
ensuring robustness, fast and scalable data processing. However, most papers
dealing with the lambda architecture are focusing one single type of data
generally produced by a single data source. Besides, the layers of the
architecture are implemented independently, or, at best, are combined to
perform basic processing without assessing either the data reliability or
completeness. Therefore, inspired by the lambda architecture, we propose in
this paper a generic multimodal architecture that combines both batch and
streaming processing in order to build a complete, global and accurate insight
in near-real-time based on the knowledge extracted from multiple heterogeneous
Big Data sources. Our architecture uses batch processing to analyze the data
structures and contents, build the learning models and calculate the
reliability index of the involved sources, while the streaming processing uses
the built-in models of the batch layer to immediately process incoming data and
rapidly provide results. We validate our architecture in the context of urban
traffic management systems in order to detect congestions.</span>

                                        <span>Recent technology development brings the booming of numerous new
Demand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand
delivery, express systems and warehousing. In DDS, a service loop is an
elemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and
corresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either
humans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning
tasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1)
Dispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,
and 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the
constructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is
important to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is
a powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model
without relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term
effect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS,
then highlight common applications and important decision/control problems
within. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL
solutions, and further summarize them in
\textit{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DDS\_Survey}. We also introduce
open simulation environments for development and evaluation of DDS
applications. Finally, we analyze remaining challenges and discuss further
research opportunities in DRL solutions for DDS.</span>

                                        <span>Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,
accomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters
in a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the
search phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be
selected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the
values of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much
has been discussed about the supernet&#x27;s optimization, the architecture
selection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and
theoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does
not necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet&#x27;s
performance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture
selection that directly measures each operation&#x27;s influence on the supernet. We
re-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture
selection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved
architectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find
that several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed
selection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in
DARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture
selection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.</span>

                                        <span>Several decades ago the Proximal Point Algorithm (PPA) started to gain much
attraction for both abstract operator theory and the numerical optimization
communities. Even in modern applications, researchers still use proximal
minimization theory to design scalable algorithms that overcome nonsmoothness
in high dimensional models. Several remarkable references as
\cite{Fer:91,Ber:82constrained,Ber:89parallel,Tom:11} analyzed the tight local
relations between the convergence rate of PPA and the regularity of the
objective function. However, without taking into account the concrete
computational effort paid for computing each PPA iteration, any iteration
complexity remains abstract and purely informative. In this manuscript we aim
to evaluate the computational complexity of practical PPA in terms of
(proximal) gradient/subgradient iterations, which might allow a fair
positioning of the famous PPA numerical performance in the class of first order
methods. First, we derive nonasymptotic iteration complexity estimates of exact
and inexact PPA to minimize convex functions under $\gamma-$Holderian growth:
$\BigO{\log(1/\epsilon)}$ (for $\gamma \in [1,2]$) and
$\BigO{1/\epsilon^{\gamma - 2}}$ (for $\gamma &gt; 2$). In particular, we recover
well-known results on exact PPA: finite convergence for sharp minima and linear
convergence for quadratic growth, even under presence of inexactness. Second,
assuming that an usual (proximal) gradient/subgradient method subroutine is
employed to compute inexact PPA iteration, we show novel computational
complexity bounds on a restarted variant of the inexact PPA, available when no
information on the growth of the objective function is known. In the numerical
experiments we confirm the practical performance and implementability of our
schemes.</span>

to classify suspicious breast nodules and potentially detect the onset of
breast cancer. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have
shown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into
benign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as
such, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort
has been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM
and other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of
CNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important
information, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this
work, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may
be devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will
show that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering
the classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care
must be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner
workings of deep learning. Finally, we utilize Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and
propose a new network based on ResNet-50 to improve the classification
accuracies. Our sensitivity and specificity is comparable to the state of the
art results.</span>

students&#x27; knowledge mastery over time so as to make predictions on their future
performance. Owing to the good representation capacity of deep neural networks
(DNNs), recent advances on KT have increasingly concentrated on exploring DNNs
to improve the performance of KT. However, we empirically reveal that the DNNs
based KT models may run the risk of overfitting, especially on small datasets,
leading to limited generalization. In this paper, by leveraging the current
advances in adversarial training (AT), we propose an efficient AT based KT
method (ATKT) to enhance KT model&#x27;s generalization and thus push the limit of
KT. Specifically, we first construct adversarial perturbations and add them on
the original interaction embeddings as adversarial examples. The original and
adversarial examples are further used to jointly train the KT model, forcing it
is not only to be robust to the adversarial examples, but also to enhance the
generalization over the original ones. To better implement AT, we then present
an efficient attentive-LSTM model as KT backbone, where the key is a proposed
knowledge hidden state attention module that adaptively aggregates information
from previous knowledge hidden states while simultaneously highlighting the
importance of current knowledge hidden state to make a more accurate
prediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our ATKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at:

                                        <span>Radio-frequency fingerprints~(RFFs) are promising solutions for realizing
low-cost physical layer authentication. Machine learning-based methods have
been proposed for RFF extraction and discrimination. However, most existing
methods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices is
remains unchanged. These methods can not be generalized to the RFF
discrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from
both known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning
framework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework
comprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization~(NS),
which incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an
inductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to
traditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module
estimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the
RFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to
further improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such
a data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between
device identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance.
Experimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms
purely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of
both discrimination and network generalizability.</span>

linear algebra and the theories behind them. Our goal is to give a rigorous
introduction to the readers with prior exposure to linear algebra.
Specifically, we provide some details and proofs of some results from (Strang,

different views and find the properties and relationships behind the views. The
fundamental theorem of linear algebra is essential in many fields, such as
electrical engineering, computer science, machine learning, and deep learning.
This survey is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important
theories behind it.

The sole aim of this survey is to give a self-contained introduction to
concepts and mathematical tools in theory behind the fundamental theorem of
linear algebra and rigorous analysis in order to seamlessly introduce its
properties in four subspaces in subsequent sections. However, we clearly
realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results and given
the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis
of the (orthogonal) projection matrices. We refer the reader to literature in
the field of linear algebra for a more detailed introduction to the related

and flexible non-linear transition functions, have overtaken the dynamic
Bayesian networks such as the hidden Markov models (HMMs) in the task of
modeling highly structured sequential data. These data, such as from speech and
handwriting, often contain complex relationships between the underlaying
variational factors and the observed data. The standard RNN model has very
limited randomness or variability in its structure, coming from the output
conditional probability model. This paper will present different ways of using
high level latent random variables in RNN to model the variability in the
sequential data, and the training method of such RNN model under the VAE
(Variational Autoencoder) principle. We will explore possible ways of using
adversarial method to train a variational RNN model. Contrary to competing
approaches, our approach has theoretical optimum in the model training and
provides better model training stability. Our approach also improves the
posterior approximation in the variational inference network by a separated
adversarial training step. Numerical results simulated from TIMIT speech data
show that reconstruction loss and evidence lower bound converge to the same
level and adversarial training loss converges to 0.</span>

                                        <span>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in Bangladesh, and as
a result, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is widespread in the population. DR, an eye
illness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and
treated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically
trained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to
its population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting
many from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we
introduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.
We use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on
retinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the
algorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for
Bangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of
retinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in
Bangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening
Bangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,
and can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall
accuracy of 92.27\% and 93.02\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The
results confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical
settings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics. Our
algorithm is implemented in the application Drishti, which is used to screen
for DR in patients living in rural areas in Bangladesh, where access to
professional screening is limited.</span>

Adaption framework for sketch-to-photo synthesis. The unsupervised open domain
adaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is
challenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The
absence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the
freehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that
learns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the
missing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between
synthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings
may produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking
classes. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain
sampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering
false drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo
and photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On
the Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most
current competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model
outperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and
retaining the structural layout.</span>

represented as an infinite-dimensional, linear operator acting on a Hilbert
space of observables of the system. However, determining the relevant modes and
eigenvalues of this infinite-dimensional operator can be difficult. The
extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is one such method for generating
approximations to Koopman spectra and modes, but the EDMD method faces its own
set of challenges due to the need of user defined observables. To address this
issue, we explore the use of convolutional autoencoder networks to
simultaneously find optimal families of observables which also generate both
accurate embeddings of the flow into a space of observables and immersions of
the observables back into flow coordinates. This network results in a global
transformation of the flow and affords future state prediction via EDMD and the
decoder network. We call this method deep learning dynamic mode decomposition
(DLDMD). The method is tested on canonical nonlinear data sets and is shown to
produce results that outperform a standard DMD approach.</span>

                                        <span>Time series has wide applications in the real world and is known to be
difficult to forecast. Since its statistical properties change over time, its
distribution also changes temporally, which will cause severe distribution
shift problem to existing methods. However, it remains unexplored to model the
time series in the distribution perspective. In this paper, we term this as
Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS). This paper proposes Adaptive RNNs (AdaRNN) to
tackle the TCS problem by building an adaptive model that generalizes well on
the unseen test data. AdaRNN is sequentially composed of two novel algorithms.
First, we propose Temporal Distribution Characterization to better characterize
the distribution information in the TS. Second, we propose Temporal
Distribution Matching to reduce the distribution mismatch in TS to learn the
adaptive TS model. AdaRNN is a general framework with flexible distribution
distances integrated. Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality
prediction, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms the latest
methods by a classification accuracy of 2.6% and significantly reduces the RMSE
by 9.0%. We also show that the temporal distribution matching algorithm can be
extended in Transformer structure to boost its performance.</span>

                                        <span>The task of skeleton-based action recognition remains a core challenge in
human-centred scene understanding due to the multiple granularities and large
variation in human motion. Existing approaches typically employ a single neural
representation for different motion patterns, which has difficulty in capturing
fine-grained action classes given limited training data. To address the
aforementioned problems, we propose a novel multi-granular spatio-temporal
graph network for skeleton-based action classification that jointly models the
coarse- and fine-grained skeleton motion patterns. To this end, we develop a
dual-head graph network consisting of two interleaved branches, which enables
us to extract features at two spatio-temporal resolutions in an effective and
efficient manner. Moreover, our network utilises a cross-head communication
strategy to mutually enhance the representations of both heads. We conducted
extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU
RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-Skeleton, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance
on all the benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness of our method.</span>

                                        <span>The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spike tensors is an
important problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However,
previous works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive
incoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this
paper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent
orthogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical
guarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the
principal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix
unfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix
folding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as
an initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP
decomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates
the basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying
projections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by others CP
components in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least
squares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for
tensors with low or moderately high CP ranks. Our theoretical investigation
provides estimation accuracy and statistical convergence rates for the two
proposed algorithms. Our implementations on synthetic data demonstrate
significant practical superiority of our approach over existing methods.</span>

application domains. Usually, a well-performing ML model, especially, emerging
deep neural network model, relies on a large volume of training data and
high-powered computational resources. The need for a vast volume of available
data raises serious privacy concerns because of the risk of leakage of highly
privacy-sensitive information and the evolving regulatory environments that
increasingly restrict access to and use of privacy-sensitive data. Furthermore,
a trained ML model may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as
membership/property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,
well-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are crucial and have
attracted increasing research interest from academia and industry. More and
more efforts of PPML are proposed via integrating privacy-preserving techniques
into ML algorithms, fusing privacy-preserving approaches into ML pipeline, or
designing various privacy-preserving architectures for existing ML systems. In
particular, existing PPML arts cross-cut ML, system, security, and privacy;
hence, there is a critical need to understand state-of-art studies, related
challenges, and a roadmap for future research. This paper systematically
reviews and summarizes existing privacy-preserving approaches and proposes a
PGU model to guide evaluation for various PPML solutions through elaborately
decomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities. The PGU model is designed
as the triad of Phase, Guarantee, and technical Utility. Furthermore, we also
discuss the unique characteristics and challenges of PPML and outline possible
directions of future work that benefit a wide range of research communities
among ML, distributed systems, security, and privacy areas.</span>

                                        <span>The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated
with image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,
rather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),
task amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific
image quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using
reinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,
such as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we
develop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability
of both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on
high-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning
strategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm
facilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image
quality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including
different images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates
that the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to
predict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small
set of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate
cancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks
show that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as
respective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve
comparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training
dataset with 100% expert labels.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning models achieve strong performance for radiology image
classification, but their practical application is bottlenecked by the need for
large labeled training datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches
leverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer
potential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a
novel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic
graphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated
via a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby
eliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be
customized to handle a range of challenges in radiology image classification.
Specifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni
and multi-label classification, and class distribution mismatch between labeled
and unlabeled portions of the training data. In realistic empirical evaluations
on three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of
radiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the
fully supervised AUROC with less than 5-15% labeling budget. Further, NoTeacher
outperforms established SSL methods with minimal hyperparameter tuning, and has
implications as a principled and practical option for semisupervised learning
in radiology applications.</span>

                                        <span>For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer
vision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic
computational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.
There has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in
this context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and
hit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only
inductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is
still a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the
architecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.
A way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another
way is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.
With this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while
reducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other
MLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of
computational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In
addition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to
replace CNNs by adopting inductive bias. The source code in PyTorch version is

for real time semantic image segmentation. Our network incorporates spatial and
channel information using Spatial Attention (SA) and Channel Attention (CA)
modules respectively. It also uses dense local multi-scale context information
using Multi Scale Context (MSC) module. The feature maps are concatenated
individually to produce the final segmentation map. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method using a comprehensive analysis, quantitative
experimental results and ablation study using Cityscapes, ADE20K and Camvid
datasets. Our network performs better than most previous architectures with a
74.4\% Mean IOU on Cityscapes test dataset while running at 202.7 FPS.</span>

                                        <span>With the ever-increasing prevalence of web APIs (Application Programming
Interfaces) in enabling smart software developments, finding and composing a
list of existing web APIs that can corporately fulfil the software developers&#x27;
functional needs have become a promising way to develop a successful mobile
app, economically and conveniently. However, the big volume and diversity of
candidate web APIs put additional burden on the app developers&#x27; web APIs
selection decision-makings, since it is often a challenging task to
simultaneously guarantee the diversity and compatibility of the finally
selected a set of web APIs. Considering this challenge, a Diversity-aware and
Compatibility-driven web APIs Recommendation approach, namely DivCAR, is put
forward in this paper. First, to achieve diversity, DivCAR employs random walk
sampling technique on a pre-built correlation graph to generate diverse
correlation subgraphs. Afterwards, with the diverse correlation subgraphs, we
model the compatible web APIs recommendation problem to be a minimum group
Steiner tree search problem. Through solving the minimum group Steiner tree
search problem, manifold sets of compatible and diverse web APIs ranked are
returned to the app developers. At last, we design and enact a set of
experiments on a real-world dataset crawled from www.programmableWeb.com.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
DivCAR approach in balancing the web APIs recommendation diversity and
compatibility.</span>

based on the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations of
forward-backward diffusion type on complete graphs. The proposed natural
numerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature
conservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using
satellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion
causes the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The
opposite effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward
diffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical
network contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of
the method. After learning parameters and optimizing the topology of the
network graph, classification necessary for habitat identification is
performed. A relevancy map for each habitat is introduced as a tool for
validating the classification and finding new Natura 2000 habitat appearances.</span>

                                        <span>Touchless computer interaction has become an important consideration during
the COVID-19 pandemic period. Despite progress in machine learning and computer
vision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection
of such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them
in a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still
missing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application. This
application utilises published open-source libraries and additional gesture
definitions developed to take the video stream from a standard RGB webcam as
input. It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing
applications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of
interacting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand
gesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial
movements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a
series of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers,
including gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D
RGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions,
winking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the
development of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software,
and gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated
and provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and
keyboard controls in Windows via DirectX. With ease of access to webcams
integrated into most laptops and desktop computers, touchless computing becomes
more available with MotionInput v2.0, in a federated and locally processed
method.</span>

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, many studies have
proposed machine learning techniques for detecting COVID-19 from medical
imaging. The purpose of this study is to systematically review, assess, and
synthesize research articles that have used different machine learning
techniques to detect and diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT scan images.
A structured literature search was conducted in the relevant bibliographic
databases to ensure that the survey solely centered on reproducible and
high-quality research. We selected papers based on our inclusion criteria. In
this survey, we reviewed $98$ articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.
We have surveyed a complete pipeline of chest imaging analysis techniques
related to COVID-19, including data collection, pre-processing, feature
extraction, classification, and visualization. We have considered CT scans and
X-rays as both are widely used to describe the latest developments in medical
imaging to detect COVID-19. This survey provides researchers with valuable
insights into different machine learning techniques and their performance in
the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest imaging. At the end, the
challenges and limitations in detecting COVID-19 using machine learning
techniques and the future direction of research are discussed.</span>

                                        <span>The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of
the olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The
lack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its
challenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition
techniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual
annotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for
solving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably
assess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and
fully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on
sub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we
designed a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both
OBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized
region through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning
architecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual
information, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline
exhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,
and volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the
Rhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent
dataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
with different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases
at the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.
We extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation
accuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively
replicate age effects.</span>

                                        <span>Analysing correlations between streams of events is an important problem. It
arises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be
inferred from spike trains that record neurons&#x27; individual spiking activity.
While recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have
been proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they
are able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper
proposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed
correlated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in
spiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first
computes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays
between subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for
the distribution of inter-spike delays for \emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.
Finally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this
null model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson&#x27;s Chi-squared
test statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori
unknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might
vary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential
for being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the
advantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special
case) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for
neuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.</span>

                                        <span>The Influenza virus can be considered as one of the most severe viruses that
can infect multiple species with often fatal consequences to the hosts. The
Hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus can be a target for antiviral drug
development realised through accurate identification of its sub-types and
possible the targeted hosts. This paper focuses on accurately predicting if an
Influenza type A virus can infect specific hosts, and more specifically, Human,
Avian and Swine hosts, using only the protein sequence of the HA gene. In more
detail, we propose encoding the protein sequences into numerical signals using
the Hydrophobicity Index and subsequently utilising a Convolutional Neural
Network-based predictive model. The Influenza HA protein sequences used in the
proposed work are obtained from the Influenza Research Database (IRD).
Specifically, complete and unique HA protein sequences were used for avian,
human and swine hosts. The data obtained for this work was 17999 human-host
proteins, 17667 avian-host proteins and 9278 swine-host proteins. Given this
set of collected proteins, the proposed method yields as much as 10% higher
accuracy for an individual class (namely, Avian) and 5% higher overall accuracy
than in an earlier study. It is also observed that the accuracy for each class
in this work is more balanced than what was presented in this earlier study. As
the results show, the proposed model can distinguish HA protein sequences with
high accuracy whenever the virus under investigation can infect Human, Avian or
Swine hosts.</span>

                                        <span>Geohazards such as landslides have caused great losses to the safety of
people&#x27;s lives and property, which is often accompanied with surface cracks. If
such surface cracks could be identified in time, it is of great significance
for the monitoring and early warning of geohazards. Currently, the most common
method for crack identification is manual detection, which is with low
efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, a deep transfer learning framework is
proposed to effectively and efficiently identify slope surface cracks for the
sake of fast monitoring and early warning of geohazards such as landslides. The
essential idea is to employ transfer learning by training (a) the large sample
dataset of concrete cracks and (b) the small sample dataset of soil and rock
masses cracks. In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification
models are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks;
(2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the
small sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks. The proposed framework
could be applied to conduct UAV surveys on high-steep slopes to realize the
monitoring and early warning of landslides to ensure the safety of people&#x27;s
lives and property.</span>

attribute-object concepts, notably for composite concepts that are unseen
during model training. We aim to explore the three key properties required by
the task --- relation-aware, consistent, and decoupled --- to learn rich and
robust features for primitive concepts that compose attribute-object pairs. To
this end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model
consists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful
features for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual
features for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing
mechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between
primitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards
seen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and
objects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information
available to the model for both seen and unseen concepts. Extensive experiments
and ablation studies on two benchmarks show the efficacy of the proposed model.</span>

applications are gaining a lot of momentum, and they will surely become
increasingly popular in the next decade. These new applications, however,
require a step forward also in terms of models to simulate and analyze this
type of traffic sources in modern communication networks, in order to guarantee
to the users state of the art performance and Quality of Experience (QoE).
Recognizing this need, in this work, we present a novel open-source traffic
model, which researchers can use as a starting point both for improvements of
the model itself and for the design of optimized algorithms for the
transmission of these peculiar data flows. Along with the mathematical model
and the code, we also share with the community the traces that we gathered for
our study, collected from freely available applications such as Minecraft VR,
Google Earth VR, and Virus Popper. Finally, we propose a roadmap for the
construction of an end-to-end framework that fills this gap in the current

engaging stories remains challenging and requires non-trivial video editing
expertise. Many video editing components are astonishingly hard to automate
primarily due to the lack of raw video materials. This paper focuses on a new
task for computational video editing, namely the task of raking cut
plausibility. Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited
to learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we
first collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract
more than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real
and artificial cuts via contrastive learning. We set up a new task and a set of
baselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model
outperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in
real-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited
videos. The results show that our model does a better job at cutting than
random and alternative baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks
effectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion
distribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive
proposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a
specific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from
releasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic
non-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to
remove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,
we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental
model to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion
distribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is
used to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning
characteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the
first reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work
in both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that
MCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted
feature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG
domains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of
the art by a clear margin under different scenarios.</span>
