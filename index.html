                                        <span>Privacy preservation remains a key challenge in data mining and Natural
Language Understanding (NLU). Previous research shows that the input text or
even text embeddings can leak private information. This concern motivates our
research on effective privacy preservation approaches for pretrained Language
Models (LMs). We investigate the privacy and utility implications of applying
dx-privacy, a variant of Local Differential Privacy, to BERT fine-tuning in NLU
applications. More importantly, we further propose privacy-adaptive LM
pretraining methods and show that our approach can boost the utility of BERT
dramatically while retaining the same level of privacy protection. We also
quantify the level of privacy preservation and provide guidance on privacy
configuration. Our experiments and findings lay the groundwork for future
explorations of privacy-preserving NLU with pretrained LMs.</span>

                                        <span>The rise of personal assistants has made conversational question answering
(ConvQA) a very popular mechanism for user-system interaction. State-of-the-art
methods for ConvQA over knowledge graphs (KGs) can only learn from crisp
question-answer pairs found in popular benchmarks. In reality, however, such
training data is hard to come by: users would rarely mark answers explicitly as
correct or wrong. In this work, we take a step towards a more natural learning
paradigm - from noisy and implicit feedback via question reformulations. A
reformulation is likely to be triggered by an incorrect system response,
whereas a new follow-up question could be a positive signal on the previous
turn&#x27;s answer. We present a reinforcement learning model, termed CONQUER, that
can learn from a conversational stream of questions and reformulations. CONQUER
models the answering process as multiple agents walking in parallel on the KG,
where the walks are determined by actions sampled using a policy network. This
policy network takes the question along with the conversational context as
inputs and is trained via noisy rewards obtained from the reformulation
likelihood. To evaluate CONQUER, we create and release ConvRef, a benchmark
with about 11k natural conversations containing around 205k reformulations.
Experiments show that CONQUER successfully learns to answer conversational
questions from noisy reward signals, significantly improving over a
state-of-the-art baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Conversation generation as a challenging task in Natural Language Generation
(NLG) has been increasingly attracting attention over the last years. A number
of recent works adopted sequence-to-sequence structures along with external
knowledge, which successfully enhanced the quality of generated conversations.
Nevertheless, few works utilized the knowledge extracted from similar
conversations for utterance generation. Taking conversations in customer
service and court debate domains as examples, it is evident that essential
entities/phrases, as well as their associated logic and inter-relationships can
be extracted and borrowed from similar conversation instances. Such information
could provide useful signals for improving conversation generation. In this
paper, we propose a novel reading and memory framework called Deep Reading
Memory Network (DRMN) which is capable of remembering useful information of
similar conversations for improving utterance generation. We apply our model to
two large-scale conversation datasets of justice and e-commerce fields.
Experiments prove that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Electronic Medical Records contain clinical narrative text that is of great
potential value to medical researchers. However, this information is mixed with
Personally Identifiable Information that presents risks to patient and
clinician confidentiality. This paper presents an end-to-end de-identification
framework to automatically remove PII from hospital discharge summaries. Our
corpus included 600 hospital discharge summaries which were extracted from the
EMRs of two principal referral hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Our end-to-end
de-identification framework consists of three components: 1) Annotation:
labelling of PII in the hospital discharge summaries using five pre-defined
categories: person, address, date of birth, individual identification number,
phone/fax number; 2) Modelling: training six named entity recognition deep
learning base-models on balanced and imbalanced datasets; and evaluating
ensembles that combine all six base-models, the three base-models with the best
F1 scores and the three base-models with the best recall scores respectively,
using token-level majority voting and stacking methods; and 3)
De-identification: removing PII from the hospital discharge summaries. Our
results showed that the ensemble model combined using the stacking Support
Vector Machine method on the three base-models with the best F1 scores achieved
excellent results with a F1 score of 99.16% on the test set of our corpus. We
also evaluated the robustness of our modelling component on the 2014 i2b2
de-identification dataset. Our ensemble model, which uses the token-level
majority voting method on all six base-models, achieved the highest F1 score of
96.24% at strict entity matching and the highest F1 score of 98.64% at binary
token-level matching compared to two state-of-the-art methods. The end-to-end
framework provides a robust solution to de-identifying clinical narrative
corpuses safely.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer is a powerful model for text understanding. However, it is
inefficient due to its quadratic complexity to input sequence length. Although
there are many methods on Transformer acceleration, they are still either
inefficient on long sequences or not effective enough. In this paper, we
propose Fastformer, which is an efficient Transformer model based on additive
attention. In Fastformer, instead of modeling the pair-wise interactions
between tokens, we first use additive attention mechanism to model global
contexts, and then further transform each token representation based on its
interaction with global context representations. In this way, Fastformer can
achieve effective context modeling with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments on five datasets show that Fastformer is much more efficient than
many existing Transformer models and can meanwhile achieve comparable or even
better long text modeling performance.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge Graph (KG) alignment aims at finding equivalent entities and
relations (i.e., mappings) between two KGs. The existing approaches utilize
either reasoning-based or semantic embedding-based techniques, but few studies
explore their combination. In this demonstration, we present PRASEMap, an
unsupervised KG alignment system that iteratively computes the Mappings with
both Probabilistic Reasoning (PR) And Semantic Embedding (SE) techniques.
PRASEMap can support various embedding-based KG alignment approaches as the SE
module, and enables easy human computer interaction that additionally provides
an option for users to feed the mapping annotations back to the system for
better results. The demonstration showcases these features via a stand-alone
Web application with user friendly interfaces. The demo is available at

                                        <span>Structured information is an important knowledge source for automatic
verification of factual claims. Nevertheless, the majority of existing research
into this task has focused on textual data, and the few recent inquiries into
structured data have been for the closed-domain setting where appropriate
evidence for each claim is assumed to have already been retrieved. In this
paper, we investigate verification over structured data in the open-domain
setting, introducing a joint reranking-and-verification model which fuses
evidence documents in the verification component. Our open-domain model
achieves performance comparable to the closed-domain state-of-the-art on the
TabFact dataset, and demonstrates performance gains from the inclusion of
multiple tables as well as a significant improvement over a heuristic retrieval
baseline.</span>

                                        <span>With the development of deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP)
makes it possible for us to analyze and understand a large amount of language
texts. Accordingly, we can achieve a semantic communication in terms of joint
semantic source and channel coding over a noisy channel with the help of NLP.
However, the existing method to realize this goal is to use a fixed transformer
of NLP while ignoring the difference of semantic information contained in each
sentence. To solve this problem, we propose a new semantic communication system
based on Universal Transformer. Compared with the traditional transformer, an
adaptive circulation mechanism is introduced in the Universal Transformer.
Through the introduction of the circulation mechanism, the new semantic
communication system can be more flexible to transmit sentences with different
semantic information, and achieve better end-to-end performance under various
channel conditions.</span>

largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. The language belongs to the globe-spanning
language tree, Indo-European. However, due to poverty in both linguistic and
economic capital, Sinhala, in the perspective of Natural Language Processing
tools and research, remains a resource-poor language which has neither the
economic drive its cousin English has nor the sheer push of the law of numbers
a language such as Chinese has. A number of research groups from Sri Lanka have
noticed this dearth and the resultant dire need for proper tools and research
for Sinhala natural language processing. However, due to various reasons, these
attempts seem to lack coordination and awareness of each other. The objective
of this paper is to fill that gap of a comprehensive literature survey of the
publicly available Sinhala natural language tools and research so that the
researchers working in this field can better utilize contributions of their
peers. As such, we shall be uploading this paper to arXiv and perpetually

several reasons, for instance, to enable an understanding of provenance and
methods involved in data handling. However, software is usually not formally
cited, but rather mentioned informally within the scholarly description of the
investigation, raising the need for automatic information extraction and
disambiguation. Given the lack of reliable ground truth data, we present
SoMeSci (Software Mentions in Science) a gold standard knowledge graph of
software mentions in scientific articles. It contains high quality annotations
(IRR: $\kappa{&#x3D;}.82$) of 3756 software mentions in 1367 PubMed Central
articles. Besides the plain mention of the software, we also provide relation
labels for additional information, such as the version, the developer, a URL or
citations. Moreover, we distinguish between different types, such as
application, plugin or programming environment, as well as different types of
mentions, such as usage or creation. To the best of our knowledge, SoMeSci is
the most comprehensive corpus about software mentions in scientific articles,

                                        <span>Providing timely accessibility reminders of a point-of-interest (POI) plays a
vital role in improving user satisfaction of finding places and making visiting
decisions. However, it is difficult to keep the POI database in sync with the
real-world counterparts due to the dynamic nature of business changes. To
alleviate this problem, we formulate and present a practical solution that
jointly extracts POI mentions and identifies their coupled accessibility labels
from unstructured text. We approach this task as a sequence tagging problem,
where the goal is to produce  pairs from
unstructured text. This task is challenging because of two main issues: (1) POI
names are often newly-coined words so as to successfully register new entities
or brands and (2) there may exist multiple pairs in the text, which
necessitates dealing with one-to-many or many-to-one mapping to make each POI
coupled with its accessibility label. To this end, we propose a
Geographic-Enhanced and Dependency-guIded sequence Tagging (GEDIT) model to
concurrently address the two challenges. First, to alleviate challenge #1, we
develop a geographic-enhanced pre-trained model to learn the text
representations. Second, to mitigate challenge #2, we apply a relational graph
convolutional network to learn the tree node representations from the parsed
dependency tree. Finally, we construct a neural sequence tagging model by
integrating and feeding the previously pre-learned representations into a CRF
layer. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of GEDIT. In addition, it has already been
deployed in production at Baidu Maps. Statistics show that the proposed
solution can save significant human effort and labor costs to deal with the
same amount of documents, which confirms that it is a practical way for POI
accessibility maintenance.</span>

sentence containing both entities or a fact in a Knowledge Graph (KG). However,
these instances may not well capture the general relations between entities,
may be difficult to understand by humans, even may not be found due to the
incompleteness of the knowledge source.

In this paper, we introduce the Open Relation Modeling task - given two
entities, generate a coherent sentence describing the relation between them. To
solve this task, we propose to teach machines to generate definition-like
relation descriptions by letting them learn from definitions of entities.
Specifically, we fine-tune Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce
definitions conditioned on extracted entity pairs. To help PLMs reason between
entities and provide additional relational knowledge to PLMs for open relation
modeling, we incorporate reasoning paths in KGs and include a reasoning path
selection mechanism. We show that PLMs can select interpretable and informative
reasoning paths by confidence estimation, and the selected path can guide PLMs
to generate better relation descriptions. Experimental results show that our
model can generate concise but informative relation descriptions that capture
the representative characteristics of entities and relations.</span>

                                        <span>Singing Voice Detection (SVD) has been an active area of research in music
information retrieval (MIR). Currently, two deep neural network-based methods,
one based on CNN and the other on RNN, exist in literature that learn optimized
features for the voice detection (VD) task and achieve state-of-the-art
performance on common datasets. Both these models have a huge number of
parameters (1.4M for CNN and 65.7K for RNN) and hence not suitable for
deployment on devices like smartphones or embedded sensors with limited
capacity in terms of memory and computation power. The most popular method to
address this issue is known as knowledge distillation in deep learning
literature (in addition to model compression) where a large pre-trained network
known as the teacher is used to train a smaller student network. Given the wide
applications of SVD in music information retrieval, to the best of our
knowledge, model compression for practical deployment has not yet been
explored. In this paper, efforts have been made to investigate this issue using
both conventional as well as ensemble knowledge distillation techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Medical imaging is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of numerous
medical problems, including many forms of cancer. Medical imaging reports
distill the findings and observations of radiologists, creating an unstructured
textual representation of unstructured medical images. Large-scale use of this
text-encoded information requires converting the unstructured text to a
structured, semantic representation. We explore the extraction and
normalization of anatomical information in radiology reports that is associated
with radiological findings. We investigate this extraction and normalization
task using a span-based relation extraction model that jointly extracts
entities and relations using BERT. This work examines the factors that
influence extraction and normalization performance, including the body
part/organ system, frequency of occurrence, span length, and span diversity. It
discusses approaches for improving performance and creating high-quality
semantic representations of radiological phenomena.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer has achieved great success in NLP. However, the quadratic
complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer makes it inefficient
in handling long sequences. Many existing works explore to accelerate
Transformers by computing sparse self-attention instead of a dense one, which
usually attends to tokens at certain positions or randomly selected tokens.
However, manually selected or random tokens may be uninformative for context
modeling. In this paper, we propose Smart Bird, which is an efficient and
effective Transformer with learnable sparse attention. In Smart Bird, we first
compute a sketched attention matrix with a single-head low-dimensional
Transformer, which aims to find potential important interactions between
tokens. We then sample token pairs based on their probability scores derived
from the sketched attention matrix to generate different sparse attention index
matrices for different attention heads. Finally, we select token embeddings
according to the index matrices to form the input of sparse attention networks.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets for different tasks validate
the efficiency and effectiveness of Smart Bird in text modeling.</span>

                                        <span>Describing images using natural language is widely known as image captioning,
which has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision
and natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning
models achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and
SPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other
similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few
pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,
which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between
objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same
album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the
distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning
Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar
group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a
group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that
are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other
images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,
resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in
the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and
GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate
(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results
indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of
several baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both
accuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the
quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric
DisWordRate.</span>

tasks. While T5 achieves impressive performance on language tasks cast as
sequence-to-sequence mapping problems, it is unclear how to produce sentence
embeddings from encoder-decoder models. We investigate three methods for
extracting T5 sentence embeddings: two utilize only the T5 encoder and one uses
the full T5 encoder-decoder model. Our encoder-only models outperforms
BERT-based sentence embeddings on both transfer tasks and semantic textual

STS. Scaling up T5 from millions to billions of parameters is found to produce
consistent improvements on downstream tasks. Finally, we introduce a two-stage

                                        <span>Recently, the performance of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) has been
significantly improved by injecting knowledge facts to enhance their abilities
of language understanding. For medical domains, the background knowledge
sources are especially useful, due to the massive medical terms and their
complicated relations are difficult to understand in text. In this work, we
introduce SMedBERT, a medical PLM trained on large-scale medical corpora,
incorporating deep structured semantic knowledge from neighbors of
linked-entity.In SMedBERT, the mention-neighbor hybrid attention is proposed to
learn heterogeneous-entity information, which infuses the semantic
representations of entity types into the homogeneous neighboring entity
structure. Apart from knowledge integration as external features, we propose to
employ the neighbors of linked-entities in the knowledge graph as additional
global contexts of text mentions, allowing them to communicate via shared
neighbors, thus enrich their semantic representations. Experiments demonstrate
that SMedBERT significantly outperforms strong baselines in various
knowledge-intensive Chinese medical tasks. It also improves the performance of
other tasks such as question answering, question matching and natural language
inference.</span>

in images. It differentiates from the original VQA task as Text-VQA requires
large amounts of scene-text relationship understanding, in addition to the
cross-modal grounding capability. In this paper, we propose Localize, Group,

key information of the image, utilizes scene text clustering to group
individual OCR tokens, and learns to select the best answer from different

                                        <span>Multi-modal generation has been widely explored in recent years. Current
research directions involve generating text based on an image or vice versa. In
this paper, we propose a new task called CIGLI: Conditional Image Generation
from Language and Image. Instead of generating an image based on text as in
text-image generation, this task requires the generation of an image from a
textual description and an image prompt. We designed a new dataset to ensure
that the text description describes information from both images, and that
solely analyzing the description is insufficient to generate an image. We then
propose a novel language-image fusion model which improves the performance over
two established baseline methods, as evaluated by quantitative (automatic) and
qualitative (human) evaluations. The code and dataset is available at
https://github.com/vincentlux/CIGLI.</span>

navigate in realistic environments using natural language instructions. Given
the scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image
and language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments
remains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve
generalization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing
small-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements.
In this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN
dataset. We first collect image-caption (IC) pairs from hundreds of thousands
of listings from online rental marketplaces. Using IC pairs we next propose
automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs.
We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal
order inside PI pairs. We use BnB pretrain our Airbert model that can be
adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms
state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring
Expression (REVERIE) benchmarks. Moreover, our in-domain pretraining
significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation,
where we train the model only on VLN instructions from a few houses.</span>

                                        <span>Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) aims to extract answers to questions
given a passage. It has been widely studied recently, especially in open
domains. However, few efforts have been made on closed-domain MRC, mainly due
to the lack of large-scale training data. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-target MRC task for the medical domain, whose goal is to predict answers
to medical questions and the corresponding support sentences from medical
information sources simultaneously, in order to ensure the high reliability of
medical knowledge serving. A high-quality dataset is manually constructed for
the purpose, named Multi-task Chinese Medical MRC dataset (CMedMRC), with
detailed analysis conducted. We further propose the Chinese medical BERT model
for the task (CMedBERT), which fuses medical knowledge into pre-trained
language models by the dynamic fusion mechanism of heterogeneous features and
the multi-task learning strategy. Experiments show that CMedBERT consistently
outperforms strong baselines by fusing context-aware and knowledge-aware token
representations.</span>

task learning to the Contrastive learning. But contrastive methods have some
drawbacks which could not be solved completely, such as performing poor on
fine-grained visual tasks compare to supervised learning methods. In this
study, at first, the impact of ImageNet pre-training on fine-grained Facial
Expression Recognition (FER) was tested. It could be seen from the results that
training from scratch is better than ImageNet fine-tuning at stronger
augmentation levels. After that, a framework was proposed for standard
Supervised Learning (SL), called Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) which merged
Self-Supervised as auxiliary task to the SL training setting. Leveraging
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) can gain additional information from input data
than labels which can help the main fine-grained SL task. It is been
investigated how this method could be used for FER by designing two customized
version of common pre-text techniques, Jigsaw puzzling and in-painting. The
state-of-the-art was reached on AffectNet via two types of HMTL, without
utilizing pre-training on additional datasets. Moreover, we showed the
difference between SS pre-training and HMTL to demonstrate superiority of
proposed method. Furthermore, the impact of proposed method was shown on two
other fine-grained facial tasks, Head Poses estimation and Gender Recognition,
which concluded to reduce in error rate by 11% and 1% respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Facial expressions are the most common universal forms of body language. In
the past few years, automatic facial expression recognition (FER) has been an
active field of research. However, it is still a challenging task due to
different uncertainties and complications. Nevertheless, efficiency and
performance are yet essential aspects for building robust systems. We proposed
two models, EmoXNet which is an ensemble learning technique for learning
convoluted facial representations, and EmoXNetLite which is a distillation
technique that is useful for transferring the knowledge from our ensemble model
to an efficient deep neural network using label-smoothen soft labels for able
to effectively detect expressions in real-time. Both of the techniques
performed quite well, where the ensemble model (EmoXNet) helped to achieve
85.07% test accuracy on FER2013 with FER+ annotations and 86.25% test accuracy
on RAF-DB. Moreover, the distilled model (EmoXNetLite) showed 82.07% test
accuracy on FER2013 with FER+ annotations and 81.78% test accuracy on RAF-DB.
Results show that our models seem to generalize well on new data and are
learned to focus on relevant facial representations for expressions
recognition.</span>

detectors when the training and test data follow different distributions,
previous work has mostly focused on two-stage detectors. This is because their
use of region proposals makes it possible to perform local adaptation, which
has been shown to significantly improve the adaptation effectiveness. Here, by
contrast, we target single-stage architectures, which are better suited to
resource-constrained detection than two-stage ones but do not provide region
proposals. To nonetheless benefit from the strength of local adaptation, we
introduce an attention mechanism that lets us identify the important regions on
which adaptation should focus. Our method gradually adapts the features from
global, image-level to local, instance-level. Our approach is generic and can
be integrated into any single-stage detector. We demonstrate this on standard
benchmark datasets by applying it to both SSD and YOLOv5. Furthermore, for
equivalent single-stage architectures, our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques even though they were designed

object interaction can be formulated as a composite (structured) set detection
problem in which both the parts (subject, object, and predicate) and the sum
(triplet as a whole) are to be detected in a hierarchical fashion. In this
paper, we present a new approach, denoted Part-and-Sum detection Transformer
(PST), to perform end-to-end visual composite set detection. Different from
existing Transformers in which queries are at a single level, we simultaneously
model the joint part and sum hypotheses/interactions with composite queries and
attention modules. We explicitly incorporate sum queries to enable better
modeling of the part-and-sum relations that are absent in the standard
Transformers. Our approach also uses novel tensor-based part queries and
vector-based sum queries, and models their joint interaction. We report
experiments on two vision tasks, visual relationship detection and human object
interaction and demonstrate that PST achieves state of the art results among
single-stage models, while nearly matching the results of custom designed

detection as an end-to-end optimization problem. To address this problem, we
propose ImVoxelNet, a novel fully convolutional method of 3D object detection
based on monocular or multi-view RGB images. The number of monocular images in
each multi-view input can variate during training and inference; actually, this
number might be unique for each multi-view input. ImVoxelNet successfully
handles both indoor and outdoor scenes, which makes it general-purpose.
Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art results in car detection on KITTI
(monocular) and nuScenes (multi-view) benchmarks among all methods that accept
RGB images. Moreover, it surpasses existing RGB-based 3D object detection
methods on the SUN RGB-D dataset. On ScanNet, ImVoxelNet sets a new benchmark
for multi-view 3D object detection. The source code and the trained models are

                                        <span>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are frequently used for
tasks involving time-sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is
difficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and
low latency because the fully connected structure makes LSTM networks a
memory-bounded algorithm. Previous LSTM accelerators either exploited weight
spatial sparsity or temporal activation sparsity. This paper proposes a new
accelerator called &quot;Spartus&quot; that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve
ultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity is induced using our proposed
pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD), which structures
sparse weight matrices for balanced workload. It achieved up to 96% weight
sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an LSTM network trained on a
TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal sparsity in LSTM, we create
the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU method to the LSTM network.
This combined sparsity simultaneously saves on the weight memory access and
associated arithmetic operations. Spartus was implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100
FPGA. The Spartus per-sample latency for a single DeltaLSTM layer of 1024
neurons averages 1 us. Spartus achieved 9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput
and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which, respectively, are 4X and 7X higher than
the previous state-of-the-art.</span>

barriers and impede the mobility of people with low vision or blindness, for
instance, a path detected behind a glass door is inaccessible unless it is
correctly perceived and reacted. However, segmenting these safety-critical
objects is rarely covered by conventional assistive technologies. To tackle
this issue, we construct a wearable system with a novel dual-head Transformer
for Transparency (Trans4Trans) model, which is capable of segmenting general

walking alone more safely. Especially, both decoders created by our proposed
Transformer Parsing Module (TPM) enable effective joint learning from different
datasets. Besides, the efficient Trans4Trans model composed of symmetric
transformer-based encoder and decoder, requires little computational expenses
and is readily deployed on portable GPUs. Our Trans4Trans model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the test sets of Stanford2D3D and Trans10K-v2

learning. A common paradigm in contrastive learning is to construct positive
pairs by sampling different data views for the same instance, with different
data instances as negatives. These methods implicitly assume a set of
representational invariances to the view selection mechanism (eg, sampling
frames with temporal shifts), which may lead to poor performance on downstream
tasks which violate these invariances (fine-grained video action recognition
that would benefit from temporal information). To overcome this limitation, we
propose an &#x27;augmentation aware&#x27; contrastive learning framework, where we
explicitly provide a sequence of augmentation parameterisations (such as the
values of the time shifts used to create data views) as composable augmentation
encodings (CATE) to our model when projecting the video representations for
contrastive learning. We show that representations learned by our method encode
valuable information about specified spatial or temporal augmentation, and in

                                        <span>Frame sampling is a fundamental problem in video action recognition due to
the essential redundancy in time and limited computation resources. The
existing sampling strategy often employs a fixed frame selection and lacks the
flexibility to deal with complex variations in videos. In this paper, we
present a simple, sparse, and explainable frame sampler, termed as
Motion-Guided Sampler (MGSampler). Our basic motivation is that motion is an
important and universal signal that can drive us to adaptively select frames
from videos. Accordingly, we propose two important properties in our MGSampler
design: motion sensitive and motion uniform. First, we present two different
motion representations to enable us to efficiently distinguish the
motion-salient frames from the background. Then, we devise a motion-uniform
sampling strategy based on the cumulative motion distribution to ensure the
sampled frames evenly cover all the important segments with high motion
salience. Our MGSampler yields a new principled and holistic sampling scheme,
that could be incorporated into any existing video architecture. Experiments on
five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our MGSampler over the
previous fixed sampling strategies, and its generalization power across
different backbones, video models, and datasets.</span>

domain, unsupervised many-to-many image-to-image (UMMI2I) translation methods
seek to generate a plausible example from the target domain that preserves
domain-invariant information of the input source image and inherits the
domain-specific information from the guidance image. For example, when
translating female faces to male faces, the generated male face should have the
same expression, pose and hair color as the input female image, and the same
facial hairstyle and other male-specific attributes as the guidance male image.
Current state-of-the art UMMI2I methods generate visually pleasing images, but,
since for most pairs of real datasets we do not know which attributes are
domain-specific and which are domain-invariant, the semantic correctness of
existing approaches has not been quantitatively evaluated yet. In this paper,
we propose a set of benchmarks and metrics for the evaluation of semantic
correctness of these methods. We provide an extensive study of existing
state-of-the-art UMMI2I translation methods, showing that all methods, to
different degrees, fail to infer which attributes are domain-specific and which
are domain-invariant from data, and mostly rely on inductive biases hard-coded
into their architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Measuring similarity between two images often requires performing complex
reasoning along different axes (e.g., color, texture, or shape). Insights into
what might be important for measuring similarity can can be provided by
annotated attributes, but prior work tends to view these annotations as
complete, resulting in them using a simplistic approach of predicting
attributes on single images, which are, in turn, used to measure similarity.
However, it is impractical for a dataset to fully annotate every attribute that
may be important. Thus, only representing images based on these incomplete
annotations may miss out on key information. To address this issue, we propose
the Pairwise Attribute-informed similarity Network (PAN), which breaks
similarity learning into capturing similarity conditions and relevance scores
from a joint representation of two images. This enables our model to identify
that two images contain the same attribute, but can have it deemed irrelevant
(e.g., due to fine-grained differences between them) and ignored for measuring
similarity between the two images. Notably, while prior methods of using
attribute annotations are often unable to outperform prior art, PAN obtains a
4-9% improvement on compatibility prediction between clothing items on Polyvore
Outfits, a 5% gain on few shot classification of images using Caltech-UCSD
Birds (CUB), and over 1% boost to Recall@1 on In-Shop Clothes Retrieval.

                                        <span>Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted much attention with the
prevalence of accessible depth sensors. Recently, graph convolutional networks
(GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to
model graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for
modeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly
focus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is
learned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer
of the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple
sets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The
reason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and
conventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights
into GCNs. To overcome this gap, we reinvent the split-transform-merge strategy
in GCNs for skeleton sequence processing. Specifically, we design a simple and
highly modularized graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based
action recognition. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block
that aggregates multi-granularity information from both the spatial and
temporal paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin with only 1/5 of the
parameters and 1/10 of the FLOPs. Code is available at

                                        <span>Existing calibration algorithms address the problem of covariate shift via
unsupervised domain adaptation. However, these methods suffer from the
following limitations: 1) they require unlabeled data from the target domain,
which may not be available at the stage of calibration in real-world
applications and 2) their performance depends heavily on the disparity between
the distributions of the source and target domains. To address these two
limitations, we present novel calibration solutions via domain generalization.
Our core idea is to leverage multiple calibration domains to reduce the
effective distribution disparity between the target and calibration domains for
improved calibration transfer without needing any data from the target domain.
We provide theoretical justification and empirical experimental results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Compared against
state-of-the-art calibration methods designed for domain adaptation, we observe
a decrease of 8.86 percentage points in expected calibration error or,
equivalently, an increase of 35 percentage points in improvement ratio for
multi-class classification on the Office-Home dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Floods wreak havoc throughout the world, causing billions of dollars in
damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, generating pseudo labels or low confidence
labels on the entire unlabeled test dataset, and then, (2) filter out quality
generated labels and, (3) combining the generated labels with the previously
available high confidence labeled dataset. This assimilated dataset is used for
the next round of training ensemble models. This cyclical process is repeated
until the performance improvement plateaus. Additionally, we post process our
results with Conditional Random Fields. Our approach sets the second highest
score on the public hold-out test leaderboard for the ETCI competition with
0.7654 IoU. To the best of our knowledge we believe this is one of the first
works to try out semi-supervised learning to improve flood segmentation models.</span>

                                        <span>Predicting accurate future trajectories of multiple agents is essential for
autonomous systems, but is challenging due to the complex agent interaction and
the uncertainty in each agent&#x27;s future behavior. Forecasting multi-agent
trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we
model the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social
dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most
prior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., first using a
temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and
then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model.
This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the
time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would
prefer a method that allows an agent&#x27;s state at one time to directly affect
another agent&#x27;s state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new
Transformer, AgentFormer, that jointly models the time and social dimensions.
The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by
flattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention
operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence,
AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent
identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements
of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent
trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any
previous timestep when inferring an agent&#x27;s future position. The latent intent
of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one
agent&#x27;s behavior to affect other agents. Our method significantly improves the
state of the art on well-established pedestrian and autonomous driving
datasets.</span>

2020 (DF20). The dataset, constructed from observations submitted to the Atlas
of Danish Fungi, is unique in its taxonomy-accurate class labels, small number
of errors, highly unbalanced long-tailed class distribution, rich observation
metadata, and well-defined class hierarchy. DF20 has zero overlap with
ImageNet, allowing unbiased comparison of models fine-tuned from publicly
available ImageNet checkpoints. The proposed evaluation protocol enables
testing the ability to improve classification using metadata -- e.g. precise
geographic location, habitat, and substrate, facilitates classifier calibration
testing, and finally allows to study the impact of the device settings on the
classification performance. Experiments using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) and the recent Vision Transformers (ViT) show that DF20 presents a
challenging task. Interestingly, ViT achieves results superior to CNN baselines
with 80.45% accuracy and 0.743 macro F1 score, reducing the CNN error by 9% and
12% respectively. A simple procedure for including metadata into the decision
process improves the classification accuracy by more than 2.95 percentage
points, reducing the error rate by 15%. The source code for all methods and

                                        <span>Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) helps physicians examine the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract noninvasively. There are few studies that address
pathological assessment of endoscopy images in multiclass classification and
most of them are based on binary anomaly detection or aim to detect a specific
type of anomaly. Multiclass anomaly detection is challenging, especially when
the dataset is poorly sampled or imbalanced. Many available datasets in
endoscopy field, such as KID2, suffer from an imbalance issue, which makes it
difficult to train a high-performance model. Additionally, increasing the
number of classes makes classification more difficult. We proposed a multiclass
classification algorithm that is extensible to any number of classes and can
handle an imbalance issue. The proposed method uses multiple autoencoders where
each one is trained on one class to extract features with the most
discrimination from other classes. The loss function of autoencoders is set
based on reconstruction, compactness, distance from other classes, and
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The extracted features are clustered and then
classified using an ensemble of support vector data descriptors. A total of
1,778 normal, 227 inflammation, 303 vascular, and 44 polyp images from the KID2
dataset are used for evaluation. The entire algorithm ran 5 times and achieved
F1-score of 96.3 +- 0.2% and 85.0 +- 0.4% on the test set for binary and
multiclass anomaly detection, respectively. The impact of each step of the
algorithm was investigated by various ablation studies and the results were
compared with published works. The suggested approach is a competitive option
for detecting multiclass anomalies in the GI field.</span>

representation alteration (TARA) for the mitigation of prominent causes of AI
bias by including: a) the use of representation learning alteration via
adversarial independence to suppress the bias-inducing dependence of the data
representation from protected factors; and b) training set alteration via
intelligent augmentation to address bias-causing data imbalance, by using
generative models that allow the fine control of sensitive factors related to
underrepresented populations via domain adaptation and latent space

demonstrate that TARA significantly or fully debiases baseline models while

                                        <span>Scene graph generation aims to identify objects and their relations in
images, providing structured image representations that can facilitate numerous
applications in computer vision. However, scene graph models usually require
supervised learning on large quantities of labeled data with intensive human
annotation. In this work, we propose visual distant supervision, a novel
paradigm of visual relation learning, which can train scene graph models
without any human-labeled data. The intuition is that by aligning commonsense
knowledge bases and images, we can automatically create large-scale labeled
data to provide distant supervision for visual relation learning. To alleviate
the noise in distantly labeled data, we further propose a framework that
iteratively estimates the probabilistic relation labels and eliminates the
noisy ones. Comprehensive experimental results show that our distantly
supervised model outperforms strong weakly supervised and semi-supervised
baselines. By further incorporating human-labeled data in a semi-supervised
fashion, our model outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models by a
large margin (e.g., 8.3 micro- and 7.8 macro-recall@50 improvements for
predicate classification in Visual Genome evaluation). We make the data and

                                        <span>Recent work has shown that the performance of machine learning models can
vary substantially when models are evaluated on data drawn from a distribution
that is close to but different from the training distribution. As a result,
predicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge.
Our work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty
literature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen
distributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution
shift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve
their performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms
of predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through
investigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as
Frechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to
induce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other
hand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier&#x27;s
predictions successfully estimates the classifier&#x27;s performance change over a
variety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between
synthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its
simplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional
difference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\%$) on several
realistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust
and ImageNet-Rendition datasets.</span>

views with unknown camera poses. While prior approaches have successfully
created object-centric reconstructions of many scenes, they fail to exploit
other structures, such as planes, which are typically the dominant components
of indoor scenes. In this paper, we reconstruct planar surfaces from multiple

                                        <span>We propose a novel framework to learn the spatiotemporal variability in
longitudinal 3D shape data sets, which contain observations of objects that
evolve and deform over time. This problem is challenging since surfaces come
with arbitrary parameterizations and thus, they need to be spatially
registered. Also, different deforming objects, also called 4D surfaces, evolve
at different speeds and thus they need to be temporally aligned. We solve this
spatiotemporal registration problem using a Riemannian approach. We treat a 3D
surface as a point in a shape space equipped with an elastic Riemannian metric
that measures the amount of bending and stretching that the surfaces undergo. A
4D surface can then be seen as a trajectory in this space. With this
formulation, the statistical analysis of 4D surfaces can be cast as the problem
of analyzing trajectories embedded in a nonlinear Riemannian manifold. However,
performing the spatiotemporal registration, and subsequently computing
statistics, on such nonlinear spaces is not straightforward as they rely on
complex nonlinear optimizations. Our core contribution is the mapping of the
surfaces to the space of Square-Root Normal Fields where the L2 metric is
equivalent to the partial elastic metric in the space of surfaces. Thus, by
solving the spatial registration in the SRNF space, the problem of analyzing 4D
surfaces becomes the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in the SRNF
space, which has a Euclidean structure. In this paper, we develop the building
blocks that enable such analysis. These include: (1) the spatiotemporal
registration of arbitrarily parameterized 4D surfaces in the presence of large
elastic deformations and large variations in their execution rates; (2) the
computation of geodesics between 4D surfaces; (3) the computation of
statistical summaries; and (4) the synthesis of random 4D surfaces.</span>

(CMB) surveys will create opportunities for characteristically new insights
into cosmology. Secondary anisotropies of the CMB will have an increased
importance in forthcoming surveys, due both to the cosmological information
they encode and the role they play in obscuring our view of the primary
fluctuations. Quadratic estimators have become the standard tools for
reconstructing the fields that distort the primary CMB and produce secondary
anisotropies. While successful for lensing reconstruction with current data,
quadratic estimators will be sub-optimal for the reconstruction of lensing and
other effects at the expected sensitivity of the upcoming CMB surveys. In this
paper we describe a convolutional neural network, ResUNet-CMB, that is capable
of the simultaneous reconstruction of two sources of secondary CMB
anisotropies, gravitational lensing and patchy reionization. We show that the
ResUNet-CMB network significantly outperforms the quadratic estimator at low
noise levels and is not subject to the lensing-induced bias on the patchy
reionization reconstruction that would be present with a straightforward
application of the quadratic estimator.</span>

trained iteratively with the annotations generated by the proposed method, and
we perform object detection on each frame independently. We employ Multiple
Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) to exploit temporal information and to reduce the
number of false-positives which makes it possible to use lower objectness
thresholds for detection to increase recall. The tracklets formed by MHT are
evaluated by human operators to enlarge the training set. This novel

                                        <span>3D human pose estimation is frequently seen as the task of estimating 3D
poses relative to the root body joint. Alternatively, we propose a 3D human
pose estimation method in camera coordinates, which allows effective
combination of 2D annotated data and 3D poses and a straightforward multi-view
generalization. To that end, we cast the problem as a view frustum space pose
estimation, where absolute depth prediction and joint relative depth
estimations are disentangled. Final 3D predictions are obtained in camera
coordinates by the inverse camera projection. Based on this, we also present a
consensus-based optimization algorithm for multi-view predictions from
uncalibrated images, which requires a single monocular training procedure.
Although our method is indirectly tied to the training camera intrinsics, it
still converges for cameras with different intrinsic parameters, resulting in
coherent estimations up to a scale factor. Our method improves the state of the
art on well known 3D human pose datasets, reducing the prediction error by 32%
in the most common benchmark. We also reported our results in absolute pose
position error, achieving 80~mm for monocular estimations and 51~mm for
multi-view, on average.</span>

tools for diagnosing gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders. Detecting the
anatomical location of GI tract can help clinicians to determine a more
appropriate treatment plan, can reduce repetitive endoscopy and is important in
drug-delivery. There are few research that address detecting anatomical
location of WCE and CE images using classification, mainly because of
difficulty in collecting data and anotating them. In this study, we present a
few-shot learning method based on distance metric learning which combines
transfer-learning and manifold mixup scheme for localizing endoscopy frames and
can be trained on few samples. The manifold mixup process improves few-shot
learning by increasing the number of training epochs while reducing
overfitting, as well as providing more accurate decision boundaries. A dataset
is collected from 10 different anatomical positions of human GI tract. Two
models were trained using only 78 CE and 27 WCE annotated frames to predict the
location of 25700 and 1825 video frames from CE and WCE, respectively. In
addition, we performed subjective evaluation using nine gastroenterologists to
show the necessaity of having an AI system for localization. Various ablation
studies and interpretations are performed to show the importance of each step,
such effect of transfer-learning approach, and impact of manifold mixup on
performance. The proposed method is also compared with various methods trained
on categorical cross-entropy loss and produced better results which show that
proposed method has potential to be used for endoscopy image classification.</span>

vulnerable to a variety of privacy attacks, including membership inference
attacks, that lead to violations of regulations governing the use of medical
data and threaten to compromise their effective deployment in the clinic. In
contrast to most recent work in privacy-aware ML that has been focused on model
alteration and post-processing steps, we propose here a novel and complementary
scheme that enhances the security of medical data by controlling the data
sharing process. We develop and evaluate a privacy defense protocol based on
using a generative adversarial network (GAN) that allows a medical data sourcer
(e.g. a hospital) to provide an external agent (a modeler) a proxy dataset
synthesized from the original images, so that the resulting diagnostic systems
made available to model consumers is rendered resilient to privacy attackers.
We validate the proposed method on retinal diagnostics AI used for diabetic
retinopathy that bears the risk of possibly leaking private information. To
incorporate concerns of both privacy advocates and modelers, we introduce a
metric to evaluate privacy and utility performance in combination, and
demonstrate, using these novel and classical metrics, that our approach, by
itself or in conjunction with other defenses, provides state of the art (SOTA)
performance for defending against privacy attacks.</span>

                                        <span>Every recent image-to-image translation model inherently requires either
image-level (i.e. input-output pairs) or set-level (i.e. domain labels)
supervision. However, even set-level supervision can be a severe bottleneck for
data collection in practice. In this paper, we tackle image-to-image
translation in a fully unsupervised setting, i.e., neither paired images nor
domain labels. To this end, we propose a truly unsupervised image-to-image
translation model (TUNIT) that simultaneously learns to separate image domains
and translates input images into the estimated domains. Experimental results
show that our model achieves comparable or even better performance than the
set-level supervised model trained with full labels, generalizes well on
various datasets, and is robust against the choice of hyperparameters (e.g. the
preset number of pseudo domains). Furthermore, TUNIT can be easily extended to
semi-supervised learning with a few labeled data.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-label zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a more realistic counter-part of
standard single-label ZSL since several objects can co-exist in a natural
image. However, the occurrence of multiple objects complicates the reasoning
and requires region-specific processing of visual features to preserve their
contextual cues. We note that the best existing multi-label ZSL method takes a
shared approach towards attending to region features with a common set of
attention maps for all the classes. Such shared maps lead to diffused
attention, which does not discriminatively focus on relevant locations when the
number of classes are large. Moreover, mapping spatially-pooled visual features
to the class semantics leads to inter-class feature entanglement, thus
hampering the classification. Here, we propose an alternate approach towards
region-based discriminability-preserving multi-label zero-shot classification.
Our approach maintains the spatial resolution to preserve region-level
characteristics and utilizes a bi-level attention module (BiAM) to enrich the
features by incorporating both region and scene context information. The
enriched region-level features are then mapped to the class semantics and only
their class predictions are spatially pooled to obtain image-level predictions,
thereby keeping the multi-class features disentangled. Our approach sets a new
state of the art on two large-scale multi-label zero-shot benchmarks: NUS-WIDE
and Open Images. On NUS-WIDE, our approach achieves an absolute gain of 6.9%
mAP for ZSL, compared to the best published results.</span>

the operating room that can analyze and support the clinical activities. The
lack of annotated data and the complexity of state-of-the-art pose estimation
approaches limit, however, the deployment of such techniques inside the OR. In
this work, we propose to use knowledge distillation in a teacher/student
framework to harness the knowledge present in a large-scale non-annotated
dataset and in an accurate but complex multi-stage teacher network to train a
lightweight network for joint 2D/3D pose estimation. The teacher network also
exploits the unlabeled data to generate both hard and soft labels useful in
improving the student predictions. The easily deployable network trained using
this effective self-supervision strategy performs on par with the teacher
network on \emph{MVOR+}, an extension of the public MVOR dataset where all
persons have been fully annotated, thus providing a viable solution for

classification of idealized point cloud, however, non-idealized point cloud
classification is still a challenging task. In this paper, DNDFN, namely,
Dual-Neighborhood Deep Fusion Network, is proposed to deal with this problem.
DNDFN has two key points. One is combination of local neighborhood and global
neigh-borhood. nearest neighbor (kNN) or ball query can capture the local
neighborhood but ignores long-distance dependencies. A trainable neighborhood
learning meth-od called TN-Learning is proposed, which can capture the global
neighborhood. TN-Learning is combined with them to obtain richer neighborhood
information. The other is information transfer convolution (IT-Conv) which can
learn the structural information between two points and transfer features
through it. Extensive exper-iments on idealized and non-idealized benchmarks
across four tasks verify DNDFN achieves the state of the arts.</span>

                                        <span>While the depth of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) surpasses that
of the pioneering networks with a significant margin, the traditional way of
appending supervision only over the final classifier and progressively
propagating gradient flow upstream remains the training mainstay. Seminal
Deeply-Supervised Networks (DSN) were proposed to alleviate the difficulty of
optimization arising from gradient flow through a long chain. However, it is
still vulnerable to issues including interference to the hierarchical
representation generation process and inconsistent optimization objectives, as
illustrated theoretically and empirically in this paper. Complementary to
previous training strategies, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Mimicking, a
generic feature learning mechanism, to advance CNN training with enhanced
generalization ability. Partially inspired by DSN, we fork delicately designed
side branches from the intermediate layers of a given neural network. Each
branch can emerge from certain locations of the main branch dynamically, which
not only retains representation rooted in the backbone network but also
generates more diverse representations along its own pathway. We go one step
further to promote multi-level interactions among different branches through an
optimization formula with probabilistic prediction matching losses, thus
guaranteeing a more robust optimization process and better representation
ability. Experiments on both category and instance recognition tasks
demonstrate the substantial improvements of our proposed method over its
corresponding counterparts using diverse state-of-the-art CNN architectures.

                                        <span>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for video denoising are typically
trained with supervision, assuming the availability of clean videos. However,
in many applications, such as microscopy, noiseless videos are not available.
To address this, we propose an Unsupervised Deep Video Denoiser (UDVD), a CNN
architecture designed to be trained exclusively with noisy data. The
performance of UDVD is comparable to the supervised state-of-the-art, even when
trained only on a single short noisy video. We demonstrate the promise of our
approach in real-world imaging applications by denoising raw video,
fluorescence-microscopy and electron-microscopy data. In contrast to many
current approaches to video denoising, UDVD does not require explicit motion
compensation. This is advantageous because motion compensation is
computationally expensive, and can be unreliable when the input data are noisy.
A gradient-based analysis reveals that UDVD automatically adapts to local
motion in the input noisy videos. Thus, the network learns to perform implicit
motion compensation, even though it is only trained for denoising.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art tool
for dealing with unsolved problems in computer vision and image processing.
Since the convolution operator is a linear operator, several generalizations
have been proposed to improve the performance of CNNs. One way to increase the
capability of the convolution operator is by applying activation functions on
the inner product operator. In this paper, we will introduce PowerLinear
activation functions, which are based on the polynomial kernel generalization
of the convolution operator. EvenPowLin functions are the main branch of the
PowerLinear activation functions. This class of activation functions is
saturated neither in the positive input region nor in the negative one. Also,
the negative inputs are activated with the same magnitude as the positive
inputs. These features made the EvenPowLin activation functions able to be
utilized in the first layer of CNN architectures and learn complex features of
input images. Additionally, EvenPowLin activation functions are used in CNN
models to classify the inversion of grayscale images as accurately as the
original grayscale images, which is significantly better than commonly used
activation functions.</span>

                                        <span>The non-uniform surface temperature distribution of rotating active stars is
routinely mapped with the Doppler Imaging technique. Inhomogeneities in the
surface produce features in high-resolution spectroscopic observations that
shift in wavelength depending on their position on the visible hemisphere. The
inversion problem has been systematically solved using maximum a-posteriori
regularized methods assuming smoothness or maximum entropy. Our aim in this
work is to solve the full Bayesian inference problem, by providing access to
the posterior distribution of the surface temperature in the star. We use
amortized neural posterior estimation to produce a model that approximates the
high-dimensional posterior distribution for spectroscopic observations of
selected spectral ranges sampled at arbitrary rotation phases. The posterior
distribution is approximated with conditional normalizing flows, which are
flexible, tractable and easy to sample approximations to arbitrary
distributions. When conditioned on the spectroscopic observations, they provide
a very efficient way of obtaining samples from the posterior distribution. The
conditioning on observations is obtained through the use of Transformer
encoders, which can deal with arbitrary wavelength sampling and rotation
phases. Our model can produce thousands of posterior samples per second. Our
validation of the model for very high signal-to-noise observations shows that
it correctly approximates the posterior, although with some overestimation of
the broadening. We apply the model to the moderately fast rotator II Peg,
producing the first Bayesian map of its temperature inhomogenities. We conclude
that conditional normalizing flows are a very promising tool to carry out
approximate Bayesian inference in more complex problems in stellar physics,
like constraining the magnetic properties.</span>

                                        <span>Explainable artificial intelligence has been gaining attention in the past
few years. However, most existing methods are based on gradients or
intermediate features, which are not directly involved in the decision-making
process of the classifier. In this paper, we propose a slot attention-based
classifier called SCOUTER for transparent yet accurate classification. Two
major differences from other attention-based methods include: (a) SCOUTER&#x27;s
explanation is involved in the final confidence for each category, offering
more intuitive interpretation, and (b) all the categories have their
corresponding positive or negative explanation, which tells &quot;why the image is
of a certain category&quot; or &quot;why the image is not of a certain category.&quot; We
design a new loss tailored for SCOUTER that controls the model&#x27;s behavior to
switch between positive and negative explanations, as well as the size of
explanatory regions. Experimental results show that SCOUTER can give better
visual explanations in terms of various metrics while keeping good accuracy on
small and medium-sized datasets.</span>

In most cases, this data is not fully described by the given set of labels.
Often a rich set of meaningful concepts exist in the domain that can much more
precisely describe each datapoint. Such concepts can also be highly useful for
interpreting the model&#x27;s classifications. In this paper we propose a model,
denoted as Variational Autoencoder-based Contrastive Explanation (VAE-CE), that
represents data with high-level concepts and uses this representation for both
classification and generating explanations. The explanations are produced in a
contrastive manner, conveying why a datapoint is assigned to one class rather
than an alternative class. An explanation is specified as a set of
transformations of the input datapoint, with each step depicting a concept
changing towards the contrastive class. We build the model using a disentangled
VAE, extended with a new supervised method for disentangling individual
dimensions. An analysis on synthetic data and MNIST shows that the approaches
to both disentanglement and explanation provide benefits over other methods.</span>

human pose estimation methods and their applications in the Operating Room
(OR), we release the Multi-View Operating Room (MVOR) dataset, the first public
dataset recorded during real clinical interventions. It consists of 732
synchronized multi-view frames recorded by three RGB-D cameras in a hybrid OR.
It also includes the visual challenges present in such environments, such as
occlusions and clutter. We provide camera calibration parameters, color and
depth frames, human bounding boxes, and 2D/3D pose annotations. In this paper,
we present the dataset, its annotations, as well as baseline results from
several recent person detection and 2D/3D pose estimation methods. Since we
need to blur some parts of the images to hide identity and nudity in the
released dataset, we also present a comparative study of how the baselines have
been impacted by the blurring. Results show a large margin for improvement and
suggest that the MVOR dataset can be useful to compare the performance of the

context-aware systems inside the operating room (OR). The 24/7 use of images
coming from cameras mounted on the OR ceiling can however raise concerns for
privacy, even in the case of depth images captured by RGB-D sensors. Being able
to solely use low-resolution privacy-preserving images would address these
concerns and help scale up the computer-assisted approaches that rely on such
data to a larger number of ORs. In this paper, we introduce the problem of HPE
on low-resolution depth images and propose an end-to-end solution that
integrates a multi-scale super-resolution network with a 2D human pose
estimation network. By exploiting intermediate feature-maps generated at
different super-resolution, our approach achieves body pose results on
low-resolution images (of size 64x48) that are on par with those of an approach

variation in view of inconsistent data acquisition procedure, which thus leads
to domain discrepancy due to diverse and uncontrollable shape representation
cross datasets. To improve discrimination on unseen distribution of point-based
geometries in a practical and feasible perspective, this paper proposes a new
method of geometry-aware self-training (GAST) for unsupervised domain
adaptation of object point cloud classification. Specifically, this paper aims
to learn a domain-shared representation of semantic categories, via two novel
self-supervised geometric learning tasks as feature regularization. On one
hand, the representation learning is empowered by a linear mixup of point cloud
samples with their self-generated rotation labels, to capture a global
topological configuration of local geometries. On the other hand, a diverse
point distribution across datasets can be normalized with a novel
curvature-aware distortion localization. Experiments on the PointDA-10 dataset

reasons: (1) the video scene structure is complex and (2) it includes multiple
modalities (e.g., visual, audio, text.). While previous work focuses mostly on
activity videos (e.g. &quot;cooking&quot;, &quot;sports&quot;), it is not clear how they can be
leveraged to tackle the task of video ads content structuring. In this paper,
we propose a two-stage method that first provides the boundaries of the scenes,
and then combines a confidence score for each segmented scene and the tag
classes predicted for that scene. We provide extensive experimental results on
the network architectures and modalities used for the proposed method. Our
combined method improves the previous baselines on the challenging &quot;Tencent
Advertisement Video&quot; dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Active learning for object detection is conventionally achieved by applying
techniques developed for classification in a way that aggregates individual
detections into image-level selection criteria. This is typically coupled with
the costly assumption that every image selected for labelling must be
exhaustively annotated. This yields incremental improvements on well-curated
vision datasets and struggles in the presence of data imbalance and visual
clutter that occurs in real-world imagery. Alternatives to the image-level
approach are surprisingly under-explored in the literature. In this work, we
introduce a new strategy that subsumes previous Image-level and Object-level
approaches into a generalized, Region-level approach that promotes
spatial-diversity by avoiding nearby redundant queries from the same image and
minimizes context-switching for the labeler. We show that this approach
significantly decreases labeling effort and improves rare object search on
realistic data with inherent class-imbalance and cluttered scenes.</span>

                                        <span>Learning socially-aware motion representations is at the core of recent
advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot
navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representations
learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop
predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises
from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with
ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes
from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from &quot;positive&quot; examples, it is
difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of &quot;negative&quot; examples
like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly
modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social
contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by
discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii)
we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare
but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision
rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement
learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several
benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-nce.</span>

combining learned data abstraction, nonlinear filtering, and time-optimal
trajectory planning. The system has successfully been deployed at the first
autonomous drone racing world championship: the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.
Contrary to traditional drone racing systems, which only detect the next gate,
our approach makes use of any visible gate and takes advantage of multiple,
simultaneous gate detections to compensate for drift in the state estimate and
build a global map of the gates. The global map and drift-compensated state
estimate allow the drone to navigate through the race course even when the
gates are not immediately visible and further enable to plan a near
time-optimal path through the race course in real time based on approximate
drone dynamics. The proposed system has been demonstrated to successfully guide
the drone through tight race courses reaching speeds up to 8m/s and ranked
second at the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.</span>

binary segmentation masks and per-pixel affinity fields. These affinity fields,
along with the binary masks, can then be used to cluster lane pixels
horizontally and vertically into corresponding lane instances in a
post-processing step. This clustering is achieved through a simple row-by-row
decoding process with little overhead; such an approach allows LaneAF to detect
a variable number of lanes without assuming a fixed or maximum number of lanes.
Moreover, this form of clustering is more interpretable in comparison to
previous visual clustering approaches, and can be analyzed to identify and
correct sources of error. Qualitative and quantitative results obtained on
popular lane detection datasets demonstrate the model&#x27;s ability to detect and
cluster lanes effectively and robustly. Our proposed approach sets a new
state-of-the-art on the challenging CULane dataset and the recently introduced
Unsupervised LLAMAS dataset.</span>

multimodal nature. While generative adversarial networks can learn a
distribution over future trajectories, they tend to predict out-of-distribution
samples when the distribution of future trajectories is a mixture of multiple,
possibly disconnected modes. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-generator model for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Each generator
specializes in learning a distribution over trajectories routing towards one of
the primary modes in the scene, while a second network learns a categorical
distribution over these generators, conditioned on the dynamics and scene
input. This architecture allows us to effectively sample from specialized
generators and to significantly reduce the out-of-distribution samples compared
to single generator methods.</span>

image. This estimation uses a neural network (NN) obtained in two stages. In
the first stage, we trained the base NN, which has one regression head and four
regression via classification (RvC) heads. We build the ensemble of offsets
using small offsets of face bounding boxes. In the second stage, we perform
knowledge distillation (KD) from the ensemble of offsets of the base NN into
the final NN with one RvC head. On the main test protocol, the use of the
offset ensemble improves the results of the base NN, and the KD improves the
results from the offset ensemble. The KD improves the results by an average of
7.7\% compared to the non-ensemble version. The proposed NN on the main test
protocol improves the state-of-the-art result on AFLW2000 and approaches, with
only a minimal gap, the state-of-the-art result on BIWI. Our NN uses only head
pose data, but the previous state-of-the-art model also uses facial landmarks
during training. We have made publicly available trained NNs and face bounding
boxes for the 300W-LP, AFLW, AFLW2000, and BIWI datasets. KD-ResNet152 has the
best results, and KD-ResNet18 has a better result on the AFLW2000 dataset than

advancements, fast and scalable hardware solutions and large availability of
structured image data. Convolutional Neural Networks trained on supervised
tasks with backpropagation learn to extract meaningful representations from raw
pixels automatically, and surpass shallow methods in image understanding.
Though convenient, data-driven feature learning is prone to dataset bias: a
network learns its parameters from training signals alone, and will usually
perform poorly if train and test distribution differ. To alleviate this
problem, research on Domain Generalization (DG), Domain Adaptation (DA) and
their variations is increasing. This thesis contributes to these research
topics by presenting novel and effective ways to solve the dataset bias problem
in its various settings. We propose new frameworks for Domain Generalization
and Domain Adaptation which make use of feature aggregation strategies and
visual transformations via data-augmentation and multi-task integration of
self-supervision. We also design an algorithm that adapts an object detection
model to any out of distribution sample at test time. With through
experimentation, we show how our proposed solutions outperform competitive

                                        <span>Supervised learning is constrained by the availability of labeled data, which
are especially expensive to acquire in the field of digital pathology. Making
use of open-source data for pre-training or using domain adaptation can be a
way to overcome this issue. However, pre-trained networks often fail to
generalize to new test domains that are not distributed identically due to
variations in tissue stainings, types, and textures. Additionally, current
domain adaptation methods mainly rely on fully-labeled source datasets. In this
work, we propose SRA, which takes advantage of self-supervised learning to
perform domain adaptation and removes the necessity of a fully-labeled source
dataset. SRA can effectively transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained
from a few labeled source domain&#x27;s data to a new target domain without
requiring additional tissue annotations. Our method harnesses both domains&#x27;
structures by capturing visual similarity with intra-domain and cross-domain
self-supervision. Moreover, we present a generalized formulation of our
approach that allows the architecture to learn from multi-source domains. We
show that our proposed method outperforms baselines for domain adaptation of
colorectal tissue type classification and further validate our approach on our
in-house clinical cohort. The code and models are available open-source:

                                        <span>Transparent objects, such as glass walls and doors, constitute architectural
obstacles hindering the mobility of people with low vision or blindness. For
instance, the open space behind glass doors is inaccessible, unless it is
correctly perceived and interacted with. However, traditional assistive
technologies rarely cover the segmentation of these safety-critical transparent
objects. In this paper, we build a wearable system with a novel dual-head
Transformer for Transparency (Trans4Trans) perception model, which can segment
general- and transparent objects. The two dense segmentation results are
further combined with depth information in the system to help users navigate
safely and assist them to negotiate transparent obstacles. We propose a
lightweight Transformer Parsing Module (TPM) to perform multi-scale feature
interpretation in the transformer-based decoder. Benefiting from TPM, the
double decoders can perform joint learning from corresponding datasets to
pursue robustness, meanwhile maintain efficiency on a portable GPU, with
negligible calculation increase. The entire Trans4Trans model is constructed in
a symmetrical encoder-decoder architecture, which outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on the test sets of Stanford2D3D and Trans10K-v2 datasets, obtaining
mIoU of 45.13% and 75.14%, respectively. Through a user study and various
pre-tests conducted in indoor and outdoor scenes, the usability and reliability
of our assistive system have been extensively verified. Meanwhile, the
Tran4Trans model has outstanding performances on driving scene datasets. On
Cityscapes, ACDC, and DADA-seg datasets corresponding to common environments,
adverse weather, and traffic accident scenarios, mIoU scores of 81.5%, 76.3%,
and 39.2% are obtained, demonstrating its high efficiency and robustness for
real-world transportation applications.</span>

with a label noise-robust classification head requires fine-tuning the
representation in order to achieve state-of-the-art performances. Since
fine-tuned representations are shown to outperform frozen ones, one can
conclude that noise-robust classification heads are indeed able to promote
meaningful representations if provided with a suitable starting point.
Experiments are conducted to draw a comprehensive picture of performances by
featuring six methods and nine noise instances of three different kinds (none,
symmetric, and asymmetric). In presence of noise the experiments show that fine
tuning of Contrastive representation allows the six methods to achieve better
results than end-to-end learning and represent a new reference compare to the

                                        <span>The adversarial patch attack against image classification models aims to
inject adversarially crafted pixels within a localized restricted image region
(i.e., a patch) for inducing model misclassification. This attack can be
realized in the physical world by printing and attaching the patch to the
victim object and thus imposes a real-world threat to computer vision systems.
To counter this threat, we propose PatchCleanser as a certifiably robust
defense against adversarial patches that is compatible with any image
classifier. In PatchCleanser, we perform two rounds of pixel masking on the
input image to neutralize the effect of the adversarial patch. In the first
round of masking, we apply a set of carefully generated masks to the input
image and evaluate the model prediction on every masked image. If model
predictions on all one-masked images reach a unanimous agreement, we output the
agreed prediction label. Otherwise, we perform a second round of masking to
settle the disagreement, in which we evaluate model predictions on two-masked
images to robustly recover the correct prediction label. Notably, we can prove
that our defense will always make correct predictions on certain images against
any adaptive white-box attacker within our threat model, achieving certified
robustness. We extensively evaluate our defense on the ImageNet, ImageNette,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Flowers-102 datasets and demonstrate that our
defense achieves similar clean accuracy as state-of-the-art classification
models and also significantly improves certified robustness from prior works.
Notably, our defense can achieve 83.8% top-1 clean accuracy and 60.4% top-1
certified robust accuracy against a 2%-pixel square patch anywhere on the
1000-class ImageNet dataset.</span>

networks, which demands efficient and effective learning algorithms. At the
same time, labels may only be available for some networks, which demands these
algorithms to be able to adapt to unlabeled networks. Domain-adaptive hash
learning has enjoyed considerable success in the computer vision community in
many practical tasks due to its lower cost in both retrieval time and storage
footprint. However, it has not been applied to multiple-domain networks. In
this work, we bridge this gap by developing an unsupervised domain-adaptive
hash learning method for networks, dubbed UDAH. Specifically, we develop four
{task-specific yet correlated} components: (1) network structure preservation
via a hard groupwise contrastive loss, (2) relaxation-free supervised hashing,
(3) cross-domain intersected discriminators, and (4) semantic center alignment.
We conduct a wide range of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our method on a range of tasks including link prediction, node
classification, and neighbor recommendation. Our evaluation results demonstrate
that our model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art
conventional discrete embedding methods over all the tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Describing images using natural language is widely known as image captioning,
which has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision
and natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning
models achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and
SPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other
similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few
pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,
which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between
objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same
album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the
distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning
Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar
group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a
group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that
are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other
images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,
resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in
the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and
GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate
(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results
indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of
several baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both
accuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the
quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric
DisWordRate.</span>

a hologram in order to reconstruct its amplitude and phase. This step is called
auto-focusing and it is conventionally solved by first reconstructing a stack
of images and then by sharpening each reconstructed image using a focus metric
such as entropy or variance. The distance corresponding to the sharpest image
is considered the focal position. This approach, while effective, is
computationally demanding and time-consuming. In this paper, the determination
of the distance is performed by Deep Learning (DL). Two deep learning (DL)
architectures are compared: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)and Visual
transformer (ViT). ViT and CNN are used to cope with the problem of
auto-focusing as a classification problem. Compared to a first attempt [11] in
which the distance between two consecutive classes was 100{\mu}m, our proposal
allows us to drastically reduce this distance to 1{\mu}m. Moreover, ViT reaches

                                        <span>Implicit neural representation is a recent approach to learn shape
collections as zero level-sets of neural networks, where each shape is
represented by a latent code. So far, the focus has been shape reconstruction,
while shape generalization was mostly left to generic encoder-decoder or
auto-decoder regularization.

In this paper we advocate deformation-aware regularization for implicit
neural representations, aiming at producing plausible deformations as latent
code changes. The challenge is that implicit representations do not capture
correspondences between different shapes, which makes it difficult to represent
and regularize their deformations. Thus, we propose to pair the implicit
representation of the shapes with an explicit, piecewise linear deformation
field, learned as an auxiliary function. We demonstrate that, by regularizing
these deformation fields, we can encourage the implicit neural representation
to induce natural deformations in the learned shape space, such as
as-rigid-as-possible deformations.</span>

neural networks has shown great potential. However, such methods assume a
stationary data distribution with all scenes simultaneously available during
training. In this paper, we approach the problem of visual localization in a
continual learning setup -- whereby the model is trained on scenes in an
incremental manner. Our results show that similar to the classification domain,
non-stationary data induces catastrophic forgetting in deep networks for visual
localization. To address this issue, a strong baseline based on storing and
replaying images from a fixed buffer is proposed. Furthermore, we propose a new
sampling method based on coverage score (Buff-CS) that adapts the existing
sampling strategies in the buffering process to the problem of visual
localization. Results demonstrate consistent improvements over standard
buffering methods on two challenging datasets -- 7Scenes, 12Scenes, and also
19Scenes by combining the former scenes.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot object detection, which aims at detecting novel objects rapidly from
extremely few annotated examples of previously unseen classes, has attracted
significant research interest in the community. Most existing approaches employ
the Faster R-CNN as basic detection framework, yet, due to the lack of tailored
considerations for data-scarce scenario, their performance is often not
satisfactory. In this paper, we look closely into the conventional Faster R-CNN
and analyze its contradictions from two orthogonal perspectives, namely
multi-stage (RPN vs. RCNN) and multi-task (classification vs. localization). To
resolve these issues, we propose a simple yet effective architecture, named
Decoupled Faster R-CNN (DeFRCN). To be concrete, we extend Faster R-CNN by
introducing Gradient Decoupled Layer for multi-stage decoupling and
Prototypical Calibration Block for multi-task decoupling. The former is a novel
deep layer with redefining the feature-forward operation and gradient-backward
operation for decoupling its subsequent layer and preceding layer, and the
latter is an offline prototype-based classification model with taking the
proposals from detector as input and boosting the original classification
scores with additional pairwise scores for calibration. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmarks show our framework is remarkably superior to other
existing approaches and establishes a new state-of-the-art in few-shot
literature.</span>

                                        <span>Continual learning is the problem of learning and retaining knowledge through
time over multiple tasks and environments. Research has primarily focused on
the incremental classification setting, where new tasks/classes are added at
discrete time intervals. Such an &quot;offline&quot; setting does not evaluate the
ability of agents to learn effectively and efficiently, since an agent can
perform multiple learning epochs without any time limitation when a task is
added. We argue that &quot;online&quot; continual learning, where data is a single
continuous stream without task boundaries, enables evaluating both information
retention and online learning efficacy. In online continual learning, each
incoming small batch of data is first used for testing and then added to the
training set, making the problem truly online. Trained models are later
evaluated on historical data to assess information retention. We introduce a
new benchmark for online continual visual learning that exhibits large scale
and natural distribution shifts. Through a large-scale analysis, we identify
critical and previously unobserved phenomena of gradient-based optimization in
continual learning, and propose effective strategies for improving
gradient-based online continual learning with real data. The source code and

the face of multiple identities, which can lead to building faulty identity
links in operations like border checks. While creating a morphed face detector
(MFD), training on all possible attack types is essential to achieve good
detection performance. Therefore, investigating new methods of creating
morphing attacks drives the generalizability of MADs. Creating morphing attacks
was performed on the image level, by landmark interpolation, or on the
latent-space level, by manipulating latent vectors in a generative adversarial
network. The earlier results in varying blending artifacts and the latter
results in synthetic-like striping artifacts. This work presents the novel
morphing pipeline, ReGenMorph, to eliminate the LMA blending artifacts by using
a GAN-based generation, as well as, eliminate the manipulation in the latent
space, resulting in visibly realistic morphed images compared to previous
works. The generated ReGenMorph appearance is compared to recent morphing
approaches and evaluated for face recognition vulnerability and attack
detectability, whether as known or unknown attacks.</span>

actions for preventing loss of human life and property in real world
surveillance systems. Although the recent automation in surveillance systems
are capable of detecting the anomalies, but they still need human efforts for
categorizing the anomalies and taking necessary preventive actions. This is due
to the lack of methodology performing both anomaly detection and classification
for real world scenarios. Thinking of a fully automatized surveillance system,
which is capable of both detecting and classifying the anomalies that need
immediate actions, a joint anomaly detection and classification method is a
pressing need. The task of joint detection and classification of anomalies
becomes challenging due to the unavailability of dense annotated videos
pertaining to anomalous classes, which is a crucial factor for training modern
deep architecture. Furthermore, doing it through manual human effort seems
impossible. Thus, we propose a method that jointly handles the anomaly
detection and classification in a single framework by adopting a
weakly-supervised learning paradigm. In weakly-supervised learning instead of
dense temporal annotations, only video-level labels are sufficient for
learning. The proposed model is validated on a large-scale publicly available

                                        <span>Recently, some works found an interesting phenomenon that adversarially
robust classifiers can generate good images comparable to generative models. We
investigate this phenomenon from an energy perspective and provide a novel
explanation. We reformulate adversarial example generation, adversarial
training, and image generation in terms of an energy function. We find that
adversarial training contributes to obtaining an energy function that is flat
and has low energy around the real data, which is the key for generative
capability. Based on our new understanding, we further propose a better
adversarial training method, Joint Energy Adversarial Training (JEAT), which
can generate high-quality images and achieve new state-of-the-art robustness
under a wide range of attacks. The Inception Score of the images (CIFAR-10)
generated by JEAT is 8.80, much better than original robust classifiers (7.50).
In particular, we achieve new state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 (from

                                        <span>Medical image classification is often challenging for two reasons: a lack of
labelled examples due to expensive and time-consuming annotation protocols, and
imbalanced class labels due to the relative scarcity of disease-positive
individuals in the wider population. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods
exist for dealing with a lack of labels, but they generally do not address the
problem of class imbalance. In this study we propose Adaptive Blended
Consistency Loss (ABCL), a drop-in replacement for consistency loss in
perturbation-based SSL methods. ABCL counteracts data skew by adaptively mixing
the target class distribution of the consistency loss in accordance with class
frequency. Our experiments with ABCL reveal improvements to unweighted average
recall on two different imbalanced medical image classification datasets when
compared with existing consistency losses that are not designed to counteract
class imbalance.</span>

Specifically, contact-based fingerprint recognition systems reign supreme due
to their robustness, portability and the extensive research work done in the
field. However, these systems suffer from issues such as hygiene, sensor
degradation due to constant physical contact, and latent fingerprint threats.
In this paper, we propose an approach for developing a contactless fingerprint
recognition system that captures finger photo from a distance using an image
sensor in a suitable environment. The captured finger photos are then processed
further to obtain global and local (minutiae-based) features. Specifically, a
Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract global
features from a given finger photo. The proposed system computes matching
scores from CNN-based features and minutiae-based features. Finally, the two
scores are fused to obtain the final matching score between the probe and
reference fingerprint templates. Most importantly, the proposed system is
developed using the Nvidia Jetson Nano development kit, which allows us to
perform contactless fingerprint recognition in real-time with minimum latency
and acceptable matching accuracy. The performance of the proposed system is
evaluated on an in-house IITI contactless fingerprint dataset (IITI-CFD)
containing 105train and 100 test subjects. The proposed system achieves an
equal-error-rate of 2.19% on IITI-CFD.</span>

estimation is the task of predicting semantics and occupancy in bird&#x27;s eye
view. The term amodal implies we also reason about entities in the scene that
are occluded or truncated in image space. While several recent efforts have
tackled this problem, there is a lack of standardization in task specification,
datasets, and evaluation protocols. We address these gaps with AutoLay, a
dataset and benchmark for amodal layout estimation from monocular images.
AutoLay encompasses driving imagery from two popular datasets: KITTI and
Argoverse. In addition to fine-grained attributes such as lanes, sidewalks, and
vehicles, we also provide semantically annotated 3D point clouds. We implement
several baselines and bleeding edge approaches, and release our data and code.</span>

navigate in realistic environments using natural language instructions. Given
the scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image
and language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments
remains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve
generalization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing
small-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements.
In this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN
dataset. We first collect image-caption (IC) pairs from hundreds of thousands
of listings from online rental marketplaces. Using IC pairs we next propose
automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs.
We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal
order inside PI pairs. We use BnB pretrain our Airbert model that can be
adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms
state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring

significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation,

deblurring based on inverse kernels. In a defocused image, the blur shapes are
similar among pixels although the blur sizes can spatially vary. To utilize the
property with inverse kernels, we exploit the observation that when only the
size of a defocus blur changes while keeping the shape, the shape of the
corresponding inverse kernel remains the same and only the scale changes. Based
on the observation, we propose a kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolutional
(KPAC) block specifically designed by incorporating the property of inverse
kernels for single image defocus deblurring. To effectively simulate the
invariant shapes of inverse kernels with different scales, KPAC shares the same
convolutional weights among multiple atrous convolution layers. To efficiently
simulate the varying scales of inverse kernels, KPAC consists of only a few
atrous convolution layers with different dilations and learns per-pixel scale
attentions to aggregate the outputs of the layers. KPAC also utilizes the shape
attention to combine the outputs of multiple convolution filters in each atrous
convolution layer, to deal with defocus blur with a slightly varying shape. We
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a much
smaller number of parameters than previous methods.</span>

                                        <span>Warping-based video stabilizers smooth camera trajectory by constraining each
pixel&#x27;s displacement and warp stabilized frames from unstable ones accordingly.
However, since the view outside the boundary is not available during warping,
the resulting holes around the boundary of the stabilized frame must be
discarded (i.e., cropping) to maintain visual consistency, and thus does leads
to a tradeoff between stability and cropping ratio. In this paper, we make a
first attempt to address this issue by proposing a new Out-of-boundary View
Synthesis (OVS) method. By the nature of spatial coherence between adjacent
frames and within each frame, OVS extrapolates the out-of-boundary view by
aligning adjacent frames to each reference one. Technically, it first
calculates the optical flow and propagates it to the outer boundary region
according to the affinity, and then warps pixels accordingly. OVS can be
integrated into existing warping-based stabilizers as a plug-and-play module to
significantly improve the cropping ratio of the stabilized results. In
addition, stability is improved because the jitter amplification effect caused
by cropping and resizing is reduced. Experimental results on the NUS benchmark
show that OVS can improve the performance of five representative
state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual
quality. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Annbless/OVS_Stabilization.</span>

with the same identity as a query person across multiple cameras. Spatial and
temporal distractors in person videos, such as background clutter and partial
occlusions over frames, respectively, make this task much more challenging than
image-based person reID. We observe that spatial distractors appear
consistently in a particular location, and temporal distractors show several
patterns, e.g., partial occlusions occur in the first few frames, where such
patterns provide informative cues for predicting which frames to focus on
(i.e., temporal attentions). Based on this, we introduce a novel Spatial and
Temporal Memory Networks (STMN). The spatial memory stores features for spatial
distractors that frequently emerge across video frames, while the temporal
memory saves attentions which are optimized for typical temporal patterns in
person videos. We leverage the spatial and temporal memories to refine
frame-level person representations and to aggregate the refined frame-level
features into a sequence-level person representation, respectively, effectively
handling spatial and temporal distractors in person videos. We also introduce a
memory spread loss preventing our model from addressing particular items only
in the memories. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, including MARS,
DukeMTMC-VideoReID, and LS-VID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</span>

most details with only contour reserved, e.g. cartoon. However, in terms of
visual perception of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the ability for recognizing
abstract objects (visual objects with lost information) is still a challenge.
In this work, we investigate this issue from an adversarial viewpoint: will the
performance of DNNs decrease even for the images only losing a little

\textit{AdvDrop}, which crafts adversarial examples by dropping existing
information of images. Previously, most adversarial attacks add extra
disturbing information on clean images explicitly. Opposite to previous works,
our proposed work explores the adversarial robustness of DNN models in a novel
perspective by dropping imperceptible details to craft adversarial examples. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{AdvDrop} by extensive experiments, and

transformers (ViTs) have appeared as a competitive alternative to CNNs,
yielding similar levels of performance while possessing several interesting
properties that could prove beneficial for medical imaging tasks. In this work,
we explore whether it is time to move to transformer-based models or if we
should keep working with CNNs - can we trivially switch to transformers? If so,
what are the advantages and drawbacks of switching to ViTs for medical image
diagnosis? We consider these questions in a series of experiments on three
mainstream medical image datasets. Our findings show that, while CNNs perform

capability of building models that are effective, even when scarce amounts of
labeled data are available. In this paper, we present a framework and specific
tasks for self-supervised training of multichannel models, such as the fusion
of multispectral and synthetic aperture radar images. We show that the proposed
self-supervised approach is highly effective at learning features that
correlate with the labels for land cover classification. This is enabled by an
explicit design of pretraining tasks which promotes bridging the gaps between
sensing modalities and exploiting the spectral characteristics of the input.
When limited labels are available, using the proposed self-supervised
pretraining and supervised finetuning for land cover classification with SAR
and multispectral data outperforms conventional approaches such as purely
supervised learning, initialization from training on Imagenet and recent
self-supervised approaches for computer vision tasks.</span>

learned from a collection of semantic-segmented depth images captured from
different unknown scenes. Given a room with a specified size, our method
automatically generates 3D objects in a room from a randomly sampled latent
code. Different from existing methods that represent an indoor scene with the
type, location, and other properties of objects in the room and learn the scene
layout from a collection of complete 3D indoor scenes, our method models each
indoor scene as a 3D semantic scene volume and learns a volumetric generative
adversarial network (GAN) from a collection of 2.5D partial observations of 3D
scenes. To this end, we apply a differentiable projection layer to project the
generated 3D semantic scene volumes into semantic-segmented depth images and
design a new multiple-view discriminator for learning the complete 3D scene
volume from 2.5D semantic-segmented depth images. Compared to existing methods,
our method not only efficiently reduces the workload of modeling and acquiring
3D scenes for training, but also produces better object shapes and their
detailed layouts in the scene. We evaluate our method with different indoor
scene datasets and demonstrate the advantages of our method. We also extend our
method for generating 3D indoor scenes from semantic-segmented depth images
inferred from RGB images of real scenes.</span>

                                        <span>Single image deraining is important for many high-level computer vision tasks
since the rain streaks can severely degrade the visibility of images, thereby
affecting the recognition and analysis of the image. Recently, many CNN-based
methods have been proposed for rain removal. Although these methods can remove
part of the rain streaks, it is difficult for them to adapt to real-world
scenarios and restore high-quality rain-free images with clear and accurate
structures. To solve this problem, we propose a Structure-Preserving Deraining
Network (SPDNet) with RCP guidance. SPDNet directly generates high-quality
rain-free images with clear and accurate structures under the guidance of RCP
but does not rely on any rain-generating assumptions. Specifically, we found
that the RCP of images contains more accurate structural information than rainy
images. Therefore, we introduced it to our deraining network to protect
structure information of the rain-free image. Meanwhile, a Wavelet-based
Multi-Level Module (WMLM) is proposed as the backbone for learning the
background information of rainy images and an Interactive Fusion Module (IFM)
is designed to make full use of RCP information. In addition, an iterative
guidance strategy is proposed to gradually improve the accuracy of RCP,
refining the result in a progressive path. Extensive experimental results on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/Joyies/SPDNet</span>

systems has enabled the use of vision-based and LiDAR-based methods to achieve

different areas, especially in computer vision, which has also attracted the
attention of space researchers. However, spacecraft navigation differs from

This survey aims to systematically investigate the current deep learning-based
autonomous spacecraft relative navigation methods, focusing on concrete orbital
applications such as spacecraft rendezvous and landing on small bodies or the
Moon. The fundamental characteristics, primary motivations, and contributions
of deep learning-based relative navigation algorithms are first summarised from
three perspectives of spacecraft rendezvous, asteroid exploration, and terrain
navigation. Furthermore, popular visual tracking benchmarks and their

                                        <span>Most deep models for underwater image enhancement resort to training on
synthetic datasets based on underwater image formation models. Although
promising performances have been achieved, they are still limited by two
problems: (1) existing underwater image synthesis models have an intrinsic
limitation, in which the homogeneous ambient light is usually randomly
generated and many important dependencies are ignored, and thus the synthesized
training data cannot adequately express characteristics of real underwater
environments; (2) most of deep models disregard lots of favorable underwater
priors and heavily rely on training data, which extensively limits their
application ranges. To address these limitations, a new underwater synthetic
dataset is first established, in which a revised ambient light synthesis
equation is embedded. The revised equation explicitly defines the complex
mathematical relationship among intensity values of the ambient light in RGB
channels and many dependencies such as surface-object depth, water types, etc,
which helps to better simulate real underwater scene appearances. Secondly, a
unified framework is proposed, named ANA-SYN, which can effectively enhance
underwater images under collaborations of priors (underwater domain knowledge)
and data information (underwater distortion distribution). The proposed
framework includes an analysis network and a synthesis network, one for priors
exploration and another for priors integration. To exploit more accurate
priors, the significance of each prior for the input image is explored in the
analysis network and an adaptive weighting module is designed to dynamically
recalibrate them. Meanwhile, a novel prior guidance module is introduced in the
synthesis network, which effectively aggregates the prior and data features and
thus provides better hybrid information to perform the more reasonable image
enhancement.</span>

                                        <span>Domain generalization approaches aim to learn a domain invariant prediction
model for unknown target domains from multiple training source domains with
different distributions. Significant efforts have recently been committed to
broad domain generalization, which is a challenging and topical problem in
machine learning and computer vision communities. Most previous domain
generalization approaches assume that the conditional distribution across the
domains remain the same across the source domains and learn a domain invariant
model by minimizing the marginal distributions. However, the assumption of a
stable conditional distribution of the training source domains does not really
hold in practice. The hyperplane learned from the source domains will easily
misclassify samples scattered at the boundary of clusters or far from their
corresponding class centres. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose a
discriminative domain-invariant adversarial network (DDIAN) for domain
generalization. The discriminativeness of the features are guaranteed through a
discriminative feature module and domain-invariant features are guaranteed
through the global domain and local sub-domain alignment modules. Extensive
experiments on several benchmarks show that DDIAN achieves better prediction on
unseen target data during training compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization approaches.</span>

of a pre-trained GAN model. Unfortunately, such in-domain latent codes can be
found only for in-range images that align with the training images of a GAN
model. In this paper, we propose BDInvert, a novel GAN inversion approach to
semantic editing of out-of-range images that are geometrically unaligned with
the training images of a GAN model. To find a latent code that is semantically
editable, BDInvert inverts an input out-of-range image into an alternative
latent space than the original latent space. We also propose a regularized

alternative space. Our experiments show that BDInvert effectively supports
semantic editing of out-of-range images with geometric transformations.</span>

                                        <span>Social media such as Instagram and Twitter have become important platforms
for marketing and selling illicit drugs. Detection of online illicit drug
trafficking has become critical to combat the online trade of illicit drugs.
However, the legal status often varies spatially and temporally; even for the
same drug, federal and state legislation can have different regulations about
its legality. Meanwhile, more drug trafficking events are disguised as a novel
form of advertising commenting leading to information heterogeneity.
Accordingly, accurate detection of illicit drug trafficking events (IDTEs) from
social media has become even more challenging. In this work, we conduct the
first systematic study on fine-grained detection of IDTEs on Instagram. We
propose to take a deep multimodal multilabel learning (DMML) approach to detect
IDTEs and demonstrate its effectiveness on a newly constructed dataset called
multimodal IDTE(MM-IDTE). Specifically, our model takes text and image data as
the input and combines multimodal information to predict multiple labels of
illicit drugs. Inspired by the success of BERT, we have developed a
self-supervised multimodal bidirectional transformer by jointly fine-tuning
pretrained text and image encoders. We have constructed a large-scale dataset
MM-IDTE with manually annotated multiple drug labels to support fine-grained
detection of illicit drugs. Extensive experimental results on the MM-IDTE
dataset show that the proposed DMML methodology can accurately detect IDTEs
even in the presence of special characters and style changes attempting to
evade detection.</span>

contributing to sustainable development of the society spurred in the past
decade,numerous Big Data projects and initiatives are focusing on the Earth
Observation (EO). The number of Big Data EO applications has grown extremely
worldwide almost simultaneously with other scientific and technological areas
of the human knowledge due to the revolutionary technological progress in the
space and information technology sciences. The substantial contribution to this
development are the space programs of the renowned space agencies, such as
NASA, ESA,Roskosmos, JAXA, DLR, INPE, ISRO, CNES etc. A snap-shot of the
current Big Data sets from available satellite missions covering the Bulgarian
territory is also presented. This short overview of the geoscience Big Data
collection with a focus on EO will emphasize to the multiple Vs of EO in order
to provide a snapshot on the current state-of-the-art in EO data preservation
and manipulation. Main modern approaches for compressing, clustering and
modelling EO in the geoinformation science for Big Data analysis,
interpretation and visualization for a variety of applications are outlined.
Special attention is paid to the contemporary EO data modelling and
visualization systems.</span>

super-resolution (SISR) tasks with the prosperous development of deep neural
networks (DNNs), the deep learning methods are confronted with the computation
and memory consumption issues in practice, especially for resource-limited
platforms such as mobile devices. To overcome the challenge and facilitate the
real-time deployment of SISR tasks on mobile, we combine neural architecture
search with pruning search and propose an automatic search framework that
derives sparse super-resolution (SR) models with high image quality while
satisfying the real-time inference requirement. To decrease the search cost, we
leverage the weight sharing strategy by introducing a supernet and decouple the
search problem into three stages, including supernet construction,
compiler-aware architecture and pruning search, and compiler-aware pruning
ratio search. With the proposed framework, we are the first to achieve
real-time SR inference (with only tens of milliseconds per frame) for
implementing 720p resolution with competitive image quality (in terms of PSNR
and SSIM) on mobile platforms (Samsung Galaxy S20).</span>

                                        <span>As an important task in multimodal context understanding, Text-VQA (Visual
Question Answering) aims at question answering through reading text information
in images. It differentiates from the original VQA task as Text-VQA requires
large amounts of scene-text relationship understanding, in addition to the
cross-modal grounding capability. In this paper, we propose Localize, Group,
and Select (LOGOS), a novel model which attempts to tackle this problem from
multiple aspects. LOGOS leverages two grounding tasks to better localize the
key information of the image, utilizes scene text clustering to group
individual OCR tokens, and learns to select the best answer from different
sources of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) texts. Experiments show that
LOGOS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two Text-VQA benchmarks
without using additional OCR annotation data. Ablation studies and analysis
demonstrate the capability of LOGOS to bridge different modalities and better
understand scene text.</span>

derived from new results in the SDE literature on estimating infinitesimal

agreement between the needs of an application/task and the inherent properties

obtain a very simple and efficient plug-in layer that can be incorporated

(time-varying) texture map for a dynamic object using a single RGB-D camera.
The input of our framework is a 3D template model and an RGB-D image sequence.
Since there are invisible areas of the object at a frame in a single-camera
setup, textures of such areas need to be borrowed from other frames. We
formulate the problem as an MRF optimization and define cost functions to
reconstruct a plausible spatiotemporal texture for a dynamic object.
Experimental results demonstrate that our spatiotemporal textures can reproduce
the active appearances of captured objects better than approaches using a
single texture map.</span>

and edit art, including generating random images, finding images &quot;like&quot; some
query, and modifying content or style. Further, recent advancements enable
training with small datasets. We apply these methods to synthesize card art, by
training on a novel Yu-Gi-Oh dataset. While noise inputs to StyleGAN2 are
essential for good synthesis, we find that, for small datasets, coarse-scale
noise interferes with latent variables because both control long-scale image
effects. We observe over-aggressive variation in art with changes in noise and
weak content control via latent variable edits. Here, we demonstrate that
training a modified StyleGAN2, where coarse-scale noise is suppressed, removes
these unwanted effects. We obtain a superior FID; changes in noise result in
local exploration of style; and identity control is markedly improved. These
results and analysis lead towards a GAN-assisted art synthesis tool for digital
artists of all skill levels, which can be used in film, games, or any creative
industry for artistic ideation.</span>

recognise novel classes with only a few labeled examples in the last few years.
Few-shot learning (FSL) for action recognition is a challenging task of
recognising novel action categories which are represented by few instances in
the training data. We propose a novel variational inference based architectural
framework (HF-AR) for few shot activity recognition. Our framework leverages
volume-preserving Householder Flow to learn a flexible posterior distribution
of the novel classes. This results in better performance as compared to
state-of-the-art few shot approaches for human activity recognition. approach
consists of base model and an adapter model. Our architecture consists of a
base model and an adapter model. The base model is trained on seen classes and
it computes an embedding that represent the spatial and temporal insights
extracted from the input video, e.g. combination of Resnet-152 and LSTM based
encoder-decoder model. The adapter model applies a series of Householder
transformations to compute a flexible posterior distribution that lends higher
accuracy in the few shot approach. Extensive experiments on three well-known
datasets: UCF101, HMDB51 and Something-Something-V2, demonstrate similar or
better performance on 1-shot and 5-shot classification as compared to
state-of-the-art few shot approaches that use only RGB frame sequence as input.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore variational inference
along with householder transformations to capture the full rank covariance
matrix of posterior distribution, for few shot learning in activity
recognition.</span>

                                        <span>Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) extend the standard
unconditional GAN framework to learning joint data-label distributions from
samples, and have been established as powerful generative models capable of
generating high-fidelity imagery. A challenge of training such a model lies in
properly infusing class information into its generator and discriminator. For
the discriminator, class conditioning can be achieved by either (1) directly
incorporating labels as input or (2) involving labels in an auxiliary
classification loss. In this paper, we show that the former directly aligns the
class-conditioned fake-and-real data distributions
$P(\text{image}|\text{class})$ ({\em data matching}), while the latter aligns
data-conditioned class distributions $P(\text{class}|\text{image})$ ({\em label
matching}). Although class separability does not directly translate to sample
quality and becomes a burden if classification itself is intrinsically
difficult, the discriminator cannot provide useful guidance for the generator
if features of distinct classes are mapped to the same point and thus become
inseparable. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a Dual Projection GAN
(P2GAN) model that learns to balance between {\em data matching} and {\em label
matching}. We then propose an improved cGAN model with Auxiliary Classification
that directly aligns the fake and real conditionals
$P(\text{class}|\text{image})$ by minimizing their $f$-divergence. Experiments
on a synthetic Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) dataset and a variety of real-world
datasets including CIFAR100, ImageNet, and VGGFace2 demonstrate the efficacy of
our proposed models.</span>

                                        <span>Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods show excellent
performance with dense cameras and small depth ranges. However, non-learning
based approaches still outperform for scenes with large depth ranges and
sparser wide-baseline views, in part due to their PatchMatch optimization over
pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end trainable PatchMatch-based MVS approach that combines
advantages of trainable costs and regularizations with pixelwise estimates. To
overcome the challenge of the non-differentiable PatchMatch optimization that
involves iterative sampling and hard decisions, we use reinforcement learning
to minimize expected photometric cost and maximize likelihood of ground truth
depth and normals. We incorporate normal estimation by using dilated patch
kernels, and propose a recurrent cost regularization that applies beyond
frontal plane-sweep algorithms to our pixelwise depth/normal estimates. We
evaluate our method on widely used MVS benchmarks, ETH3D and Tanks and Temples
(TnT), and compare to other state of the art learning based MVS models. On
ETH3D, our method outperforms other recent learning-based approaches and
performs comparably on advanced TnT.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-modal generation has been widely explored in recent years. Current
research directions involve generating text based on an image or vice versa. In
this paper, we propose a new task called CIGLI: Conditional Image Generation
from Language and Image. Instead of generating an image based on text as in
text-image generation, this task requires the generation of an image from a
textual description and an image prompt. We designed a new dataset to ensure
that the text description describes information from both images, and that
solely analyzing the description is insufficient to generate an image. We then
propose a novel language-image fusion model which improves the performance over
two established baseline methods, as evaluated by quantitative (automatic) and
qualitative (human) evaluations. The code and dataset is available at

decrease if every patient could get suitable treatment by the healthcare
system. Machine learning, especially computer vision methods based on deep
learning, can help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat COVID-19
infected cases more efficiently. Hence, infected patients can get better
service from the healthcare system and decrease the number of deaths caused by
the coronavirus. This research proposes a method for segmenting infected lung
regions in a CT image. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network with an
attention mechanism is used to detect infected areas with complex patterns.
Attention blocks improve the segmentation accuracy by focusing on informative
parts of the image. Furthermore, a generative adversarial network generates
synthetic images for data augmentation and expansion of small available

                                        <span>Videos captured using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) can encode
details regarding the morphological and temporal evolution of a material by
taking snapshots of the microstructure sequentially. However, manual analysis
of such video is tedious, error-prone, unreliable, and prohibitively
time-consuming if one wishes to analyze a significant fraction of frames for
even videos of modest length. In this work, we developed an automated TEM video
analysis system for microstructural features based on the advanced object
detection model called YOLO and tested the system on an in-situ ion irradiation
TEM video of dislocation loops formed in a FeCrAl alloy. The system provides
analysis of features observed in TEM including both static and dynamic
properties using the YOLO-based defect detection module coupled to a geometry
analysis module and a dynamic tracking module. Results show that the system can
achieve human comparable performance with an F1 score of 0.89 for fast,
consistent, and scalable frame-level defect analysis. This result is obtained
on a real but exceptionally clean and stable data set and more challenging data
sets may not achieve this performance. The dynamic tracking also enabled
evaluation of individual defect evolution like per defect growth rate at a
fidelity never before achieved using common human analysis methods. Our work
shows that automatically detecting and tracking interesting microstructures and
properties contained in TEM videos is viable and opens new doors for evaluating
materials dynamics.</span>

applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance, a large body of
academic and non-academic work has shown attacks against their main component -
the image sensor. However, these attacks are limited to coarse-grained and
often suspicious injections because light is used as an attack vector.
Furthermore, due to the nature of optical attacks, they require the
line-of-sight between the adversary and the target camera.

In this paper, we present a novel post-transducer signal injection attack
against CCD image sensors, as they are used in professional, scientific, and
even military settings. We show how electromagnetic emanation can be used to
manipulate the image information captured by a CCD image sensor with the
granularity down to the brightness of individual pixels. We study the
feasibility of our attack and then demonstrate its effects in the scenario of
automatic barcode scanning. Our results indicate that the injected distortion
can disrupt automated vision-based intelligent systems.</span>

urban environments, making it suitable for applications in intelligent
transportation systems like automated vehicles. CenterPoly detects objects by
their center keypoint while predicting a fixed number of polygon vertices for
each object, thus performing detection and segmentation in parallel. Most of
the network parameters are shared by the network heads, making it fast and
lightweight enough to run at real-time speed. To properly convert mask
ground-truth to polygon ground-truth, we designed a vertex selection strategy
to facilitate the learning of the polygons. Additionally, to better segment
overlapping objects in dense urban scenes, we also train a relative depth
branch to determine which instances are closer and which are further, using
available weak annotations. We propose several models with different backbones
to show the possible speed / accuracy trade-offs. The models were trained and

                                        <span>In Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problems, high-level
landmarks have the potential to build compact and informative maps compared to
traditional point-based landmarks. This work is focused on the parameterization
problem of high-level geometric primitives that are most frequently used,
including points, lines, planes, ellipsoids, cylinders, and cones. We first
present a unified representation of those geometric primitives using
\emph{quadrics} which yields a consistent and concise formulation. Then we
further study a decomposed model of quadrics that discloses the symmetric and
degenerated nature of quadrics. Based on the decomposition, we develop
physically meaningful quadrics factors in the settings of the graph-SLAM
problem. Finally, in simulation experiments, it is shown that the decomposed
formulation has better efficiency and robustness to observation noises than
baseline parameterizations. And in real-world experiments, the proposed
back-end framework is demonstrated to be capable of building compact and
regularized maps.</span>

but human detecting of defects is often time-consuming, error-prone, and
unreliable, and is not scalable to large numbers of images or real-time
analysis. In this work, we discuss the application of machine learning
approaches to find the location and geometry of different defect clusters in
irradiated steels. We show that a deep learning based Faster R-CNN analysis
system has a performance comparable to human analysis with relatively small

when multiple features are present and paves the way for fast, scalable, and

                                        <span>The rise of personal assistants has made conversational question answering
(ConvQA) a very popular mechanism for user-system interaction. State-of-the-art
methods for ConvQA over knowledge graphs (KGs) can only learn from crisp
question-answer pairs found in popular benchmarks. In reality, however, such
training data is hard to come by: users would rarely mark answers explicitly as
correct or wrong. In this work, we take a step towards a more natural learning
paradigm - from noisy and implicit feedback via question reformulations. A
reformulation is likely to be triggered by an incorrect system response,
whereas a new follow-up question could be a positive signal on the previous
turn&#x27;s answer. We present a reinforcement learning model, termed CONQUER, that
can learn from a conversational stream of questions and reformulations. CONQUER
models the answering process as multiple agents walking in parallel on the KG,
where the walks are determined by actions sampled using a policy network. This
policy network takes the question along with the conversational context as
inputs and is trained via noisy rewards obtained from the reformulation
likelihood. To evaluate CONQUER, we create and release ConvRef, a benchmark
with about 11k natural conversations containing around 205k reformulations.
Experiments show that CONQUER successfully learns to answer conversational
questions from noisy reward signals, significantly improving over a
state-of-the-art baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have transformed the area of
semantic text matching. However, most of the state-of-the-art models are
designed to operate with short documents such as tweets, user reviews,
comments, etc., and have fundamental limitations when applied to long-form
documents such as scientific papers, legal documents, and patents. When
handling such long documents, there are three primary challenges: (i) The
presence of different contexts for the same word throughout the document, (ii)
Small sections of contextually similar text between two documents, but
dissimilar text in the remaining parts -- this defies the basic understanding
of &quot;similarity&quot;, and (iii) The coarse nature of a single global similarity
measure which fails to capture the heterogeneity of the document content. In
this paper, we describe CoLDE: Contrastive Long Document Encoder -- a
transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and allows for
interpretable comparisons of long documents. CoLDE uses unique positional
embeddings and a multi-headed chunkwise attention layer in conjunction with a
contrastive learning framework to capture similarity at three different levels:
(i) high-level similarity scores between a pair of documents, (ii) similarity
scores between different sections within and across documents, and (iii)
similarity scores between different chunks in the same document and also other
documents. These fine-grained similarity scores aid in better interpretability.
We evaluate CoLDE on three long document datasets namely, ACL Anthology
publications, Wikipedia articles, and USPTO patents. Besides outperforming the
state-of-the-art methods on the document comparison task, CoLDE also proves
interpretable and robust to changes in document length and text perturbations.</span>

                                        <span>Real-world recommendation systems often consist of two phases. In the first
phase, multiple predictive models produce the probability of different
immediate user actions. In the second phase, these predictions are aggregated
according to a set of &#x27;strategic parameters&#x27; to meet a diverse set of business
goals, such as longer user engagement, higher revenue potential, or more
community/network interactions. In addition to building accurate predictive
models, it is also crucial to optimize this set of &#x27;strategic parameters&#x27; so
that primary goals are optimized while secondary guardrails are not hurt. In
this setting with multiple and constrained goals, this paper discovers that a
probabilistic strategic parameter regime can achieve better value compared to
the standard regime of finding a single deterministic parameter. The new
probabilistic regime is to learn the best distribution over strategic parameter
choices and sample one strategic parameter from the distribution when each user
visits the platform. To pursue the optimal probabilistic solution, we formulate
the problem into a stochastic compositional optimization problem, in which the
unbiased stochastic gradient is unavailable. Our approach is applied in a
popular social network platform with hundreds of millions of daily users and
achieves +0.22% lift of user engagement in a recommendation task and +1.7% lift
in revenue in an advertising optimization scenario comparing to using the best
deterministic parameter strategy.</span>

                                        <span>This paper considers the problem of multi-server Private Linear Computation,
under the joint and individual privacy guarantees. In this problem, identical
copies of a dataset comprised of $K$ messages are stored on $N$ non-colluding
servers, and a user wishes to obtain one linear combination of a $D$-subset of
messages belonging to the dataset. The goal is to design a scheme for
performing the computation such that the total amount of information downloaded
from the servers is minimized, while the privacy of the $D$ messages required
for the computation is protected. When joint privacy is required, the
identities of all of these $D$ messages must be kept private jointly, and when
individual privacy is required, the identity of every one of these $D$ messages
must be kept private individually. In this work, we characterize the capacity,
which is defined as the maximum achievable download rate, under both joint and
individual privacy requirements. In particular, we show that the capacity is
given respectively by ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{K-D})^{-1}}$ or
${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{\lceil K/D\rceil-1})^{-1}}$ when joint or individual
privacy is required. Our converse proofs are based on reduction from two
variants of the multi-server Private Information Retrieval problem in the
presence of side information. Our achievability schemes build up on our
recently proposed schemes for single-server Private Linear Transformation and
the multi-server private computation scheme proposed by Sun and Jafar. Using
similar proof techniques, we also establish upper and lower bounds on the
capacity for the cases in which the user wants to compute $L$ (potentially more
than one) linear combinations. Specifically, we show that the capacity is upper
and lower bounded respectively by ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{(K-D)/L})^{-1}}$ and
${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{K-D+L-1})^{-1}}$, when joint privacy is required.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge about software used in scientific investigations is important for
several reasons, for instance, to enable an understanding of provenance and
methods involved in data handling. However, software is usually not formally
cited, but rather mentioned informally within the scholarly description of the
investigation, raising the need for automatic information extraction and
disambiguation. Given the lack of reliable ground truth data, we present
SoMeSci (Software Mentions in Science) a gold standard knowledge graph of
software mentions in scientific articles. It contains high quality annotations
(IRR: $\kappa{&#x3D;}.82$) of 3756 software mentions in 1367 PubMed Central
articles. Besides the plain mention of the software, we also provide relation
labels for additional information, such as the version, the developer, a URL or
citations. Moreover, we distinguish between different types, such as
application, plugin or programming environment, as well as different types of
mentions, such as usage or creation. To the best of our knowledge, SoMeSci is
the most comprehensive corpus about software mentions in scientific articles,
providing training samples for Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction,
Entity Disambiguation, and Entity Linking. Finally, we sketch potential use
cases and provide baseline results.</span>

                                        <span>News recommendation is often modeled as a sequential recommendation task,
which assumes that there are rich short-term dependencies over historical
clicked news. However, in news recommendation scenarios users usually have
strong preferences on the temporal diversity of news information and may not
tend to click similar news successively, which is very different from many
sequential recommendation scenarios such as e-commerce recommendation. In this
paper, we study whether news recommendation can be regarded as a standard
sequential recommendation problem. Through extensive experiments on two
real-world datasets, we find that modeling news recommendation as a sequential
recommendation problem is suboptimal. To handle this challenge, we further
propose a temporal diversity-aware news recommendation method that can promote
candidate news that are diverse from recently clicked news, which can help
predict future clicks more accurately. Experiments show that our approach can
consistently improve various news recommendation methods.</span>

publicly in the interest of open science. However, mechanisms are lacking to
reliably identify which pipelines and datasets can appropriately be used
together. Given the increasing number of high-quality public datasets and
pipelines, this lack of clear compatibility threatens the findability and
reusability of these resources. We investigate the feasibility of a
collaborative filtering system to recommend pipelines and datasets based on
provenance records from previous executions. We evaluate our system using
datasets and pipelines extracted from the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform,
a national initiative for open neuroscience. The recommendations provided by
our system (AUC$&#x3D;0.83$) are significantly better than chance and outperform
recommendations made by domain experts using their previous knowledge as well
as pipeline and dataset descriptions (AUC$&#x3D;0.63$). In particular, domain
experts often neglect low-level technical aspects of a pipeline-dataset
interaction, such as the level of pre-processing, which are captured by a
provenance-based system. We conclude that provenance-based pipeline and dataset
recommenders are feasible and beneficial to the sharing and usage of
open-science resources. Future work will focus on the collection of more
comprehensive provenance traces, and on deploying the system in production.</span>

                                        <span>Electronic Medical Records contain clinical narrative text that is of great
potential value to medical researchers. However, this information is mixed with
Personally Identifiable Information that presents risks to patient and
clinician confidentiality. This paper presents an end-to-end de-identification
framework to automatically remove PII from hospital discharge summaries. Our
corpus included 600 hospital discharge summaries which were extracted from the
EMRs of two principal referral hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Our end-to-end
de-identification framework consists of three components: 1) Annotation:
labelling of PII in the hospital discharge summaries using five pre-defined
categories: person, address, date of birth, individual identification number,
phone/fax number; 2) Modelling: training six named entity recognition deep
learning base-models on balanced and imbalanced datasets; and evaluating
ensembles that combine all six base-models, the three base-models with the best
F1 scores and the three base-models with the best recall scores respectively,
using token-level majority voting and stacking methods; and 3)
De-identification: removing PII from the hospital discharge summaries. Our
results showed that the ensemble model combined using the stacking Support
Vector Machine method on the three base-models with the best F1 scores achieved
excellent results with a F1 score of 99.16% on the test set of our corpus. We
also evaluated the robustness of our modelling component on the 2014 i2b2
de-identification dataset. Our ensemble model, which uses the token-level
majority voting method on all six base-models, achieved the highest F1 score of
96.24% at strict entity matching and the highest F1 score of 98.64% at binary
token-level matching compared to two state-of-the-art methods. The end-to-end
framework provides a robust solution to de-identifying clinical narrative
corpuses safely.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender system plays a crucial role in modern E-commerce platform. Due to
the lack of historical interactions between users and items, cold-start
recommendation is a challenging problem. In order to alleviate the cold-start
issue, most existing methods introduce content and contextual information as
the auxiliary information. Nevertheless, these methods assume the recommended
items behave steadily over time, while in a typical E-commerce scenario, items
generally have very different performances throughout their life period. In
such a situation, it would be beneficial to consider the long-term return from
the item perspective, which is usually ignored in conventional methods.
Reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits such a long-term optimization
problem, in which the recommender could identify high potential items,
proactively allocate more user impressions to boost their growth, therefore
improve the multi-period cumulative gains. Inspired by this idea, we model the
process as a Partially Observable and Controllable Markov Decision Process
(POC-MDP), and propose an actor-critic RL framework (RL-LTV) to incorporate the
item lifetime values (LTV) into the recommendation. In RL-LTV, the critic
studies historical trajectories of items and predict the future LTV of fresh
item, while the actor suggests a score-based policy which maximizes the future
LTV expectation. Scores suggested by the actor are then combined with classical
ranking scores in a dual-rank framework, therefore the recommendation is
balanced with the LTV consideration. Our method outperforms the strong live
baseline with a relative improvement of 8.67% and 18.03% on IPV and GMV of
cold-start items, on one of the largest E-commerce platform.</span>

                                        <span>Predicting accurate future trajectories of multiple agents is essential for
autonomous systems, but is challenging due to the complex agent interaction and
the uncertainty in each agent&#x27;s future behavior. Forecasting multi-agent
trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we
model the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social
dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most
prior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., first using a
temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and
then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model.
This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the
time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would
prefer a method that allows an agent&#x27;s state at one time to directly affect
another agent&#x27;s state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new
Transformer, AgentFormer, that jointly models the time and social dimensions.
The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by
flattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention
operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence,
AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent
identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements
of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent
trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any
previous timestep when inferring an agent&#x27;s future position. The latent intent
of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one
agent&#x27;s behavior to affect other agents. Our method significantly improves the
state of the art on well-established pedestrian and autonomous driving
datasets.</span>

vulnerable to a variety of privacy attacks, including membership inference
attacks, that lead to violations of regulations governing the use of medical
data and threaten to compromise their effective deployment in the clinic. In
contrast to most recent work in privacy-aware ML that has been focused on model
alteration and post-processing steps, we propose here a novel and complementary
scheme that enhances the security of medical data by controlling the data
sharing process. We develop and evaluate a privacy defense protocol based on
using a generative adversarial network (GAN) that allows a medical data sourcer
(e.g. a hospital) to provide an external agent (a modeler) a proxy dataset
synthesized from the original images, so that the resulting diagnostic systems
made available to model consumers is rendered resilient to privacy attackers.
We validate the proposed method on retinal diagnostics AI used for diabetic
retinopathy that bears the risk of possibly leaking private information. To
incorporate concerns of both privacy advocates and modelers, we introduce a
metric to evaluate privacy and utility performance in combination, and
demonstrate, using these novel and classical metrics, that our approach, by
itself or in conjunction with other defenses, provides state of the art (SOTA)
performance for defending against privacy attacks.</span>

performed in a distributed fashion in the presence of adversarial workers. We
propose techniques to break the adversarial toleration threshold barrier
previously known in coded computing. More specifically, we leverage
list-decoding techniques for folded Reed-Solomon codes and propose novel
algorithms to recover the correct codeword using side information. In the coded
computing setting, we show how the master node can perform certain carefully
designed extra computations to obtain the side information. The workload of
computing this side information is negligible compared to the computations done
by each worker. This side information is then utilized to prune the output of
the list decoder and uniquely recover the true outcome. We further propose
folded Lagrange coded computing (FLCC) to incorporate the developed techniques
into a specific coded computing setting. Our results show that FLCC outperforms
LCC by breaking the barrier on the number of adversaries that can be tolerated.
In particular, the corresponding threshold in FLCC is improved by a factor of
two asymptotically compared to that of LCC.</span>

trained with supervision, assuming the availability of clean videos. However,
in many applications, such as microscopy, noiseless videos are not available.
To address this, we propose an Unsupervised Deep Video Denoiser (UDVD), a CNN
architecture designed to be trained exclusively with noisy data. The
performance of UDVD is comparable to the supervised state-of-the-art, even when
trained only on a single short noisy video. We demonstrate the promise of our
approach in real-world imaging applications by denoising raw video,
fluorescence-microscopy and electron-microscopy data. In contrast to many
current approaches to video denoising, UDVD does not require explicit motion
compensation. This is advantageous because motion compensation is
computationally expensive, and can be unreliable when the input data are noisy.
A gradient-based analysis reveals that UDVD automatically adapts to local
motion in the input noisy videos. Thus, the network learns to perform implicit
motion compensation, even though it is only trained for denoising.</span>

as smartphones and fitness watches. As a result, the array of health-related
research and applications that tap onto this data has been growing, but little
attention has been devoted to the prediction of an individual&#x27;s heart rate (HR)
from IMU data, when undergoing a physical activity. Would that be even
possible? If so, this could be used to design personalized sets of aerobic
exercises, for instance. In this work, we show that it is viable to obtain
accurate HR predictions from IMU data using Recurrent Neural Networks, provided
only access to HR and IMU data from a short-lived, previously executed
activity. We propose a novel method for initializing an RNN&#x27;s hidden state
vectors, using a specialized network that attempts to extract an embedding of
the physical conditioning (PCE) of a subject. We show that using a
discriminator in the training phase to help the model learn whether two PCEs
belong to the same individual further reduces the prediction error. We evaluate
the proposed model when predicting the HR of 23 subjects performing a variety
of physical activities from IMU data available in public datasets (PAMAP2,
PPG-DaLiA). For comparison, we use as baselines the only model specifically
proposed for this task and an adapted state-of-the-art model for Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a closely related task. Our method, PCE-LSTM, yields over
10% lower mean absolute error. We demonstrate empirically that this error
reduction is in part due to the use of the PCE. Last, we use the two datasets
(PPG-DaLiA, WESAD) to show that PCE-LSTM can also be successfully applied when
photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors are available, outperforming the
state-of-the-art deep learning baselines by more than 30%.</span>

years, state-of-the-art models are often still limited by the size of state and
action spaces. Model-free reinforcement learning approaches use some form of
state representations and the latest work has explored embedding techniques for
actions, both with the aim of achieving better generalization and
applicability. However, these approaches consider only states or actions,
ignoring the interaction between them when generating embedded representations.
In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for the validity of
training a reinforcement learning agent using embedded states and actions. We
then propose a new approach for jointly learning embeddings for states and
actions that combines aspects of model-free and model-based reinforcement
learning, which can be applied in both discrete and continuous domains.
Specifically, we use a model of the environment to obtain embeddings for states
and actions and present a generic architecture that leverages these to learn a
policy. In this way, the embedded representations obtained via our approach
enable better generalization over both states and actions by capturing
similarities in the embedding spaces. Evaluations of our approach on several
gaming, robotic control, and recommender systems show it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both discrete/continuous domains with
large state/action spaces, thus confirming its efficacy.</span>

classification problems in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In the
traditional analysis using a consistency property of loss functions, it is
known that the expected classification error converges more slowly than the
expected risk even when assuming a low-noise condition on the conditional label
probabilities. Consequently, the resulting rate is sublinear. Therefore, it is
important to consider whether much faster convergence of the expected
classification error can be achieved. In recent research, an exponential
convergence rate for stochastic gradient descent was shown under a strong
low-noise condition but provided theoretical analysis was limited to the
squared loss function, which is somewhat inadequate for binary classification
tasks. In this paper, we show an exponential convergence of the expected
classification error in the final phase of the stochastic gradient descent for
a wide class of differentiable convex loss functions under similar assumptions.
As for the averaged stochastic gradient descent, we show that the same
convergence rate holds from the early phase of training. In experiments, we
verify our analyses on the $L_2$-regularized logistic regression.</span>

intelligent augmentation to address bias-causing data imbalance, by using
generative models that allow the fine control of sensitive factors related to
underrepresented populations via domain adaptation and latent space
manipulation. When testing our methods on image analytics, experiments
demonstrate that TARA significantly or fully debiases baseline models while
outperforming competing debiasing methods that have the same amount of
information, e.g., with (% overall accuracy, % accuracy gap) &#x3D; (78.8, 0.5) vs.
the baseline method&#x27;s score of (71.8, 10.5) for EyePACS, and (73.7, 11.8) vs.
(69.1, 21.7) for CelebA. Furthermore, recognizing certain limitations in
current metrics used for assessing debiasing performance, we propose novel
conjunctive debiasing metrics. Our experiments also demonstrate the ability of
these novel metrics in assessing the Pareto efficiency of the proposed methods.</span>

                                        <span>Variational approximation, such as mean-field (MF) and tree-reweighted (TRW),
provide a computationally efficient approximation of the log-partition function
for a generic graphical model. TRW provably provides an upper bound, but the
approximation ratio is generally not quantified.

As the primary contribution of this work, we provide an approach to quantify
the approximation ratio through the property of the underlying graph structure.
Specifically, we argue that (a variant of) TRW produces an estimate that is
within factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa(G)}}$ of the true log-partition function
for any discrete pairwise graphical model over graph $G$, where $\kappa(G) \in
(0,1]$ captures how far $G$ is from tree structure with $\kappa(G) &#x3D; 1$ for
trees and $2/N$ for the complete graph over $N$ vertices. As a consequence, the
approximation ratio is $1$ for trees, $\sqrt{(d+1)/2}$ for any graph with
maximum average degree $d$, and $\stackrel{\beta\to\infty}{\approx}
1+1/(2\beta)$ for graphs with girth (shortest cycle) at least $\beta \log N$.
In general, $\kappa(G)$ is the solution of a max-min problem associated with
$G$ that can be evaluated in polynomial time for any graph.

Using samples from the uniform distribution over the spanning trees of G, we
provide a near linear-time variant that achieves an approximation ratio equal
to the inverse of square-root of minimal (across edges) effective resistance of
the graph. We connect our results to the graph partition-based approximation
method and thus provide a unified perspective.

                                        <span>Recent work has shown that the performance of machine learning models can
vary substantially when models are evaluated on data drawn from a distribution
that is close to but different from the training distribution. As a result,
predicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge.
Our work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty
literature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen
distributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution
shift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve
their performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms
of predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through
investigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as
Frechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to
induce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other
hand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier&#x27;s
predictions successfully estimates the classifier&#x27;s performance change over a
variety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between
synthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its
simplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional
difference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\%$) on several
realistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust
and ImageNet-Rendition datasets.</span>

verification of factual claims. Nevertheless, the majority of existing research
into this task has focused on textual data, and the few recent inquiries into
structured data have been for the closed-domain setting where appropriate
evidence for each claim is assumed to have already been retrieved. In this
paper, we investigate verification over structured data in the open-domain
setting, introducing a joint reranking-and-verification model which fuses
evidence documents in the verification component. Our open-domain model
achieves performance comparable to the closed-domain state-of-the-art on the
TabFact dataset, and demonstrates performance gains from the inclusion of
multiple tables as well as a significant improvement over a heuristic retrieval

                                        <span>Learning socially-aware motion representations is at the core of recent
advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot
navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representations
learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop
predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises
from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with
ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes
from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from &quot;positive&quot; examples, it is
difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of &quot;negative&quot; examples
like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly
modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social
contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by
discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii)
we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare
but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision
rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement
learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several
benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-nce.</span>

perturbations in the input, called adversarial examples, that result in
misclassification. Generating adversarial examples for source code poses an
additional challenge compared to the domains of images and natural language,
because source code perturbations must retain the functional meaning of the
code. We identify a striking relationship between token frequency statistics
and learned token embeddings: the L2 norm of learned token embeddings increases
with the frequency of the token except for the highest-frequnecy tokens. We
leverage this relationship to construct a simple and efficient gradient-free
method for generating state-of-the-art adversarial examples on models of code.

that encode their local neighborhoods but not their positions. Consequently,
two nodes that are vastly distant but located in similar local neighborhoods
map to similar embeddings in those networks. This limitation prevents accurate
performance in predictive tasks that rely on position information. In this
paper, we develop GraphReach, a position-aware inductive GNN that captures the
global positions of nodes through reachability estimations with respect to a
set of anchor nodes. The anchors are strategically selected so that
reachability estimations across all the nodes are maximized. We show that this
combinatorial anchor selection problem is NP-hard and, consequently, develop a
greedy (1-1/e) approximation heuristic. Empirical evaluation against
state-of-the-art GNN architectures reveal that GraphReach provides up to 40%
relative improvement in accuracy. In addition, it is more robust to adversarial
attacks.</span>

persons only interact at specific points in time. This information directs
dissemination processes on the network, such as the spread of rumors, fake
news, or diseases. However, the current state-of-the-art methods for supervised
graph classification are designed mainly for static graphs and may not be able
to capture temporal information. Hence, they are not powerful enough to
distinguish between graphs modeling different dissemination processes. To
address this, we introduce a framework to lift standard graph kernels to the
temporal domain. Specifically, we explore three different approaches and
investigate the trade-offs between loss of temporal information and efficiency.
Moreover, to handle large-scale graphs, we propose stochastic variants of our
kernels with provable approximation guarantees. We evaluate our methods on a
wide range of real-world social networks. Our methods beat static kernels by a
large margin in terms of accuracy while still being scalable to large graphs
and data sets. Hence, we confirm that taking temporal information into account
is crucial for the successful classification of dissemination processes.</span>

                                        <span>Existing calibration algorithms address the problem of covariate shift via
unsupervised domain adaptation. However, these methods suffer from the
following limitations: 1) they require unlabeled data from the target domain,
which may not be available at the stage of calibration in real-world
applications and 2) their performance depends heavily on the disparity between
the distributions of the source and target domains. To address these two
limitations, we present novel calibration solutions via domain generalization.
Our core idea is to leverage multiple calibration domains to reduce the
effective distribution disparity between the target and calibration domains for
improved calibration transfer without needing any data from the target domain.
We provide theoretical justification and empirical experimental results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Compared against
state-of-the-art calibration methods designed for domain adaptation, we observe
a decrease of 8.86 percentage points in expected calibration error or,
equivalently, an increase of 35 percentage points in improvement ratio for
multi-class classification on the Office-Home dataset.</span>

given a passage. It has been widely studied recently, especially in open
domains. However, few efforts have been made on closed-domain MRC, mainly due
to the lack of large-scale training data. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-target MRC task for the medical domain, whose goal is to predict answers
to medical questions and the corresponding support sentences from medical
information sources simultaneously, in order to ensure the high reliability of
medical knowledge serving. A high-quality dataset is manually constructed for
the purpose, named Multi-task Chinese Medical MRC dataset (CMedMRC), with
detailed analysis conducted. We further propose the Chinese medical BERT model
for the task (CMedBERT), which fuses medical knowledge into pre-trained
language models by the dynamic fusion mechanism of heterogeneous features and
the multi-task learning strategy. Experiments show that CMedBERT consistently
outperforms strong baselines by fusing context-aware and knowledge-aware token
representations.</span>

image-level (i.e. input-output pairs) or set-level (i.e. domain labels)
supervision. However, even set-level supervision can be a severe bottleneck for
data collection in practice. In this paper, we tackle image-to-image
translation in a fully unsupervised setting, i.e., neither paired images nor
domain labels. To this end, we propose a truly unsupervised image-to-image

and translates input images into the estimated domains. Experimental results
show that our model achieves comparable or even better performance than the
set-level supervised model trained with full labels, generalizes well on
various datasets, and is robust against the choice of hyperparameters (e.g. the
preset number of pseudo domains). Furthermore, TUNIT can be easily extended to
semi-supervised learning with a few labeled data.</span>

                                        <span>Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted much attention with the
prevalence of accessible depth sensors. Recently, graph convolutional networks
(GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to
model graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for
modeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly
focus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is
learned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer
of the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple
sets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The
reason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and
conventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights
into GCNs. To overcome this gap, we reinvent the split-transform-merge strategy
in GCNs for skeleton sequence processing. Specifically, we design a simple and
highly modularized graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based
action recognition. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block
that aggregates multi-granularity information from both the spatial and
temporal paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin with only 1/5 of the
parameters and 1/10 of the FLOPs. Code is available at

reactants to synthesize a target molecule, a.k.a. retrosynthesis prediction.
Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on matching the target molecule with a
large set of reaction templates, which are very computationally expensive and
also suffer from the problem of coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel
template-free approach called G2Gs by transforming a target molecular graph
into a set of reactant molecular graphs. G2Gs first splits the target molecular
graph into a set of synthons by identifying the reaction centers, and then
translates the synthons to the final reactant graphs via a variational graph
translation framework. Experimental results show that G2Gs significantly
outperforms existing template-free approaches by up to 63% in terms of the
top-1 accuracy and achieves a performance close to that of state-of-the-art
template based approaches, but does not require domain knowledge and is much
more scalable.</span>

                                        <span>A random dot product graph (RDPG) is a generative model for networks in which
vertices correspond to positions in a latent Euclidean space and edge
probabilities are determined by the dot products of the latent positions. We
consider RDPGs for which the latent positions are randomly sampled from an
unknown $1$-dimensional submanifold of the latent space. In principle,
restricted inference, i.e., procedures that exploit the structure of the
submanifold, should be more effective than unrestricted inference; however, it
is not clear how to conduct restricted inference when the submanifold is
unknown. We submit that techniques for manifold learning can be used to learn
the unknown submanifold well enough to realize benefit from restricted
inference. To illustrate, we test $1$- and $2$-sample hypotheses about the
Fr\&#x27;{e}chet means of small communities of vertices, using the complete set of
vertices to infer latent structure. We propose test statistics that deploy the
Isomap procedure for manifold learning, using shortest path distances on
neighborhood graphs constructed from estimated latent positions to estimate arc
lengths on the unknown $1$-dimensional submanifold. Unlike conventional
applications of Isomap, the estimated latent positions do not lie on the
submanifold of interest. We extend existing convergence results for Isomap to
this setting and use them to demonstrate that, as the number of auxiliary
vertices increases, the power of our test converges to the power of the
corresponding test when the submanifold is known. Finally, we apply our methods
to an inference problem that arises in studying the connectome of the
Drosophila larval mushroom body. The univariate learnt manifold test rejects
($p&lt;0.05$), while the multivariate ambient space test does not ($p\gg0.05$),
illustrating the value of identifying and exploiting low-dimensional structure
for subsequent inference.</span>

publicly in the interest of open science. However, mechanisms are lacking to
reliably identify which pipelines and datasets can appropriately be used
together. Given the increasing number of high-quality public datasets and
pipelines, this lack of clear compatibility threatens the findability and
reusability of these resources. We investigate the feasibility of a
collaborative filtering system to recommend pipelines and datasets based on
provenance records from previous executions. We evaluate our system using
datasets and pipelines extracted from the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform,
a national initiative for open neuroscience. The recommendations provided by
our system (AUC$&#x3D;0.83$) are significantly better than chance and outperform
recommendations made by domain experts using their previous knowledge as well
as pipeline and dataset descriptions (AUC$&#x3D;0.63$). In particular, domain
experts often neglect low-level technical aspects of a pipeline-dataset
interaction, such as the level of pre-processing, which are captured by a
provenance-based system. We conclude that provenance-based pipeline and dataset
recommenders are feasible and beneficial to the sharing and usage of
open-science resources. Future work will focus on the collection of more

                                        <span>Singing Voice Detection (SVD) has been an active area of research in music
information retrieval (MIR). Currently, two deep neural network-based methods,
one based on CNN and the other on RNN, exist in literature that learn optimized
features for the voice detection (VD) task and achieve state-of-the-art
performance on common datasets. Both these models have a huge number of
parameters (1.4M for CNN and 65.7K for RNN) and hence not suitable for
deployment on devices like smartphones or embedded sensors with limited
capacity in terms of memory and computation power. The most popular method to
address this issue is known as knowledge distillation in deep learning
literature (in addition to model compression) where a large pre-trained network
known as the teacher is used to train a smaller student network. Given the wide
applications of SVD in music information retrieval, to the best of our
knowledge, model compression for practical deployment has not yet been
explored. In this paper, efforts have been made to investigate this issue using
both conventional as well as ensemble knowledge distillation techniques.</span>

available, each capturing a distinct subset of variables. While problem
formulations typically take the data as given, in practice, data acquisition
can be an ongoing process. In this paper, we aim to estimate any functional of
a probabilistic model (e.g., a causal effect) as efficiently as possible, by
deciding, at each time, which data source to query. We propose online moment
selection (OMS), a framework in which structural assumptions are encoded as
moment conditions. The optimal action at each step depends, in part, on the
very moments that identify the functional of interest. Our algorithms balance
exploration with choosing the best action as suggested by current estimates of
the moments. We propose two selection strategies: (1) explore-then-commit
(OMS-ETC) and (2) explore-then-greedy (OMS-ETG), proving that both achieve zero
asymptotic regret as assessed by MSE. We instantiate our setup for average
treatment effect estimation, where structural assumptions are given by a causal
graph and data sources may include subsets of mediators, confounders, and
instrumental variables.</span>

stochastic optimization, which dynamically incorporates the curvature of the
loss function by approximating the Hessian via a diagonal matrix. Importantly,
the update and storage of the diagonal approximation of Hessian is as efficient
as adaptive first-order optimization methods with linear complexity for both
time and memory. To handle nonconvexity, we replace the Hessian with its
rectified absolute value, which is guaranteed to be positive-definite.
Experiments on three tasks of vision and language show that Apollo achieves
significant improvements over other stochastic optimization methods, including
SGD and variants of Adam, in term of both convergence speed and generalization
performance. The implementation of the algorithm is available at

play a matrix game against each other and update their parameters after each
round. The agents&#x27; decision-making is transparent to each other, which allows
each agent to predict how their opponent will play against them. To prevent an
infinite regress of both agents recursively predicting each other indefinitely,
each agent is required to give an opponent-independent response with some
probability at least epsilon. Transparency also allows each agent to anticipate
and shape the other agent&#x27;s gradient step, i.e. to move to regions of parameter
space in which the opponent&#x27;s gradient points in a direction favourable to
them. We study the resulting dynamics experimentally, using two algorithms from
previous literature (LOLA and SOS) for opponent-aware learning. We find that
the combination of mutually transparent decision-making and opponent-aware
learning robustly leads to mutual cooperation in a single-shot prisoner&#x27;s
dilemma. In a game of chicken, in which both agents try to manoeuvre their
opponent towards their preferred equilibrium, converging to a mutually
beneficial outcome turns out to be much harder, and opponent-aware learning can
even lead to worst-case outcomes for both agents. This highlights the need to
develop opponent-aware learning algorithms that achieve acceptable outcomes in
social dilemmas involving an equilibrium selection problem.</span>

                                        <span>Currently, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is experiencing a globally increasing
incidence and high cost to health systems. A delayed recognition implies
premature mortality due to progressive loss of kidney function. The employment
of data mining to discover subtle patterns in CKD indicators would contribute
achieving early diagnosis. This work presents the development and evaluation of
an explainable prediction model that would support clinicians in the early
diagnosis of CKD patients. The model development is based on a data management
pipeline that detects the best combination of ensemble trees algorithms and
features selected concerning classification performance. The results obtained
through the pipeline equals the performance of the best CKD prediction models
identified in the literature. Furthermore, the main contribution of the paper
involves an explainability-driven approach that allows selecting the best
prediction model maintaining a balance between accuracy and explainability.
Therefore, the most balanced explainable prediction model of CKD implements an
XGBoost classifier over a group of 4 features (packed cell value, specific
gravity, albumin, and hypertension), achieving an accuracy of 98.9% and 97.5%
with cross-validation technique and with new unseen data respectively. In
addition, by analysing the model&#x27;s explainability by means of different
post-hoc techniques, the packed cell value and the specific gravity are
determined as the most relevant features that influence the prediction results
of the model. This small number of feature selected results in a reduced cost
of the early diagnosis of CKD implying a promising solution for developing
countries.</span>

like Beijing and Hong Kong. Due to its important role and complex nature, it is
always in great need for public agencies to better understand the performance
of the URT system. This paper focuses on an essential and hard problem to
estimate the network-wide link travel time and station waiting time using the
automatic fare collection (AFC) data in the URT system, which is beneficial to
better understand the system-wide real-time operation state. The emerging
data-driven techniques, such as computational graph (CG) models in the machine
learning field, provide a new solution for solving this problem. In this study,
we first formulate a data-driven estimation optimization framework to estimate
the link travel time and station waiting time. Then, we cast the estimation
optimization model into a CG framework to solve the optimization problem and
obtain the estimation results. The methodology is verified on a synthetic URT
network and applied to a real-world URT network using the synthetic and
real-world AFC data, respectively. Results show the robustness and
effectiveness of the CG-based framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that the CG is applied to the URT. This study can provide
critical insights to better understand the operational state in URT.</span>

                                        <span>Building domain-specific accelerators for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) is challenging due to a lack of systematic methodology for designing
onboard compute. Balancing a computing system for a UAV requires considering
both the cyber (e.g., sensor rate, compute performance) and physical (e.g.,
payload weight) characteristics that affect overall performance. Iterating over
the many component choices results in a combinatorial explosion of the number
of possible combinations: from 10s of thousands to billions, depending on
implementation details. Manually selecting combinations of these components is
tedious and expensive. To navigate the {cyber-physical design space}
efficiently, we introduce \emph{AutoPilot}, a framework that automates
full-system UAV co-design. AutoPilot uses Bayesian optimization to navigate a
large design space and automatically select a combination of autonomy algorithm
and hardware accelerator while considering the cross-product effect of other
cyber and physical UAV components. We show that the AutoPilot methodology
consistently outperforms general-purpose hardware selections like Xavier NX and
Jetson TX2, as well as dedicated hardware accelerators built for autonomous
UAVs, across a range of representative scenarios (three different UAV types and
three deployment environments). Designs generated by AutoPilot increase the
number of missions on average by up to 2.25x, 1.62x, and 1.43x for nano, micro,
and mini-UAVs respectively over baselines. Our work demonstrates the need for
holistic full-UAV co-design to achieve maximum overall UAV performance and the
need for automated flows to simplify the design process for autonomous
cyber-physical systems.</span>

                                        <span>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are frequently used for
tasks involving time-sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is
difficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and
low latency because the fully connected structure makes LSTM networks a
memory-bounded algorithm. Previous LSTM accelerators either exploited weight
spatial sparsity or temporal activation sparsity. This paper proposes a new
accelerator called &quot;Spartus&quot; that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve
ultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity is induced using our proposed
pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD), which structures
sparse weight matrices for balanced workload. It achieved up to 96% weight
sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an LSTM network trained on a
TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal sparsity in LSTM, we create
the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU method to the LSTM network.
This combined sparsity simultaneously saves on the weight memory access and
associated arithmetic operations. Spartus was implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100
FPGA. The Spartus per-sample latency for a single DeltaLSTM layer of 1024
neurons averages 1 us. Spartus achieved 9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput
and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which, respectively, are 4X and 7X higher than
the previous state-of-the-art.</span>

distribution. Compared to conventional imbalance learning problems, the
classification of imbalanced time-series data is more challenging due to high
dimensionality and high inter-variable correlation. This paper proposes a
structure preserving Oversampling method to combat the High-dimensional
Imbalanced Time-series classification (OHIT). OHIT first leverages a
density-ratio based shared nearest neighbor clustering algorithm to capture the
modes of minority class in high-dimensional space. It then for each mode
applies the shrinkage technique of large-dimensional covariance matrix to
obtain accurate and reliable covariance structure. Finally, OHIT generates the
structure-preserving synthetic samples based on multivariate Gaussian
distribution by using the estimated covariance matrices. Experimental results
on several publicly available time-series datasets (including unimodal and
multimodal) demonstrate the superiority of OHIT against the state-of-the-art
oversampling algorithms in terms of F1, G-mean, and AUC.</span>

problem, that is, which characteristics make an instance hard to solve? To do
so, we carry out an instance space analysis for the car sequencing problem, by
extracting a vector of problem features to characterize an instance. In order
to visualize the instance space, the feature vectors are projected onto a
two-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction techniques. The resulting
two-dimensional visualizations provide new insights into the characteristics of
the instances used for testing and how these characteristics influence the
behaviours of an optimization algorithm. This analysis guides us in
constructing a new set of benchmark instances with a range of instance
properties. We demonstrate that these new instances are more diverse than the
previous benchmarks, including some instances that are significantly more
difficult to solve. We introduce two new algorithms for solving the car
sequencing problem and compare them with four existing methods from the
literature. Our new algorithms are shown to perform competitively for this
problem but no single algorithm can outperform all others over all instances.
This observation motivates us to build an algorithm selection model based on
machine learning, to identify the niche in the instance space that an algorithm
is expected to perform well on. Our analysis helps to understand problem
hardness and select an appropriate algorithm for solving a given car sequencing
problem instance.</span>

task learning to the Contrastive learning. But contrastive methods have some
drawbacks which could not be solved completely, such as performing poor on
fine-grained visual tasks compare to supervised learning methods. In this
study, at first, the impact of ImageNet pre-training on fine-grained Facial
Expression Recognition (FER) was tested. It could be seen from the results that
training from scratch is better than ImageNet fine-tuning at stronger
augmentation levels. After that, a framework was proposed for standard
Supervised Learning (SL), called Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) which merged
Self-Supervised as auxiliary task to the SL training setting. Leveraging
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) can gain additional information from input data
than labels which can help the main fine-grained SL task. It is been
investigated how this method could be used for FER by designing two customized
version of common pre-text techniques, Jigsaw puzzling and in-painting. The
state-of-the-art was reached on AffectNet via two types of HMTL, without
utilizing pre-training on additional datasets. Moreover, we showed the
difference between SS pre-training and HMTL to demonstrate superiority of
proposed method. Furthermore, the impact of proposed method was shown on two
other fine-grained facial tasks, Head Poses estimation and Gender Recognition,

as it facilitates many downstream network analytics tasks. For large networks,
the trained embeddings often require a significant amount of space to store,
making storage and processing a challenge. Building on our previous work on
semi-supervised network embedding, we develop d-SNEQ, a differentiable
DNN-based quantisation method for network embedding. d-SNEQ incorporates a rank
loss to equip the learned quantisation codes with rich high-order information
and is able to substantially compress the size of trained embeddings, thus
reducing storage footprint and accelerating retrieval speed. We also propose a
new evaluation metric, path prediction, to fairly and more directly evaluate
model performance on the preservation of high-order information. Our evaluation
on four real-world networks of diverse characteristics shows that d-SNEQ
outperforms a number of state-of-the-art embedding methods in link prediction,
path prediction, node classification, and node recommendation while being far
more space- and time-efficient.</span>

and expensive to evaluate objective function $f$. The problem can be cast as a
Gaussian Process (GP) bandit where $f$ lives in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). The state of the art analysis of several learning algorithms
shows a significant gap between the lower and upper bounds on the simple regret
performance. When $N$ is the number of exploration trials and $\gamma_N$ is the
maximal information gain, we prove an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_N/N})$
bound on the simple regret performance of a pure exploration algorithm that is
significantly tighter than the existing bounds. We show that this bound is
order optimal up to logarithmic factors for the cases where a lower bound on
regret is known. To establish these results, we prove novel and sharp
confidence intervals for GP models applicable to RKHS elements which may be of
broader interest.</span>

                                        <span>The intrusion detection system (IDS) is an essential element of security
monitoring in computer networks. An IDS distinguishes the malicious traffic
from the benign one and determines the attack types targeting the assets of the
organization. The main challenge of an IDS is facing new (i.e., zero-day)
attacks and separating them from benign traffic and existing types of attacks.
Along with the power of the deep learning-based IDSes in auto-extracting
high-level features and its independence from the time-consuming and costly
signature extraction process, the mentioned challenge still exists in this new
generation of IDSes.

In this paper, we propose a framework for deep learning-based IDSes
addressing new attacks. This framework is the first approach using both deep
novelty-based classifiers besides the traditional clustering based on the
specialized layer of deep structures, in the security scope. Additionally, we
introduce DOC++ as a newer version of DOC as a deep novelty-based classifier.
We also employ the Deep Intrusion Detection (DID) framework for the
preprocessing phase, which improves the ability of deep learning algorithms to
detect content-based attacks. We compare four different algorithms (including
DOC, DOC++, OpenMax, and AutoSVM) as the novelty classifier of the framework
and use both the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets for the evaluation.
Our results show that DOC++ is the best implementation of the open set
recognition module. Besides, the completeness and homogeneity of the clustering
and post-training phase prove that this model is good enough for the supervised
labeling and updating phase.</span>

(Cyber-Physical Systems) technologies, big spatiotemporal data are being
generated from mobile phones, car navigation systems, and traffic sensors. By
leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning technologies on such data, urban
traffic prediction has drawn a lot of attention in AI and Intelligent
Transportation System community. The problem can be uniformly modeled with a 3D
tensor (T, N, C), where T denotes the total time steps, N denotes the size of
the spatial domain (i.e., mesh-grids or graph-nodes), and C denotes the
channels of information. According to the specific modeling strategy, the
state-of-the-art deep learning models can be divided into three categories:
grid-based, graph-based, and multivariate time-series models. In this study, we
first synthetically review the deep traffic models as well as the widely used
datasets, then build a standard benchmark to comprehensively evaluate their
performances with the same settings and metrics. Our study named DL-Traff is

                                        <span>Recently, some works found an interesting phenomenon that adversarially
robust classifiers can generate good images comparable to generative models. We
investigate this phenomenon from an energy perspective and provide a novel
explanation. We reformulate adversarial example generation, adversarial
training, and image generation in terms of an energy function. We find that
adversarial training contributes to obtaining an energy function that is flat
and has low energy around the real data, which is the key for generative
capability. Based on our new understanding, we further propose a better
adversarial training method, Joint Energy Adversarial Training (JEAT), which
can generate high-quality images and achieve new state-of-the-art robustness
under a wide range of attacks. The Inception Score of the images (CIFAR-10)
generated by JEAT is 8.80, much better than original robust classifiers (7.50).
In particular, we achieve new state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 (from
57.20% to 62.04%) and CIFAR-100 (from 30.03% to 30.18%) without extra training
data.</span>

most details with only contour reserved, e.g. cartoon. However, in terms of
visual perception of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the ability for recognizing
abstract objects (visual objects with lost information) is still a challenge.
In this work, we investigate this issue from an adversarial viewpoint: will the
performance of DNNs decrease even for the images only losing a little
information? Towards this end, we propose a novel adversarial attack, named
\textit{AdvDrop}, which crafts adversarial examples by dropping existing
information of images. Previously, most adversarial attacks add extra
disturbing information on clean images explicitly. Opposite to previous works,
our proposed work explores the adversarial robustness of DNN models in a novel
perspective by dropping imperceptible details to craft adversarial examples. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{AdvDrop} by extensive experiments, and
show that this new type of adversarial examples is more difficult to be
defended by current defense systems.</span>

                                        <span>Real-world recommendation systems often consist of two phases. In the first
phase, multiple predictive models produce the probability of different
immediate user actions. In the second phase, these predictions are aggregated
according to a set of &#x27;strategic parameters&#x27; to meet a diverse set of business
goals, such as longer user engagement, higher revenue potential, or more
community/network interactions. In addition to building accurate predictive
models, it is also crucial to optimize this set of &#x27;strategic parameters&#x27; so
that primary goals are optimized while secondary guardrails are not hurt. In
this setting with multiple and constrained goals, this paper discovers that a
probabilistic strategic parameter regime can achieve better value compared to
the standard regime of finding a single deterministic parameter. The new
probabilistic regime is to learn the best distribution over strategic parameter
choices and sample one strategic parameter from the distribution when each user
visits the platform. To pursue the optimal probabilistic solution, we formulate
the problem into a stochastic compositional optimization problem, in which the
unbiased stochastic gradient is unavailable. Our approach is applied in a
popular social network platform with hundreds of millions of daily users and
achieves +0.22% lift of user engagement in a recommendation task and +1.7% lift
in revenue in an advertising optimization scenario comparing to using the best
deterministic parameter strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Implementing federated learning (FL) algorithms in wireless networks has
garnered a wide range of attention. However, few works have considered the
impact of user mobility on the learning performance. To fill this research gap,
firstly, we develop a theoretical model to characterize the hierarchical
federated learning (HFL) algorithm in wireless networks where the mobile users
may roam across multiple edge access points, leading to incompletion of
inconsistent FL training. Secondly, we provide the convergence analysis of HFL
with user mobility. Our analysis proves that the learning performance of HFL
deteriorates drastically with highly-mobile users. And this decline in the
learning performance will be exacerbated with small number of participants and
large data distribution divergences among local data of users. To circumvent
these issues, we propose a mobility-aware cluster federated learning (MACFL)
algorithm by redesigning the access mechanism, local update rule and model
aggregation scheme. Finally, we provide experiments to evaluate the learning
performance of HFL and our MACFL. The results show that our MACFL can enhance
the learning performance, especially for three different cases, namely, the
case of users with non-independent and identical distribution data, the case of
users with high mobility, and the cases with a small number of users.</span>

learning tasks, including streaming PCA, spectral clustering, and low-rank
matrix approximation. The distilled purpose of the vanilla power method is to
determine the largest eigenvalue (in absolute modulus) and its eigenvector of a
matrix. A momentum-based scheme can be used to accelerate the power method, but
achieving an optimal convergence rate with existing algorithms critically
relies on additional spectral information that is unavailable at run-time, and
sub-optimal initializations can result in divergence. In this paper, we provide
a pair of novel momentum-based power methods, which we call the delayed
momentum power method (DMPower) and a streaming variant, the delayed momentum
streaming method (DMStream). Our methods leverage inexact deflation and are
capable of achieving near-optimal convergence with far less restrictive
hyperparameter requirements. We provide convergence analyses for both
algorithms through the lens of perturbation theory. Further, we experimentally
demonstrate that DMPower routinely outperforms the vanilla power method and
that both algorithms match the convergence speed of an oracle running existing
accelerated methods with perfect spectral knowledge.</span>

applications, and various methods have been designed to improve the prediction
performance. However, existing works mainly focus on feature interactions and
ignore sample relations, e.g., users with the same education level might have a
similar ability to repay the debt. In this work, by explicitly and
systematically modeling sample relations, we propose a novel framework TabGNN
based on recently popular graph neural networks (GNN). Specifically, we firstly
construct a multiplex graph to model the multifaceted sample relations, and
then design a multiplex graph neural network to learn enhanced representation
for each sample. To integrate TabGNN with the tabular solution in our company,
we concatenate the learned embeddings and the original ones, which are then fed
to prediction models inside the solution. Experiments on eleven TDP datasets
from various domains, including classification and regression ones, show that
TabGNN can consistently improve the performance compared to the tabular
solution AutoFE in 4Paradigm.</span>

                                        <span>Training deep neural networks requires large scale data, which often forces
users to work in a distributed or outsourced setting, accompanied with privacy
concerns. Split learning framework aims to address this concern by splitting up
the model among the client and the server. The idea is that since the server
does not have access to client&#x27;s part of the model, the scheme supposedly
provides privacy. We show that this is not true via two novel attacks. (1) We
show that an honest-but-curious split learning server, equipped only with the
knowledge of the client neural network architecture, can recover the input
samples and also obtain a functionally similar model to the client model,
without the client being able to detect the attack. (2) Furthermore, we show
that if split learning is used naively to protect the training labels, the
honest-but-curious server can infer the labels with perfect accuracy. We test
our attacks using three benchmark datasets and investigate various properties
of the overall system that affect the attacks&#x27; effectiveness. Our results show
that plaintext split learning paradigm can pose serious security risks and
provide no more than a false sense of security.</span>

doing so, we ensure that the global model performance of the worst-case worker

facto approach to automated medical image diagnosis. Recently, vision
transformers (ViTs) have appeared as a competitive alternative to CNNs,
yielding similar levels of performance while possessing several interesting
properties that could prove beneficial for medical imaging tasks. In this work,
we explore whether it is time to move to transformer-based models or if we
should keep working with CNNs - can we trivially switch to transformers? If so,
what are the advantages and drawbacks of switching to ViTs for medical image
diagnosis? We consider these questions in a series of experiments on three
mainstream medical image datasets. Our findings show that, while CNNs perform
better when trained from scratch, off-the-shelf vision transformers using
default hyperparameters are on par with CNNs when pretrained on ImageNet, and
outperform their CNN counterparts when pretrained using self-supervision.</span>

                                        <span>In spin based quantum dot arrays, a leading technology for quantum
computation applications, material or fabrication imprecisions affect the
behaviour of the device, which is compensated via tuning parameters. Automatic
tuning of these device parameters constitutes a formidable challenge for
machine-learning. Here, we present the first practical algorithm for
controlling the transition of electrons in a spin qubit array. We exploit a
connection to computational geometry and phrase the task as estimating a convex
polytope from measurements.

Our proposed algorithm uses active learning, to find the count, shapes and
sizes of all facets of a given polytope. We test our algorithm on artifical
polytopes as well as a real 2x2 spin qubit array. Our results show that we can
reliably find the facets of the polytope, including small facets with sizes on
the order of the measurement precision. We discuss the implications of the
NP-hardness of the underlying estimation problem and outline design
considerations, limitations and tuning strategies for controlling future
large-scale spin qubit devices.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) is a recent development in the field of machine
learning that collaboratively trains models without the training data leaving
client devices, in order to preserve data-privacy. In realistic settings, the
total training set is distributed over clients in a highly non-Independent and
Identically Distributed (non-IID) fashion, which has been shown extensively to
harm FL convergence speed and final model performance. We propose a novel,
generalised approach for applying adaptive optimisation techniques to FL with
the Federated Global Biased Optimiser (FedGBO) algorithm. FedGBO accelerates FL
by applying a set of global biased optimiser values during the local training
phase of FL, which helps to reduce &#x60;client-drift&#x27; from non-IID data, whilst
also benefiting from adaptive momentum/learning-rate methods. We show that the
FedGBO update with a generic optimiser can be viewed as a centralised update
with biased gradients and optimiser update, and use this theoretical framework
to prove the convergence of FedGBO using momentum-Stochastic Gradient Descent.
We also perform extensive experiments using 4 realistic benchmark FL datasets
and 3 popular adaptive optimisers to compare the performance of different
adaptive-FL approaches, demonstrating that FedGBO has highly competitive
performance considering its low communication and computation costs, and
providing highly practical insights for the use of adaptive optimisation in FL.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding human mobility is essential for many fields, including
transportation planning. Currently, surveys are the primary source for such
analysis. However, in the recent past, many researchers have focused on Call
Detail Records (CDR) for identifying travel patterns. CDRs have shown
correlation to human mobility behavior. However, one of the main issues in
using CDR data is that it is difficult to identify the precise location of the
user due to the low spacial resolution of the data and other artifacts such as
the load sharing effect. Existing approaches have certain limitations. Previous
studies using CDRs do not consider the transmit power of cell towers when
localizing the users and use an oversimplified approach to identify load
sharing effects. Furthermore, they consider the entire population of users as
one group neglecting the differences in mobility patterns of different segments
of users. This research introduces a novel methodology to user position
localization from CDRs through improved detection of load sharing effects, by
taking the transmit power into account, and segmenting the users into distinct
groups for the purpose of learning any parameters of the model. Moreover, this
research uses several methods to address the existing limitations and validate
the generated results using nearly 4 billion CDR data points with travel survey
data and voluntarily collected mobile data.</span>

                                        <span>Describing images using natural language is widely known as image captioning,
which has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision
and natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning
models achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and
SPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other
similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few
pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,
which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between
objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same
album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the
distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning
Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar
group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a
group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that
are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other
images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,
resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in
the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and
GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate
(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results
indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of
several baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both
accuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the
quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric
DisWordRate.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of a classification model is to assign the correct labels to data.
In most cases, this data is not fully described by the given set of labels.
Often a rich set of meaningful concepts exist in the domain that can much more
precisely describe each datapoint. Such concepts can also be highly useful for
interpreting the model&#x27;s classifications. In this paper we propose a model,
denoted as Variational Autoencoder-based Contrastive Explanation (VAE-CE), that
represents data with high-level concepts and uses this representation for both
classification and generating explanations. The explanations are produced in a
contrastive manner, conveying why a datapoint is assigned to one class rather
than an alternative class. An explanation is specified as a set of
transformations of the input datapoint, with each step depicting a concept
changing towards the contrastive class. We build the model using a disentangled
VAE, extended with a new supervised method for disentangling individual
dimensions. An analysis on synthetic data and MNIST shows that the approaches
to both disentanglement and explanation provide benefits over other methods.</span>

networks, which demands efficient and effective learning algorithms. At the
same time, labels may only be available for some networks, which demands these
algorithms to be able to adapt to unlabeled networks. Domain-adaptive hash
learning has enjoyed considerable success in the computer vision community in
many practical tasks due to its lower cost in both retrieval time and storage
footprint. However, it has not been applied to multiple-domain networks. In
this work, we bridge this gap by developing an unsupervised domain-adaptive
hash learning method for networks, dubbed UDAH. Specifically, we develop four
{task-specific yet correlated} components: (1) network structure preservation
via a hard groupwise contrastive loss, (2) relaxation-free supervised hashing,
(3) cross-domain intersected discriminators, and (4) semantic center alignment.
We conduct a wide range of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our method on a range of tasks including link prediction, node
classification, and neighbor recommendation. Our evaluation results demonstrate
that our model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art
conventional discrete embedding methods over all the tasks.</span>

pattern recognition problems is widely recognized by academia, legislators and
enterprises alike. In previous work, we proposed a bias quantification measure,
called fuzzy-rough uncer-tainty, which relies on the fuzzy-rough set theory.
The intuition dictates that protected features should not change the
fuzzy-rough boundary regions of a decision class significantly. The extent to
which this happens is a proxy for bias expressed as uncertainty in
adecision-making context. Our measure&#x27;s main advantage is that it does not
depend on any machine learning prediction model but adistance function. In this
paper, we extend our study by exploring the existence of bias encoded
implicitly in non-protected featuresas defined by the correlation between
protected and unprotected attributes. This analysis leads to four scenarios
that domain experts should evaluate before deciding how to tackle bias. In
addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the fuzzy operatorsand
distance function that best capture change in the boundary regions.</span>

with a label noise-robust classification head requires fine-tuning the
representation in order to achieve state-of-the-art performances. Since
fine-tuned representations are shown to outperform frozen ones, one can
conclude that noise-robust classification heads are indeed able to promote
meaningful representations if provided with a suitable starting point.
Experiments are conducted to draw a comprehensive picture of performances by
featuring six methods and nine noise instances of three different kinds (none,
symmetric, and asymmetric). In presence of noise the experiments show that fine
tuning of Contrastive representation allows the six methods to achieve better
results than end-to-end learning and represent a new reference compare to the
recent state of art. Results are also remarkable stable versus the noise level.</span>

                                        <span>The current COVID-19 pandemic has put a huge challenge on the Indian health
infrastructure. With more and more people getting affected during the second
wave, the hospitals were over-burdened, running out of supplies and oxygen. In
this scenario, prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases beforehand might have
helped in the better utilization of limited resources and supplies. This
manuscript deals with the prediction of new COVID-19 cases, new deaths and
total active cases for multiple days in advance. The proposed method uses gated
recurrent unit networks as the main predicting model. A study is conducted by
building four models that are pre-trained on the data from four different
countries (United States of America, Brazil, Spain and Bangladesh) and are
fine-tuned or retrained on India&#x27;s data. Since the four countries chosen have
experienced different types of infection curves, the pre-training provides a
transfer learning to the models incorporating diverse situations into account.
Each of the four models then give a multiple days ahead predictions using
recursive learning method for the Indian test data. The final prediction comes
from an ensemble of the predictions of the combination of different models.
This method with two countries, Spain and Brazil, is seen to achieve the best
performance amongst all the combinations as well as compared to other
traditional regression models.</span>

dedicated to algorithmic development, aiming at designing more efficient and
less costly methods. Nonetheless, the investigation of the initialization of
these techniques remain scare, and currently most NAS methodologies rely on
stochastic initialization procedures, because acquiring information prior to
search is costly. However, the recent availability of NAS benchmarks have
enabled low computational resources prototyping. In this study, we propose to
accelerate a NAS algorithm using a data-driven initialization technique,
leveraging the availability of NAS benchmarks. Particularly, we proposed a
two-step methodology. First, a calibrated clustering analysis of the search
space is performed. Second, the centroids are extracted and used to initialize
a NAS algorithm. We tested our proposal using Aging Evolution, an evolutionary
algorithm, on NAS-bench-101. The results show that, compared to a random

                                        <span>Distributed deep learning frameworks, such as split learning, have recently
been proposed to enable a group of participants to collaboratively train a deep
neural network without sharing their raw data. Split learning in particular
achieves this goal by dividing a neural network between a client and a server
so that the client computes the initial set of layers, and the server computes
the rest. However, this method introduces a unique attack vector for a
malicious server attempting to steal the client&#x27;s private data: the server can
direct the client model towards learning a task of its choice. With a concrete
example already proposed, such training-hijacking attacks present a significant
risk for the data privacy of split learning clients.

In this paper, we propose SplitGuard, a method by which a split learning
client can detect whether it is being targeted by a training-hijacking attack
or not. We experimentally evaluate its effectiveness, and discuss in detail
various points related to its use. We conclude that SplitGuard can effectively
detect training-hijacking attacks while minimizing the amount of information
recovered by the adversaries.</span>

                                        <span>Though recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in single image
super-resolution (SISR) tasks with the prosperous development of deep neural
networks (DNNs), the deep learning methods are confronted with the computation
and memory consumption issues in practice, especially for resource-limited
platforms such as mobile devices. To overcome the challenge and facilitate the
real-time deployment of SISR tasks on mobile, we combine neural architecture
search with pruning search and propose an automatic search framework that
derives sparse super-resolution (SR) models with high image quality while
satisfying the real-time inference requirement. To decrease the search cost, we
leverage the weight sharing strategy by introducing a supernet and decouple the
search problem into three stages, including supernet construction,
compiler-aware architecture and pruning search, and compiler-aware pruning
ratio search. With the proposed framework, we are the first to achieve
real-time SR inference (with only tens of milliseconds per frame) for
implementing 720p resolution with competitive image quality (in terms of PSNR
and SSIM) on mobile platforms (Samsung Galaxy S20).</span>

navigate in realistic environments using natural language instructions. Given
the scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image
and language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments
remains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve
generalization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing
small-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements.
In this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN
dataset. We first collect image-caption (IC) pairs from hundreds of thousands
of listings from online rental marketplaces. Using IC pairs we next propose
automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs.
We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal
order inside PI pairs. We use BnB pretrain our Airbert model that can be
adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms
state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring
Expression (REVERIE) benchmarks. Moreover, our in-domain pretraining
significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation,
where we train the model only on VLN instructions from a few houses.</span>

is robust to (distributional) perturbations in the data using Distributionally
Robust Optimization (DRO) under the Wasserstein metric. Beginning with
fundamental properties of the Wasserstein metric and the DRO formulation, we
explore duality to arrive at tractable formulations and develop finite-sample,
as well as asymptotic, performance guarantees. We consider a series of learning
problems, including (i) distributionally robust linear regression; (ii)
distributionally robust regression with group structure in the predictors;
(iii) distributionally robust multi-output regression and multiclass
classification, (iv) optimal decision making that combines distributionally
robust regression with nearest-neighbor estimation; (v) distributionally robust
semi-supervised learning, and (vi) distributionally robust reinforcement
learning. A tractable DRO relaxation for each problem is being derived,
establishing a connection between robustness and regularization, and obtaining
bounds on the prediction and estimation errors of the solution. Beyond theory,
we include numerical experiments and case studies using synthetic and real
data. The real data experiments are all associated with various health
informatics problems, an application area which provided the initial impetus
for this work.</span>

model consists of a set of silos, each holding a vertical partition of the
data. Each silo contains a hub and a set of clients, with the silo&#x27;s vertical
data shard partitioned horizontally across its clients. We propose Tiered
Decentralized Coordinate Descent (TDCD), a communication-efficient
decentralized training algorithm for such two-tiered networks. To reduce
communication overhead, the clients in each silo perform multiple local
gradient steps before sharing updates with their hub. Each hub adjusts its
coordinates by averaging its workers&#x27; updates, and then hubs exchange
intermediate updates with one another. We present a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm and show the dependence of the convergence rate on the number of
vertical partitions, the number of local updates, and the number of clients in
each hub. We further validate our approach empirically via simulation-based

                                        <span>Automated next-best action recommendation for each customer in a sequential,
dynamic and interactive context has been widely needed in natural, social and
business decision-making. Personalized next-best action recommendation must
involve past, current and future customer demographics and circumstances
(states) and behaviors, long-range sequential interactions between customers
and decision-makers, multi-sequence interactions between states, behaviors and
actions, and their reactions to their counterpart&#x27;s actions. No existing
modeling theories and tools, including Markovian decision processes, user and
behavior modeling, deep sequential modeling, and personalized sequential
recommendation, can quantify such complex decision-making on a personal level.
We take a data-driven approach to learn the next-best actions for personalized
decision-making by a reinforced coupled recurrent neural network (CRN). CRN
represents multiple coupled dynamic sequences of a customer&#x27;s historical and
current states, responses to decision-makers&#x27; actions, decision rewards to
actions, and learns long-term multi-sequence interactions between parties
(customer and decision-maker). Next-best actions are then recommended on each
customer at a time point to change their state for an optimal decision-making
objective. Our study demonstrates the potential of personalized deep learning
of multi-sequence interactions and automated dynamic intervention for
personalized decision-making in complex systems.</span>

multiple online activities on various contents and create fast widespread
interactions. However, this rapidly growing access has also increased the
diverse information, and characterizing user types to understand people&#x27;s

                                        <span>Continual learning is the problem of learning and retaining knowledge through
time over multiple tasks and environments. Research has primarily focused on
the incremental classification setting, where new tasks/classes are added at
discrete time intervals. Such an &quot;offline&quot; setting does not evaluate the
ability of agents to learn effectively and efficiently, since an agent can
perform multiple learning epochs without any time limitation when a task is
added. We argue that &quot;online&quot; continual learning, where data is a single
continuous stream without task boundaries, enables evaluating both information
retention and online learning efficacy. In online continual learning, each
incoming small batch of data is first used for testing and then added to the
training set, making the problem truly online. Trained models are later
evaluated on historical data to assess information retention. We introduce a
new benchmark for online continual visual learning that exhibits large scale
and natural distribution shifts. Through a large-scale analysis, we identify
critical and previously unobserved phenomena of gradient-based optimization in
continual learning, and propose effective strategies for improving
gradient-based online continual learning with real data. The source code and

by automatic anomaly detection systems. Although anomaly detection has been
investigated in the past, it remains unsolved in cloud computing. Challenges
are: characterizing the normal behavior of a cloud server, distinguishing
between benign and malicious anomalies (attacks), and preventing alert fatigue
due to false alarms.

We propose CloudShield, a practical and generalizable real-time anomaly and
attack detection system for cloud computing. Cloudshield uses a general,
pretrained deep learning model with different cloud workloads, to predict the
normal behavior and provide real-time and continuous detection by examining the
model reconstruction error distributions. Once an anomaly is detected, to
reduce alert fatigue, CloudShield automatically distinguishes between benign
programs, known attacks, and zero-day attacks, by examining the prediction
error distributions. We evaluate the proposed CloudShield on representative
cloud benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that CloudShield, using model
pretraining, can apply to a wide scope of cloud workloads. Especially, we
observe that CloudShield can detect the recently proposed speculative execution
attacks, e.g., Spectre and Meltdown attacks, in milliseconds. Furthermore, we
show that CloudShield accurately differentiates and prioritizes known attacks,
and potential zero-day attacks, from benign programs. Thus, it significantly
reduces false alarms by up to 99.0%.</span>

                                        <span>The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in practical stochastic
decision-making problems: first predict unknown parameters of an optimization
model, then solve the problem using the predicted values. A natural loss
function in this setting is defined by measuring the decision error induced by
the predicted parameters, which was named the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO)
loss by Elmachtoub and Grigas [arXiv:1710.08005]. Since the SPO loss is
typically nonconvex and possibly discontinuous, Elmachtoub and Grigas
[arXiv:1710.08005] introduced a convex surrogate, called the SPO+ loss, that
importantly accounts for the underlying structure of the optimization model. In
this paper, we greatly expand upon the consistency results for the SPO+ loss
provided by Elmachtoub and Grigas [arXiv:1710.08005]. We develop risk bounds
and uniform calibration results for the SPO+ loss relative to the SPO loss,
which provide a quantitative way to transfer the excess surrogate risk to
excess true risk. By combining our risk bounds with generalization bounds, we
show that the empirical minimizer of the SPO+ loss achieves low excess true
risk with high probability. We first demonstrate these results in the case when
the feasible region of the underlying optimization problem is a polyhedron, and
then we show that the results can be strengthened substantially when the
feasible region is a level set of a strongly convex function. We perform
experiments to empirically demonstrate the strength of the SPO+ surrogate, as
compared to standard $\ell_1$ and squared $\ell_2$ prediction error losses, on
portfolio allocation and cost-sensitive multi-class classification problems.</span>

new modifications to existing algorithms for a set of problems in computer
vision. Loosely speaking, our formulation is related to both explicit and
implicit strategies for data augmentation and group equivariance, but is
derived from new results in the SDE literature on estimating infinitesimal
generators of a class of stochastic processes. If and when there is nominal
agreement between the needs of an application/task and the inherent properties
and behavior of the types of processes that we can efficiently handle, we
obtain a very simple and efficient plug-in layer that can be incorporated
within any existing network architecture, with minimal modification and only a
few additional parameters. We show promising experiments on a number of vision

                                        <span>Medical image classification is often challenging for two reasons: a lack of
labelled examples due to expensive and time-consuming annotation protocols, and
imbalanced class labels due to the relative scarcity of disease-positive
individuals in the wider population. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods
exist for dealing with a lack of labels, but they generally do not address the
problem of class imbalance. In this study we propose Adaptive Blended
Consistency Loss (ABCL), a drop-in replacement for consistency loss in
perturbation-based SSL methods. ABCL counteracts data skew by adaptively mixing
the target class distribution of the consistency loss in accordance with class
frequency. Our experiments with ABCL reveal improvements to unweighted average
recall on two different imbalanced medical image classification datasets when
compared with existing consistency losses that are not designed to counteract
class imbalance.</span>

                                        <span>In-memory computing (IMC) on a monolithic chip for deep learning faces
dramatic challenges on area, yield, and on-chip interconnection cost due to the
ever-increasing model sizes. 2.5D integration or chiplet-based architectures
interconnect multiple small chips (i.e., chiplets) to form a large computing
system, presenting a feasible solution beyond a monolithic IMC architecture to
accelerate large deep learning models. This paper presents a new benchmarking
simulator, SIAM, to evaluate the performance of chiplet-based IMC architectures
and explore the potential of such a paradigm shift in IMC architecture design.
SIAM integrates device, circuit, architecture, network-on-chip (NoC),
network-on-package (NoP), and DRAM access models to realize an end-to-end
system. SIAM is scalable in its support of a wide range of deep neural networks
(DNNs), customizable to various network structures and configurations, and
capable of efficient design space exploration. We demonstrate the flexibility,
scalability, and simulation speed of SIAM by benchmarking different
state-of-the-art DNNs with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. We
further calibrate the simulation results with a published silicon result,
SIMBA. The chiplet-based IMC architecture obtained through SIAM shows
130$\times$ and 72$\times$ improvement in energy-efficiency for ResNet-50 on
the ImageNet dataset compared to Nvidia V100 and T4 GPUs.</span>

                                        <span>Knowing the causal structure of a system is of fundamental interest in many
areas of science and can aid the design of prediction algorithms that work well
under manipulations to the system. The causal structure becomes identifiable
from the observational distribution under certain restrictions. To learn the
structure from data, score-based methods evaluate different graphs according to
the quality of their fits. However, for large nonlinear models, these rely on
heuristic optimization approaches with no general guarantees of recovering the
true causal structure. In this paper, we consider structure learning of
directed trees. We propose a fast and scalable method based on Chu-Liu-Edmonds&#x27;
algorithm we call causal additive trees (CAT). For the case of Gaussian errors,
we prove consistency in an asymptotic regime with a vanishing identifiability
gap. We also introduce a method for testing substructure hypotheses with
asymptotic family-wise error rate control that is valid post-selection and in
unidentified settings. Furthermore, we study the identifiability gap, which
quantifies how much better the true causal model fits the observational
distribution, and prove that it is lower bounded by local properties of the
causal model. Simulation studies demonstrate the favorable performance of CAT
compared to competing structure learning methods.</span>

behavior in a human-like manner aiming at non-expert end-users. An efficient
alternative of creating explanations is to use an introspection-based method
that transforms Q-values into probabilities of success used as the base to
explain the agent&#x27;s decision-making process. This approach has been effectively
used in episodic and discrete scenarios, however, to compute the probability of
success in non-episodic and more complex environments has not been addressed
yet. In this work, we adapt the introspection method to be used in a
non-episodic task and try it in a continuous Atari game scenario solved with
the Rainbow algorithm. Our initial results show that the probability of success

always been a challenge, especially, for complex scenes with many components.
In this work, we introduce Plug and Play Markov Decision Processes, an
object-based representation that allows zero-shot integration of new objects
from known object classes. This is achieved by representing the global
transition dynamics as a union of local transition functions, each with respect
to one active object in the scene. Transition dynamics from an object class can
be pre-learnt and thus would be ready to use in a new environment. Each active
object is also endowed with its reward function. Since there is no central
reward function, addition or removal of objects can be handled efficiently by
only updating the reward functions of objects involved. A new transfer learning
mechanism is also proposed to adapt reward function in such cases. Experiments
show that our representation can achieve sample-efficiency in a variety of
set-ups.</span>

robustness against adversarial examples. Besides the security concerns of
potential adversarial examples, adversarial training can also improve the
performance of the neural networks, train robust neural networks, and provide
interpretability for neural networks. In this work, we take the first step to
introduce adversarial training in time series analysis by taking the finance
field as an example. Rethinking existing researches of adversarial training, we
propose the adaptively scaled adversarial training (ASAT) in time series
analysis, by treating data at different time slots with time-dependent
importance weights. Experimental results show that the proposed ASAT can
improve both the accuracy and the adversarial robustness of neural networks.
Besides enhancing neural networks, we also propose the dimension-wise
adversarial sensitivity indicator to probe the sensitivities and importance of
input dimensions. With the proposed indicator, we can explain the decision
bases of black box neural networks.</span>

often unaffordable due to high sample requirements. Surrogate models based on
statistical and machine learning methods are used to increase the sample
efficiency. However, for higher dimensional or multi-modal systems, surrogate
models may also require a large amount of samples to achieve good results. We
propose a sequential sampling strategy for the surrogate based solution of
multi-objective reliability based robust design optimization problems. Proposed
local Latin hypercube refinement (LoLHR) strategy is model-agnostic and can be
combined with any surrogate model because there is no free lunch but possibly a
budget one. The proposed method is compared to stationary sampling as well as
other proposed strategies from the literature. Gaussian process and support
vector regression are both used as surrogate models. Empirical evidence is
presented, showing that LoLHR achieves on average better results compared to
other surrogate based strategies on the tested examples.</span>

recognise novel classes with only a few labeled examples in the last few years.
Few-shot learning (FSL) for action recognition is a challenging task of
recognising novel action categories which are represented by few instances in
the training data. We propose a novel variational inference based architectural
framework (HF-AR) for few shot activity recognition. Our framework leverages
volume-preserving Householder Flow to learn a flexible posterior distribution
of the novel classes. This results in better performance as compared to
state-of-the-art few shot approaches for human activity recognition. approach
consists of base model and an adapter model. Our architecture consists of a
base model and an adapter model. The base model is trained on seen classes and
it computes an embedding that represent the spatial and temporal insights
extracted from the input video, e.g. combination of Resnet-152 and LSTM based
encoder-decoder model. The adapter model applies a series of Householder
transformations to compute a flexible posterior distribution that lends higher
accuracy in the few shot approach. Extensive experiments on three well-known
datasets: UCF101, HMDB51 and Something-Something-V2, demonstrate similar or
better performance on 1-shot and 5-shot classification as compared to
state-of-the-art few shot approaches that use only RGB frame sequence as input.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore variational inference
along with householder transformations to capture the full rank covariance
matrix of posterior distribution, for few shot learning in activity
recognition.</span>

attack against cardiac diagnosis system powered by machine learning algorithms.
To this end, we introduce adversarial beats, which are adversarial
perturbations tailored specifically against electrocardiograms (ECGs)
beat-by-beat classification system. We first formulate an algorithm to generate
adversarial examples for the ECG classification neural network model, and study
its attack success rate. Next, to evaluate its feasibility in a physical
environment, we mount a hardware attack by designing a malicious signal
generator which injects adversarial beats into ECG sensor readings. To the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first in evaluating the proficiency of
adversarial examples for ECGs in a physical setup. Our real-world experiments
demonstrate that adversarial beats successfully manipulated the diagnosis
results 3-5 times out of 40 attempts throughout the course of 2 minutes.
Finally, we discuss the overall feasibility and impact of the attack, by
clearly defining motives and constraints of expected attackers along with our
experimental results.</span>

interference. They used a neural network that tried to learn addition using two
groups of examples as two different tasks. In their case, learning the second
task rapidly deteriorated the acquired knowledge about the previous one. This
could be a symptom of a fundamental problem: addition is an algorithmic task
that should not be learned through pattern recognition. We propose to use a
neural network with a different architecture that can be trained to recover the
correct algorithm for the addition of binary numbers. We test it in the setting
proposed by McCloskey and Cohen and training on random examples one by one. The
neural network not only does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting but it
improves its predictive power on unseen pairs of numbers as training
progresses. This work emphasizes the importance that neural network
architecture has for the emergence of catastrophic forgetting and introduces a
neural network that is able to learn an algorithm.</span>

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, generating pseudo labels or low confidence
labels on the entire unlabeled test dataset, and then, (2) filter out quality
generated labels and, (3) combining the generated labels with the previously
available high confidence labeled dataset. This assimilated dataset is used for
the next round of training ensemble models. This cyclical process is repeated
until the performance improvement plateaus. Additionally, we post process our
results with Conditional Random Fields. Our approach sets the second highest
score on the public hold-out test leaderboard for the ETCI competition with
0.7654 IoU. To the best of our knowledge we believe this is one of the first

                                        <span>There is currently a burgeoning demand for deploying deep learning (DL)
models on ubiquitous edge Internet of Things devices attributing to their low
latency and high privacy preservation. However, DL models are often large in
size and require large-scale computation, which prevents them from being placed
directly onto IoT devices where resources are constrained and 32-bit
floating-point operations are unavailable. Model quantization is a pragmatic
solution, which enables DL deployment on mobile devices and embedded systems by
effortlessly post-quantizing a large high-precision model into a small
low-precision model while retaining the model inference accuracy.

This work reveals that the standard quantization operation can be abused to
activate a backdoor. We demonstrate that a full-precision backdoored model that
does not have any backdoor effect in the presence of a trigger -- as the
backdoor is dormant -- can be activated by the default TensorFlow-Lite
quantization, the only product-ready quantization framework to date. We
ascertain that all trained float-32 backdoored models exhibit no backdoor
effect even in the presence of trigger inputs. State-of-the-art frontend
detection approaches, such as Neural Cleanse and STRIP, fail to identify the
backdoor in the float-32 models. When each of the float-32 models is converted
into an int-8 format model through the standard TFLite post-training
quantization, the backdoor is activated in the quantized model, which shows a
stable attack success rate close to 100% upon inputs with the trigger, while
behaves normally upon non-trigger inputs. This work highlights that a stealthy
security threat occurs when end users utilize the on-device post-training model
quantization toolkits, informing security researchers of cross-platform
overhaul of DL models post quantization even if they pass frontend inspections.</span>

efforts and in understanding biodiversity loss. The automation of this process
has been facilitated by both sensing technologies, such as passive acoustic

                                        <span>Social media such as Instagram and Twitter have become important platforms
for marketing and selling illicit drugs. Detection of online illicit drug
trafficking has become critical to combat the online trade of illicit drugs.
However, the legal status often varies spatially and temporally; even for the
same drug, federal and state legislation can have different regulations about
its legality. Meanwhile, more drug trafficking events are disguised as a novel
form of advertising commenting leading to information heterogeneity.
Accordingly, accurate detection of illicit drug trafficking events (IDTEs) from
social media has become even more challenging. In this work, we conduct the
first systematic study on fine-grained detection of IDTEs on Instagram. We
propose to take a deep multimodal multilabel learning (DMML) approach to detect
IDTEs and demonstrate its effectiveness on a newly constructed dataset called
multimodal IDTE(MM-IDTE). Specifically, our model takes text and image data as
the input and combines multimodal information to predict multiple labels of
illicit drugs. Inspired by the success of BERT, we have developed a
self-supervised multimodal bidirectional transformer by jointly fine-tuning
pretrained text and image encoders. We have constructed a large-scale dataset
MM-IDTE with manually annotated multiple drug labels to support fine-grained
detection of illicit drugs. Extensive experimental results on the MM-IDTE
dataset show that the proposed DMML methodology can accurately detect IDTEs
even in the presence of special characters and style changes attempting to
evade detection.</span>

In this work, we introduce an extension for self-supervised learning techniques

fractal-effect assumes that the same structures (for example rivers, peaks and

the responsibility of the quality of data. Data Quality refers to the relevance
of the information present and helps in various operations like decision making
and planning in a particular organization. Mostly data quality is measured on
an ad-hoc basis, and hence none of the developed concepts provide any practical
application. The current empirical study was undertaken to formulate a concrete
automated data quality platform to assess the quality of incoming dataset and
generate a quality label, score and comprehensive report. We utilize various
datasets from healthdata.gov, opendata.nhs and Demographics and Health Surveys
(DHS) Program to observe the variations in the quality score and formulate a
label using Principal Component Analysis(PCA). The results of the current
empirical study revealed a metric that encompasses nine quality ingredients,
namely provenance, dataset characteristics, uniformity, metadata coupling,
percentage of missing cells and duplicate rows, skewness of data, the ratio of
inconsistencies of categorical columns, and correlation between these
attributes. The study also provides an illustrative case study and validation
of the metric following Mutation Testing approaches. This research study
provides an automated platform which takes an incoming dataset and metadata to
provide the DQ score, report and label. The results of this study would be
useful to data scientists as the value of this quality label would instill
confidence before deploying the data for his/her respective practical

model for unknown target domains from multiple training source domains with
different distributions. Significant efforts have recently been committed to
broad domain generalization, which is a challenging and topical problem in
machine learning and computer vision communities. Most previous domain
generalization approaches assume that the conditional distribution across the
domains remain the same across the source domains and learn a domain invariant
model by minimizing the marginal distributions. However, the assumption of a
stable conditional distribution of the training source domains does not really
hold in practice. The hyperplane learned from the source domains will easily
misclassify samples scattered at the boundary of clusters or far from their
corresponding class centres. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose a
discriminative domain-invariant adversarial network (DDIAN) for domain
generalization. The discriminativeness of the features are guaranteed through a
discriminative feature module and domain-invariant features are guaranteed
through the global domain and local sub-domain alignment modules. Extensive
experiments on several benchmarks show that DDIAN achieves better prediction on
unseen target data during training compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender system plays a crucial role in modern E-commerce platform. Due to
the lack of historical interactions between users and items, cold-start
recommendation is a challenging problem. In order to alleviate the cold-start
issue, most existing methods introduce content and contextual information as
the auxiliary information. Nevertheless, these methods assume the recommended
items behave steadily over time, while in a typical E-commerce scenario, items
generally have very different performances throughout their life period. In
such a situation, it would be beneficial to consider the long-term return from
the item perspective, which is usually ignored in conventional methods.
Reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits such a long-term optimization
problem, in which the recommender could identify high potential items,
proactively allocate more user impressions to boost their growth, therefore
improve the multi-period cumulative gains. Inspired by this idea, we model the
process as a Partially Observable and Controllable Markov Decision Process
(POC-MDP), and propose an actor-critic RL framework (RL-LTV) to incorporate the
item lifetime values (LTV) into the recommendation. In RL-LTV, the critic
studies historical trajectories of items and predict the future LTV of fresh
item, while the actor suggests a score-based policy which maximizes the future
LTV expectation. Scores suggested by the actor are then combined with classical
ranking scores in a dual-rank framework, therefore the recommendation is
balanced with the LTV consideration. Our method outperforms the strong live
baseline with a relative improvement of 8.67% and 18.03% on IPV and GMV of
cold-start items, on one of the largest E-commerce platform.</span>

                                        <span>Implicit neural representation is a recent approach to learn shape
collections as zero level-sets of neural networks, where each shape is
represented by a latent code. So far, the focus has been shape reconstruction,
while shape generalization was mostly left to generic encoder-decoder or
auto-decoder regularization.

In this paper we advocate deformation-aware regularization for implicit
neural representations, aiming at producing plausible deformations as latent
code changes. The challenge is that implicit representations do not capture
correspondences between different shapes, which makes it difficult to represent
and regularize their deformations. Thus, we propose to pair the implicit
representation of the shapes with an explicit, piecewise linear deformation
field, learned as an auxiliary function. We demonstrate that, by regularizing
these deformation fields, we can encourage the implicit neural representation
to induce natural deformations in the learned shape space, such as
as-rigid-as-possible deformations.</span>

around the world, especially in the State of California. The high-level
concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted by wildfires aggravates global
warming that further increases the risk of more fires. Therefore, an accurate
prediction of wildfire occurrence greatly helps in preventing large-scale and
long-lasting wildfires and reducing the consequent GHG emissions. Various
methods have been explored for wildfire risk prediction. However, the complex
correlations among a lot of natural and human factors and wildfire ignition
make the prediction task very challenging. In this paper, we develop a deep
learning based data augmentation approach for wildfire risk prediction. We
build a dataset consisting of diverse features responsible for fire ignition
and utilize a conditional tabular generative adversarial network to explore the
underlying patterns between the target value of risk levels and all involved
features. For fair and comprehensive comparisons, we compare our proposed
scheme with five other baseline methods where the former outperformed most of
them. To corroborate the robustness, we have also tested the performance of our
method with another dataset that also resulted in better efficiency. By
adopting the proposed method, we can take preventive strategies of wildfire
mitigation to reduce global GHG emissions.</span>

decrease if every patient could get suitable treatment by the healthcare
system. Machine learning, especially computer vision methods based on deep
learning, can help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat COVID-19
infected cases more efficiently. Hence, infected patients can get better
service from the healthcare system and decrease the number of deaths caused by
the coronavirus. This research proposes a method for segmenting infected lung
regions in a CT image. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network with an
attention mechanism is used to detect infected areas with complex patterns.
Attention blocks improve the segmentation accuracy by focusing on informative

synthetic images for data augmentation and expansion of small available

                                        <span>With increasing advancements in technologies for capturing 360{\deg} videos,
advances in streaming such videos have become a popular research topic.
However, streaming 360{\deg} videos require high bandwidth, thus escalating the
need for developing optimized streaming algorithms. Researchers have proposed
various methods to tackle the problem, considering the network bandwidth or
attempt to predict future viewports in advance. However, most of the existing
works either (1) do not consider video contents to predict user viewport, or
(2) do not adapt to user preferences dynamically, or (3) require a lot of
training data for new videos, thus making them potentially unfit for video
streaming purposes. We develop PARIMA, a fast and efficient online viewport
prediction model that uses past viewports of users along with the trajectories
of prime objects as a representative of video content to predict future
viewports. We claim that the head movement of a user majorly depends upon the
trajectories of the prime objects in the video. We employ a pyramid-based
bitrate allocation scheme and perform a comprehensive evaluation of the
performance of PARIMA. In our evaluation, we show that PARIMA outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, improving the Quality of Experience by over 30\%
while maintaining a short response time.</span>

                                        <span>Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted much attention with the
prevalence of accessible depth sensors. Recently, graph convolutional networks
(GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to
model graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for
modeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly
focus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is
learned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer
of the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple
sets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The
reason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and
conventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights
into GCNs. To overcome this gap, we reinvent the split-transform-merge strategy
in GCNs for skeleton sequence processing. Specifically, we design a simple and
highly modularized graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based
action recognition. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block
that aggregates multi-granularity information from both the spatial and
temporal paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin with only 1/5 of the
parameters and 1/10 of the FLOPs. Code is available at

the world with the development of related technologies. The expected metaverse
should be a realistic society with more direct and physical interactions, while
the concepts of race, gender, and even physical disability would be weakened,
which would be highly beneficial for society. However, the development of
metaverse is still in its infancy, with great potential for improvement.
Regarding metaverse&#x27;s huge potential, industry has already come forward with
advance preparation, accompanied by feverish investment, but there are few
discussions about metaverse in academia to scientifically guide its
development. In this paper, we highlight the representative applications for
social good. Then we propose a three-layer metaverse architecture from a macro
perspective, containing infrastructure, interaction, and ecosystem. Moreover,
we journey toward both a historical and novel metaverse with a detailed
timeline and table of specific attributes. Lastly, we illustrate our

                                        <span>The formulation of a claim rests at the core of argument mining. To demarcate
between a claim and a non-claim is arduous for both humans and machines, owing
to latent linguistic variance between the two and the inadequacy of extensive
definition-based formalization. Furthermore, the increase in the usage of
online social media has resulted in an explosion of unsolicited information on
the web presented as informal text. To account for the aforementioned, in this
paper, we proposed DESYR. It is a framework that intends on annulling the said
issues for informal web-based text by leveraging a combination of hierarchical
representation learning (dependency-inspired Poincare embedding),
definition-based alignment, and feature projection. We do away with fine-tuning
computer-heavy language models in favor of fabricating a more domain-centric
but lighter approach. Experimental results indicate that DESYR builds upon the
state-of-the-art system across four benchmark claim datasets, most of which
were constructed with informal texts. We see an increase of 3 claim-F1 points
on the LESA-Twitter dataset, an increase of 1 claim-F1 point and 9 macro-F1
points on the Online Comments(OC) dataset, an increase of 24 claim-F1 points
and 17 macro-F1 points on the Web Discourse(WD) dataset, and an increase of 8
claim-F1 points and 5 macro-F1 points on the Micro Texts(MT) dataset. We also
perform an extensive analysis of the results. We make a 100-D pre-trained
version of our Poincare-variant along with the source code.</span>

model that jointly learns representations of images and texts. The model is
trained on a massive amount of English data and shows impressive performance on
zero-shot classification tasks. Training the same model on a different language
is not trivial, since data in other languages might be not enough and the model
needs high-quality translations of the texts to guarantee a good performance.
In this paper, we present the first CLIP model for the Italian Language

that CLIP-Italian outperforms the multilingual CLIP model on the tasks of image

human-written natural language explanations to SNLI-VE-2.0. Finally, we train

system for intelligent consultation, which can communicate with patients in
real-time, thereby improving the efficiency of clinical diagnosis with broad
application prospects. This paper presents our proposed framework for the
Chinese MDG organized by the 2021 China conference on knowledge graph and
semantic computing (CCKS) competition, which requires generating
context-consistent and medically meaningful responses conditioned on the
dialogue history. In our framework, we propose a pipeline system composed of
entity prediction and entity-aware dialogue generation, by adding predicted
entities to the dialogue model with a fusion mechanism, thereby utilizing
information from different sources. At the decoding stage, we propose a new
decoding mechanism named Entity-revised Diverse Beam Search (EDBS) to improve
entity correctness and promote the length and quality of the final response.
The proposed method wins both the CCKS and the International Conference on
Learning Representations (ICLR) 2021 Workshop Machine Learning for Preventing

demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our method.</span>

or multiple datasets of a single task. In reality, a truly useful VidL system
is expected to be easily generalizable to diverse tasks, domains, and datasets.
To facilitate the evaluation of such systems, we introduce Video-And-Language
Understanding Evaluation (VALUE) benchmark, an assemblage of 11 VidL datasets
over 3 popular tasks: (i) text-to-video retrieval; (ii) video question
answering; and (iii) video captioning. VALUE benchmark aims to cover a broad
range of video genres, video lengths, data volumes, and task difficulty levels.
Rather than focusing on single-channel videos with visual information only,
VALUE promotes models that leverage information from both video frames and
their associated subtitles, as well as models that share knowledge across
multiple tasks. We evaluate various baseline methods with and without
large-scale VidL pre-training, and systematically investigate the impact of
video input channels, fusion methods, and different video representations. We
also study the transferability between tasks, and conduct multi-task learning
under different settings. The significant gap between our best model and human
performance calls for future study for advanced VidL models. VALUE is available

data with billions of facts, involving millions of entities and thousands of
predicates. For efficiency, QA systems first reduce the answer search space by
identifying a set of facts that is likely to contain all answers and relevant
cues. The most common technique is to apply named entity disambiguation (NED)
systems to the question, and retrieve KB facts for the disambiguated entities.
This work presents ECQA, an efficient method that prunes irrelevant parts of
the search space using KB-aware signals. ECQA is based on top-k query
processing over score-ordered lists of KB items that combine signals about
lexical matching, relevance to the question, coherence among candidate items,
and connectivity in the KB graph. Experiments with two recent QA benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of ECQA over state-of-the-art baselines with

                                        <span>The goal of text ranking is to generate an ordered list of texts retrieved
from a corpus in response to a query. Although the most common formulation of
text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural
language processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text
ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT
is the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised
pretraining has been responsible for a paradigm shift in natural language
processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond. In this survey, we
provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for
practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply
transformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work
in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two
high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage
architectures and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly.
There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long
documents, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing in NLP, and
techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result
quality) and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although
transformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,
many aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well
understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open

                                        <span>Question answering over knowledge graphs and other RDF data has been greatly
advanced, with a number of good systems providing crisp answers for natural
language questions or telegraphic queries. Some of these systems incorporate
textual sources as additional evidence for the answering process, but cannot
compute answers that are present in text alone. Conversely, systems from the IR
and NLP communities have addressed QA over text, but barely utilize semantic
data and knowledge. This paper presents the first QA system that can seamlessly
operate over RDF datasets and text corpora, or both together, in a unified
framework. Our method, called UNIQORN, builds a context graph on the fly, by
retrieving question-relevant triples from the RDF data and/or the text corpus,
where the latter case is handled by automatic information extraction. The
resulting graph is typically rich but highly noisy. UNIQORN copes with this
input by advanced graph algorithms for Group Steiner Trees, that identify the
best answer candidates in the context graph. Experimental results on several
benchmarks of complex questions with multiple entities and relations, show that
UNIQORN, an unsupervised method with only five parameters, produces results
comparable to the state-of-the-art on KGs, text corpora, and heterogeneous
sources. The graph-based methodology provides user-interpretable evidence for
the complete answering process.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, the retrieval models based on dense representations have been
gradually applied in the first stage of the document retrieval tasks, showing
better performance than traditional sparse vector space models. To obtain high
efficiency, the basic structure of these models is Bi-encoder in most cases.
However, this simple structure may cause serious information loss during the
encoding of documents since the queries are agnostic. To address this problem,
we design a method to mimic the queries on each of the documents by an
iterative clustering process and represent the documents by multiple pseudo
queries (i.e., the cluster centroids). To boost the retrieval process using
approximate nearest neighbor search library, we also optimize the matching
function with a two-step score calculation procedure. Experimental results on
several popular ranking and QA datasets show that our model can achieve
state-of-the-art results.</span>

similarity annotations. The data originate from the journalistic domain in the
Czech language. We describe the process of collecting and annotating the data
in detail. The dataset contains 138,556 human annotations divided into train
and test sets. In total, 485 journalism students participated in the creation
process. To increase the reliability of the test set, we compute the annotation
as an average of 9 individual annotations. We evaluate the quality of the
dataset by measuring inter and intra annotation annotators&#x27; agreements. Beside
agreement numbers, we provide detailed statistics of the collected dataset. We
conclude our paper with a baseline experiment of building a system for
predicting the semantic similarity of sentences. Due to the massive number of
training annotations (116 956), the model can perform significantly better than
an average annotator (0,92 versus 0,86 of Person&#x27;s correlation coefficients).</span>

suffers from the data scarcity problem. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
data augmentation for slot filling task in SLU. To achieve that, we aim at
generating more diverse data based on existing data. Specifically, we try to
exploit the latent language knowledge from pretrained language models by
finetuning them. We propose two strategies for finetuning process: value-based
and context-based augmentation. Experimental results on two public SLU datasets

often correlate poorly with human judgements. Newer metrics such as BERTScore
have addressed many weaknesses in prior metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, which
rely on n-gram matching. These newer methods, however, are still limited in
that they do not consider the generation context, so they cannot properly
reward generated text that is correct but deviates from the given reference.

In this paper, we propose Language Model Augmented Relevance Score (MARS), a
new context-aware metric for NLG evaluation. MARS leverages off-the-shelf
language models, guided by reinforcement learning, to create augmented
references that consider both the generation context and available human
references, which are then used as additional references to score generated
text. Compared with seven existing metrics in three common NLG tasks, MARS not
only achieves higher correlation with human reference judgements, but also
differentiates well-formed candidates from adversarial samples to a larger
degree.</span>

                                        <span>Legal interpretation is a linguistic venture. In judicial opinions, for
example, courts are often asked to interpret the text of statutes and
legislation. As time has shown, this is not always as easy as it sounds.
Matters can hinge on vague or inconsistent language and, under the surface,
human biases can impact the decision-making of judges. This raises an important
question: what if there was a method of extracting the meaning of statutes
consistently? That is, what if it were possible to use machines to encode
legislation in a mathematically precise form that would permit clearer
responses to legal questions? This article attempts to unpack the notion of
machine-readability, providing an overview of both its historical and recent
developments. The paper will reflect on logic syntax and symbolic language to
assess the capacity and limits of representing legal knowledge. In doing so,
the paper seeks to move beyond existing literature to discuss the implications
of various approaches to machine-readable legislation. Importantly, this study
hopes to highlight the challenges encountered in this burgeoning ecosystem of
machine-readable legislation against existing human-readable counterparts.</span>

                                        <span>We present Mr. TyDi, a multi-lingual benchmark dataset for mono-lingual
retrieval in eleven typologically diverse languages, designed to evaluate
ranking with learned dense representations. The goal of this resource is to
spur research in dense retrieval techniques in non-English languages, motivated
by recent observations that existing techniques for representation learning
perform poorly when applied to out-of-distribution data. As a starting point,
we provide zero-shot baselines for this new dataset based on a multi-lingual
adaptation of DPR that we call &quot;mDPR&quot;. Experiments show that although the
effectiveness of mDPR is much lower than BM25, dense representations
nevertheless appear to provide valuable relevance signals, improving BM25
results in sparse-dense hybrids. In addition to analyses of our results, we
also discuss future challenges and present a research agenda in multi-lingual
dense retrieval. Mr. TyDi can be downloaded at

Transformer-based models to aid their interpretability in cross-lingual and
multi-lingual tasks. Prior research has found that only a few attention heads
are important in each mono-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) task and
pruning the remaining heads leads to comparable or improved performance of the
model. However, the impact of pruning attention heads is not yet clear in
cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show
that (1) pruning a number of attention heads in a multi-lingual
Transformer-based model has, in general, positive effects on its performance in
cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks and (2) the attention heads to be pruned
can be ranked using gradients and identified with a few trial experiments. Our
experiments focus on sequence labeling tasks, with potential applicability on
other cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. For comprehensiveness, we examine
two pre-trained multi-lingual models, namely multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) and
XLM-R, on three tasks across 9 languages each. We also discuss the validity of
our findings and their extensibility to truly resource-scarce languages and
other task settings.</span>

                                        <span>Twitch chats pose a unique problem in natural language understanding due to a
large presence of neologisms, specifically emotes. There are a total of 8.06
million emotes, over 400k of which were used in the week studied. There is
virtually no information on the meaning or sentiment of emotes, and with a
constant influx of new emotes and drift in their frequencies, it becomes
impossible to maintain an updated manually-labeled dataset. Our paper makes a
two fold contribution. First we establish a new baseline for sentiment analysis
on Twitch data, outperforming the previous supervised benchmark by 7.9% points.
Secondly, we introduce a simple but powerful unsupervised framework based on
word embeddings and k-NN to enrich existing models with out-of-vocabulary
knowledge. This framework allows us to auto-generate a pseudo-dictionary of
emotes and we show that we can nearly match the supervised benchmark above even
when injecting such emote knowledge into sentiment classifiers trained on
extraneous datasets such as movie reviews or Twitter.</span>

                                        <span>Conditional masked language models (CMLM) have shown impressive progress in
non-autoregressive machine translation (NAT). They learn the conditional
translation model by predicting the random masked subset in the target
sentence. Based on the CMLM framework, we introduce Multi-view Subset
Regularization (MvSR), a novel regularization method to improve the performance
of the NAT model. Specifically, MvSR consists of two parts: (1) \textit{shared
mask consistency}: we forward the same target with different mask strategies,
and encourage the predictions of shared mask positions to be consistent with
each other. (2) \textit{model consistency}, we maintain an exponential moving
average of the model weights, and enforce the predictions to be consistent
between the average model and the online model. Without changing the CMLM-based
architecture, our approach achieves remarkable performance on three public
benchmarks with 0.36-1.14 BLEU gains over previous NAT models. Moreover,
compared with the stronger Transformer baseline, we reduce the gap to 0.01-0.44
BLEU scores on small datasets (WMT16 RO$\leftrightarrow$EN and IWSLT
DE$\rightarrow$EN).</span>

                                        <span>End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) systems that process
human-human or human-computer interactions are often context independent and
process each turn of a conversation independently. Spoken conversations on the
other hand, are very much context dependent, and dialog history contains useful
information that can improve the processing of each conversational turn. In
this paper, we investigate the importance of dialog history and how it can be
effectively integrated into end-to-end SLU systems. While processing a spoken
utterance, our proposed RNN transducer (RNN-T) based SLU model has access to
its dialog history in the form of decoded transcripts and SLU labels of
previous turns. We encode the dialog history as BERT embeddings, and use them
as an additional input to the SLU model along with the speech features for the
current utterance. We evaluate our approach on a recently released spoken
dialog data set, the HarperValleyBank corpus. We observe significant
improvements: 8% for dialog action and 30% for caller intent recognition tasks,
in comparison to a competitive context independent end-to-end baseline system.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to
identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student&#x27;s performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-label image recognition is a challenging computer vision task of
practical use. Progresses in this area, however, are often characterized by
complicated methods, heavy computations, and lack of intuitive explanations. To
effectively capture different spatial regions occupied by objects from
different categories, we propose an embarrassingly simple module, named
class-specific residual attention (CSRA). CSRA generates class-specific
features for every category by proposing a simple spatial attention score, and
then combines it with the class-agnostic average pooling feature. CSRA achieves
state-of-the-art results on multilabel recognition, and at the same time is
much simpler than them. Furthermore, with only 4 lines of code, CSRA also leads
to consistent improvement across many diverse pretrained models and datasets

                                        <span>Most existing video-and-language (VidL) research focuses on a single dataset,
or multiple datasets of a single task. In reality, a truly useful VidL system
is expected to be easily generalizable to diverse tasks, domains, and datasets.
To facilitate the evaluation of such systems, we introduce Video-And-Language
Understanding Evaluation (VALUE) benchmark, an assemblage of 11 VidL datasets
over 3 popular tasks: (i) text-to-video retrieval; (ii) video question
answering; and (iii) video captioning. VALUE benchmark aims to cover a broad
range of video genres, video lengths, data volumes, and task difficulty levels.
Rather than focusing on single-channel videos with visual information only,
VALUE promotes models that leverage information from both video frames and
their associated subtitles, as well as models that share knowledge across
multiple tasks. We evaluate various baseline methods with and without
large-scale VidL pre-training, and systematically investigate the impact of
video input channels, fusion methods, and different video representations. We
also study the transferability between tasks, and conduct multi-task learning
under different settings. The significant gap between our best model and human
performance calls for future study for advanced VidL models. VALUE is available

perform multi-target tracking (MOT) in real-time on low-end devices. Today&#x27;s
MOT solutions employ deep neural networks, which tend to have high computation
complexity. Recognizing the effects of frame sizes on tracking performance, we
propose DeepScale, a model agnostic frame size selection approach that operates
on top of existing fully convolutional network-based trackers to accelerate
tracking throughput. In the training stage, we incorporate detectability scores
into a one-shot tracker architecture so that DeepScale can learn representation
estimations for different frame sizes in a self-supervised manner. {During
inference, it can adapt frame sizes according to the complexity of visual
contents based on user-controlled parameters.} Extensive experiments and
benchmark tests on MOT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility
of DeepScale. Compared to a state-of-the-art tracker, DeepScale++, a variant of
DeepScale achieves 1.57X accelerated with only moderate degradation (~ 2.3%) in
tracking accuracy on the MOT15 dataset in one configuration.</span>

                                        <span>Identifying unexpected objects on roads in semantic segmentation (e.g.,
identifying dogs on roads) is crucial in safety-critical applications. Existing
approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require
additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an
extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or
lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of
a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among
classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,
the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly
different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying
unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we
propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in
order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of
max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions
from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels
share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our
method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training,
which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation
models. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance on the publicly available Fishyscapes Lost &amp; Found leaderboard with
a large margin. Our code is publicly available at this

                                        <span>Finding shape correspondences can be formulated as an NP-hard quadratic
assignment problem (QAP) that becomes infeasible for shapes with high sampling
density. A promising research direction is to tackle such quadratic
optimization problems over binary variables with quantum annealing, which
allows for some problems a more efficient search in the solution space.
Unfortunately, enforcing the linear equality constraints in QAPs via a penalty
significantly limits the success probability of such methods on currently
available quantum hardware. To address this limitation, this paper proposes
Q-Match, i.e., a new iterative quantum method for QAPs inspired by the
alpha-expansion algorithm, which allows solving problems of an order of
magnitude larger than current quantum methods. It implicitly enforces the QAP
constraints by updating the current estimates in a cyclic fashion. Further,
Q-Match can be applied iteratively, on a subset of well-chosen correspondences,
allowing us to scale to real-world problems. Using the latest quantum annealer,
the D-Wave Advantage, we evaluate the proposed method on a subset of QAPLIB as
well as on isometric shape matching problems from the FAUST dataset.</span>

has mostly been driven by the search for the best performance in terms of
classification accuracy on standardized benchmarks like ImageNet. More
recently, this focus has been expanded by the notion of model robustness, \ie
the generalization abilities of models towards previously unseen changes in the
data distribution. While new benchmarks, like ImageNet-C, have been introduced
to measure robustness properties, we argue that fixed testsets are only able to
capture a small portion of possible data variations and are thus limited and
prone to generate new overfitted solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, we
suggest to estimate the robustness of a model directly from the structure of
its learned feature-space. We introduce robustness indicators which are
obtained via unsupervised clustering of latent representations from a trained
classifier and show very high correlations to the model performance on
corrupted test data.</span>

role in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.
Measuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done
via expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.
To overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine
learning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial
imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which
improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by
how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This
proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon
estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field
measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation
project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite
imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by up to 10-times for tropical
reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and
satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial
imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a
global benchmark between options for carbon measurements.</span>

                                        <span>Scene text erasing, which replaces text regions with reasonable content in
natural images, has drawn significant attention in the computer vision
community in recent years. There are two potential subtasks in scene text
erasing: text detection and image inpainting. Either subtask requires
considerable data to achieve better performance; however, the lack of a
large-scale real-world scene-text removal dataset does not allow existing
methods to work according to their potential. To avoid the limitation of the
lack of pairwise real-world data, we enhance and make considerable use of the
synthetic text and subsequently train our model only on the dataset generated
by the improved synthetic text engine. Our proposed network contains a stroke
mask prediction module and background inpainting module that can extract the
text stroke as a relatively small hole from the cropped text image to maintain
more background content for better inpainting results. This model can partially
erase text instances in a scene image with a bounding box or work with an
existing scene-text detector for automatic scene text erasing. The experimental
results from the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the SCUT-Syn,
ICDAR2013, and SCUT-EnsText datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods even when they were trained on
real-world data.</span>

our &quot;specialize and fuse&quot; process for semantic segmentation. A pyramidal
&quot;output&quot; representation consists of coarse-to-fine levels, where each level is
&quot;specialize&quot; in a different class distribution (e.g., more stuff than things
classes at coarser levels). Two types of pyramidal outputs (i.e., unity and
semantic pyramid) are &quot;fused&quot; into the final semantic output, where the unity
pyramid indicates unity-cells (i.e., all pixels in such cell share the same
semantic label). The process ensures parsimony by predicting a relatively small
number of labels for unity-cells (e.g., a large cell of grass) to build the
final semantic output. In addition to the &quot;output&quot; representation, we design a
coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate the &quot;features&quot; representation

                                        <span>Appearance and motion are two important sources of information in video
object segmentation (VOS). Previous methods mainly focus on using simplex
solutions, lowering the upper bound of feature collaboration among and across
these two cues. In this paper, we study a novel framework, termed the FSNet
(Full-duplex Strategy Network), which designs a relational cross-attention
module (RCAM) to achieve the bidirectional message propagation across embedding
subspaces. Furthermore, the bidirectional purification module (BPM) is
introduced to update the inconsistent features between the spatial-temporal
embeddings, effectively improving the model robustness. By considering the
mutual restraint within the full-duplex strategy, our FSNet performs the
cross-modal feature-passing (i.e., transmission and receiving) simultaneously
before the fusion and decoding stage, making it robust to various challenging
scenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) in VOS. Extensive experiments on five
popular benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS$_{16}$, FBMS, MCL, SegTrack-V2, and
DAVSOD$_{19}$) show that our FSNet outperforms other state-of-the-arts for both

                                        <span>Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. In
this paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in
reinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source
and target point clouds through trial and error. By modeling the point cloud
registration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent
dynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and
evaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new
transformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation
(i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment
precision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as
the reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we
employ the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy
by maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the
optimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point
clouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the
transformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method can yield good registration performance in
an unsupervised manner.</span>

                                        <span>Collecting labeled data for the task of semantic segmentation is expensive
and time-consuming, as it requires dense pixel-level annotations. While recent
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic segmentation approaches have
achieved impressive results by using large amounts of labeled training data,
their performance drops significantly as the amount of labeled data decreases.
This happens because deep CNNs trained with the de facto cross-entropy loss can
easily overfit to small amounts of labeled data. To address this issue, we
propose a simple and effective contrastive learning-based training strategy in
which we first pretrain the network using a pixel-wise, label-based contrastive
loss, and then fine-tune it using the cross-entropy loss. This approach
increases intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby
resulting in a better pixel classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed training strategy using the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
segmentation datasets. Our results show that pretraining with the proposed
contrastive loss results in large performance gains (more than 20% absolute
improvement in some settings) when the amount of labeled data is limited. In
many settings, the proposed contrastive pretraining strategy, which does not
use any additional data, is able to match or outperform the widely-used
ImageNet pretraining strategy that uses more than a million additional labeled
images.</span>

generic, taxonomy-free event boundaries that segment a whole video into chunks.
Conventional work in temporal video segmentation and action detection focuses
on localizing pre-defined action categories and thus does not scale to generic
videos. Cognitive Science has known since last century that humans consistently
segment videos into meaningful temporal chunks. This segmentation happens
naturally, without pre-defined event categories and without being explicitly
asked to do so. Here, we repeat these cognitive experiments on mainstream CV
datasets; with our novel annotation guideline which addresses the complexities
of taxonomy-free event boundary annotation, we introduce the task of Generic
Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) and the new benchmark Kinetics-GEBD. Our
Kinetics-GEBD has the largest number of boundaries (e.g. 32 of ActivityNet, 8
of EPIC-Kitchens-100) which are in-the-wild, taxonomy-free, cover generic event
change, and respect human perception diversity. We view GEBD as an important
stepping stone towards understanding the video as a whole, and believe it has
been previously neglected due to a lack of proper task definition and
annotations. Through experiment and human study we demonstrate the value of the
annotations. Further, we benchmark supervised and un-supervised GEBD approaches
on the TAPOS dataset and our Kinetics-GEBD. We release our annotations and
baseline codes at CVPR&#x27;21 LOVEU Challenge:

                                        <span>Open set recognition (OSR), aiming to simultaneously classify the seen
classes and identify the unseen classes as &#x27;unknown&#x27;, is essential for reliable
machine learning.The key challenge of OSR is how to reduce the empirical
classification risk on the labeled known data and the open space risk on the
potential unknown data simultaneously. To handle the challenge, we formulate
the open space risk problem from the perspective of multi-class integration,
and model the unexploited extra-class space with a novel concept Reciprocal
Point. Follow this, a novel learning framework, termed Adversarial Reciprocal
Point Learning (ARPL), is proposed to minimize the overlap of known
distribution and unknown distributions without loss of known classification
accuracy. Specifically, each reciprocal point is learned by the extra-class
space with the corresponding known category, and the confrontation among
multiple known categories are employed to reduce the empirical classification
risk. Then, an adversarial margin constraint is proposed to reduce the open
space risk by limiting the latent open space constructed by reciprocal points.
To further estimate the unknown distribution from open space, an instantiated
adversarial enhancement method is designed to generate diverse and confusing
training samples, based on the adversarial mechanism between the reciprocal
points and known classes. This can effectively enhance the model
distinguishability to the unknown classes. Extensive experimental results on
various benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method is significantly
superior to other existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.</span>

                                        <span>A myriad of recent breakthroughs in hand-crafted neural architectures for
visual recognition have highlighted the urgent need to explore hybrid
architectures consisting of diversified building blocks. Meanwhile, neural
architecture search methods are surging with an expectation to reduce human
efforts. However, whether NAS methods can efficiently and effectively handle
diversified search spaces with disparate candidates (e.g. CNNs and
transformers) is still an open question. In this work, we present Block-wisely
Self-supervised Neural Architecture Search (BossNAS), an unsupervised NAS
method that addresses the problem of inaccurate architecture rating caused by
large weight-sharing space and biased supervision in previous methods. More
specifically, we factorize the search space into blocks and utilize a novel
self-supervised training scheme, named ensemble bootstrapping, to train each

center. Additionally, we present HyTra search space, a fabric-like hybrid
CNN-transformer search space with searchable down-sampling positions. On this
challenging search space, our searched model, BossNet-T, achieves up to 82.5%
accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing EfficientNet by 2.4% with comparable compute
time. Moreover, our method achieves superior architecture rating accuracy with
0.78 and 0.76 Spearman correlation on the canonical MBConv search space with
ImageNet and on NATS-Bench size search space with CIFAR-100, respectively,
surpassing state-of-the-art NAS methods. Code:

                                        <span>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently gained a surge of interest within
the computer vision community for its power to synthesize photorealistic novel
views of real-world scenes. One limitation of NeRF, however, is its requirement
of accurate camera poses to learn the scene representations. In this paper, we
propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from
imperfect (or even unknown) camera poses -- the joint problem of learning
neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a
theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that
coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show
that na\&quot;ively applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on
registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene
representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time.
This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown
camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g.
SLAM) and potential applications for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.</span>

nearly all language tasks, the large number of tokens (pixels) found in images
coupled with the quadratic activation memory usage makes them prohibitive for
problems in computer vision. As such, while language-to-language translation
has been revolutionized by the transformer model, convolutional networks remain
the de facto solution for image-to-image translation. The recently proposed
MLP-Mixer architecture alleviates some of the computational issues associated
with attention-based networks while still retaining the long-range connections
that make transformer models desirable. Leveraging this memory-efficient
alternative to self-attention, we propose a new exploratory model in unpaired
image-to-image translation called MixerGAN: a simpler MLP-based architecture
that considers long-distance relationships between pixels without the need for
expensive attention mechanisms. Quantitative and qualitative analysis shows
that MixerGAN achieves competitive results when compared to prior
convolutional-based methods.</span>

                                        <span>Modern computer vision applications suffer from catastrophic forgetting when
incrementally learning new concepts over time. The most successful approaches
to alleviate this forgetting require extensive replay of previously seen data,
which is problematic when memory constraints or data legality concerns exist.
In this work, we consider the high-impact problem of Data-Free
Class-Incremental Learning (DFCIL), where an incremental learning agent must
learn new concepts over time without storing generators or training data from
past tasks. One approach for DFCIL is to replay synthetic images produced by
inverting a frozen copy of the learner&#x27;s classification model, but we show this
approach fails for common class-incremental benchmarks when using standard
distillation strategies. We diagnose the cause of this failure and propose a
novel incremental distillation strategy for DFCIL, contributing a modified
cross-entropy training and importance-weighted feature distillation, and show
that our method results in up to a 25.1% increase in final task accuracy
(absolute difference) compared to SOTA DFCIL methods for common
class-incremental benchmarks. Our method even outperforms several standard
replay based methods which store a coreset of images.</span>

                                        <span>Anomalies are ubiquitous in all scientific fields and can express an
unexpected event due to incomplete knowledge about the data distribution or an
unknown process that suddenly comes into play and distorts observations. Due to
such events&#x27; rarity, to train deep learning models on the Anomaly Detection
(AD) task, scientists only rely on &quot;normal&quot; data, i.e., non-anomalous samples.
Thus, letting the neural network infer the distribution beneath the input data.
In such a context, we propose a novel framework, named Multi-layer One-Class
ClassificAtion (MOCCA),to train and test deep learning models on the AD task.
Specifically, we applied it to autoencoders. A key novelty in our work stems
from the explicit optimization of intermediate representations for the AD task.
Indeed, differently from commonly used approaches that consider a neural
network as a single computational block, i.e., using the output of the last
layer only, MOCCA explicitly leverages the multi-layer structure of deep
architectures. Each layer&#x27;s feature space is optimized for AD during training,
while in the test phase, the deep representations extracted from the trained
layers are combined to detect anomalies. With MOCCA, we split the training
process into two steps. First, the autoencoder is trained on the reconstruction
task only. Then, we only retain the encoder tasked with minimizing the L_2
distance between the output representation and a reference point, the
anomaly-free training data centroid, at each considered layer. Subsequently, we
combine the deep features extracted at the various trained layers of the
encoder model to detect anomalies at inference time. To assess the performance
of the models trained with MOCCA, we conduct extensive experiments on publicly
available datasets. We show that our proposed method reaches comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches available in the
literature.</span>

                                        <span>High quality imaging usually requires bulky and expensive lenses to
compensate geometric and chromatic aberrations. This poses high constraints on
the optical hash or low cost applications. Although one can utilize algorithmic
reconstruction to remove the artifacts of low-end lenses, the degeneration from
optical aberrations is spatially varying and the computation has to trade off
efficiency for performance. For example, we need to conduct patch-wise
optimization or train a large set of local deep neural networks to achieve high
reconstruction performance across the whole image. In this paper, we propose a
PSF aware plug-and-play deep network, which takes the aberrant image and PSF
map as input and produces the latent high quality version via incorporating
lens-specific deep priors, thus leading to a universal and flexible optical
aberration correction method. Specifically, we pre-train a base model from a
set of diverse lenses and then adapt it to a given lens by quickly refining the
parameters, which largely alleviates the time and memory consumption of model
learning. The approach is of high efficiency in both training and testing
stages. Extensive results verify the promising applications of our proposed
approach for compact low-end cameras.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks have allowed remarkable advances in single
image super-resolution (SISR) over the last decade. Among recent advances in
SISR, attention mechanisms are crucial for high-performance SR models. However,
the attention mechanism remains unclear on why it works and how it works in
SISR. In this work, we attempt to quantify and visualize attention mechanisms
in SISR and show that not all attention modules are equally beneficial. We then
propose attention in attention network (A$^2$N) for more efficient and accurate
SISR. Specifically, A$^2$N consists of a non-attention branch and a coupling
attention branch. A dynamic attention module is proposed to generate weights
for these two branches to suppress unwanted attention adjustments dynamically,
where the weights change adaptively according to the input features. This
allows attention modules to specialize to beneficial examples without otherwise
penalties and thus greatly improve the capacity of the attention network with
few parameters overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model
A$^2$N could achieve superior trade-off performances comparing with
state-of-the-art networks of similar sizes. Codes are available at

                                        <span>We present Region Similarity Representation Learning (ReSim), a new approach
to self-supervised representation learning for localization-based tasks such as
object detection and segmentation. While existing work has largely focused on
solely learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both
regional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level
representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the
overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas
with their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing
the feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and
semantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional
feature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a
shift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps;
this allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for
localization. Through object detection, instance segmentation, and dense pose
estimation experiments, we illustrate how ReSim learns representations which
significantly improve the localization and classification performance compared
to a competitive MoCo-v2 baseline: $+2.7$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ VOC, $+1.1$
AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ COCO, and $+1.9$ AP$^{\text{mk}}$ Cityscapes. Code and

                                        <span>Class imbalance is an inherent problem in many machine learning
classification tasks. This often leads to trained models that are unusable for
any practical purpose. In this study we explore an unsupervised approach to
address these imbalances by leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained image
classification models to encoder-based Generative Adversarial Network (eGAN).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this problem
using GAN without needing to augment with synthesized fake images.

In the proposed approach we use the discriminator network to output a
negative or positive score. We classify as minority, test samples with negative
scores and as majority those with positive scores. Our approach eliminates
epistemic uncertainty in model predictions, as the P(minority) + P(majority)
need not sum up to 1. The impact of transfer learning and combinations of
different pre-trained image classification models at the generator and
discriminator is also explored. Best result of 0.69 F1-score was obtained on
CIFAR-10 classification task with imbalance ratio of 1:2500.

Our approach also provides a mechanism of thresholding the specificity or
sensitivity of our machine learning system. Keywords: Class imbalance, Transfer

performance on several computer vision tasks. However, the one typical drawback
of these DNNs is the requirement of massive labeled data. Even though few-shot
learning methods address this problem, they often use techniques such as
meta-learning and metric-learning on top of the existing methods. In this work,
we address this problem from a neuroscience perspective by proposing a
hypothesis named Ikshana, which is supported by several findings in
neuroscience. Our hypothesis approximates the refining process of conceptual
gist in the human brain while understanding a natural scene/image. While our
hypothesis holds no particular novelty in neuroscience, it provides a novel
perspective for designing DNNs for vision tasks. By following the Ikshana
hypothesis, we propose a novel neural-inspired CNN architecture named
IkshanaNet. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
by outperforming several baselines on the entire and subsets of the Cityscapes

Adaption framework for sketch-to-photo synthesis. The unsupervised open domain
adaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is
challenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The
absence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the
freehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that
learns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the
missing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between
synthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings
may produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking
classes. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain
sampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering
false drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo
and photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On
the Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most
current competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model
outperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and
retaining the structural layout.</span>

                                        <span>The growing number of action classes has posed a new challenge for video
understanding, making Zero-Shot Action Recognition (ZSAR) a thriving direction.
The ZSAR task aims to recognize target (unseen) actions without training
examples by leveraging semantic representations to bridge seen and unseen
actions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of actions, it remains
challenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge
from seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by
an effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves
elaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we
expand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is
more discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined
attributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we
incorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve
video semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our
ER-enhanced ZSAR model achieves state-of-the-art results on three existing
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a new ZSAR evaluation protocol on the Kinetics
dataset to overcome limitations of current benchmarks and demonstrate the first
case where ZSAR performance is comparable to few-shot learning baselines on
this more realistic setting. We will release our codes and collected EDs at

recognition models. Despite this bottleneck, community&#x27;s efforts seem to be
invested only in coming up with novel architectures. To specifically address
this bottleneck, we introduce two new pose based human action datasets -

the model performance on a budget. One such algorithm is Expected Gradient
Length, which as the name suggests uses the approximate gradient induced per
example in the sampling process. While Expected Gradient Length has been
successfully used for classification and regression, the formulation for
regression remains intuitively driven. Hence, our theoretical contribution
involves deriving this formulation, thereby supporting the experimental
evidence. Subsequently, we show that expected gradient length in regression is
equivalent to Bayesian uncertainty. If certain assumptions are infeasible, our
algorithmic contribution (EGL++) approximates the effect of ensembles with a
single deterministic network. Instead of computing multiple possible inferences
per input, we leverage previously annotated samples to quantify the probability
of previous labels being the true label. Such an approach allows us to extend
expected gradient length to a new task: human pose estimation. We perform
experimental validation on two human pose datasets (MPII and LSP/LSPET),
highlighting the interpretability and competitiveness of EGL++ with different
active learning algorithms for human pose estimation.</span>

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)
action recognition. However, TAL poses a unique set of challenges. In this
paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the
best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly consider audio and
video modalities for supervised TAL. We experimentally show that our schemes
consistently improve performance for state of the art video-only TAL
approaches. Specifically, they help achieve new state of the art performance on
large-scale benchmark datasets - ActivityNet-1.3 (54.34 mAP@0.5) and THUMOS14
(57.18 mAP@0.5). Our experiments include ablations involving multiple fusion
schemes, modality combinations and TAL architectures. Our code, models and

                                        <span>Transformer networks have proven extremely powerful for a wide variety of
tasks since they were introduced. Computer vision is not an exception, as the
use of transformers has become very popular in the vision community in recent
years. Despite this wave, multiple-object tracking (MOT) exhibits for now some
sort of incompatibility with transformers. We argue that the standard
representation - bounding boxes with insufficient sparse queries - is not
optimal to learning transformers for MOT. Inspired by recent research, we
propose TransCenter, the first transformer-based MOT architecture for dense
heatmap predictions. Methodologically, we propose the use of dense pixel-level
multi-scale queries in a transformer dual-decoder network, to be able to
globally and robustly infer the heatmap of targets&#x27; centers and associate them
through time. TransCenter outperforms the current state-of-the-art in standard
benchmarks both in MOT17 and MOT20. Our ablation study demonstrates the
advantage in the proposed architecture compared to more naive alternatives. The

temporal consistency by conditioning on neighboring frames. However for
transfer from simulated to photorealistic sequences, available information on
the underlying geometry offers potential for achieving global consistency
across views. We propose a novel approach which combines unpaired image
translation with neural rendering to transfer simulated to photorealistic
surgical abdominal scenes. By introducing global learnable textures and a
lighting-invariant view-consistency loss, our method produces consistent
translations of arbitrary views and thus enables long-term consistent video
synthesis. We design and test our model to generate video sequences from
minimally-invasive surgical abdominal scenes. Because labeled data is often
limited in this domain, photorealistic data where ground truth information from
the simulated domain is preserved is especially relevant. By extending existing
image-based methods to view-consistent videos, we aim to impact the
applicability of simulated training and evaluation environments for surgical
applications. Code and data: this http URL</span>

raw data is extremely challenging. Modern video question answering (VideoQA)
systems often use additional human-made sources like plot synopses, scripts,
video descriptions or knowledge bases. In this work, we present a new approach
to understand the whole story without such external sources. The secret lies in
the dialog: unlike any prior work, we treat dialog as a noisy source to be
converted into text description via dialog summarization, much like recent
methods treat video. The input of each modality is encoded by transformers
independently, and a simple fusion method combines all modalities, using soft
temporal attention for localization over long inputs. Our model outperforms the
state of the art on the KnowIT VQA dataset by a large margin, without using
question-specific human annotation or human-made plot summaries. It even
outperforms human evaluators who have never watched any whole episode before.

and thus an effective motion representation is required for video understanding
in the wild. In this paper, we propose a rich and robust motion representation
based on spatio-temporal self-similarity (STSS). Given a sequence of frames,
STSS represents each local region as similarities to its neighbors in space and
time. By converting appearance features into relational values, it enables the
learner to better recognize structural patterns in space and time. We leverage
the whole volume of STSS and let our model learn to extract an effective motion
representation from it. The proposed neural block, dubbed SELFY, can be easily
inserted into neural architectures and trained end-to-end without additional
supervision. With a sufficient volume of the neighborhood in space and time, it
effectively captures long-term interaction and fast motion in the video,
leading to robust action recognition. Our experimental analysis demonstrates
its superiority over previous methods for motion modeling as well as its
complementarity to spatio-temporal features from direct convolution. On the
standard action recognition benchmarks, Something-Something-V1 &amp; V2, Diving-48,
and FineGym, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results.</span>

their fast convergence and low training complexity. However, existing
proxy-based losses focus on learning class-discriminative features while
overlooking the commonalities shared across classes which are potentially
useful in describing and matching samples. Moreover, they ignore the implicit
hierarchy of categories in real-world datasets, where similar subordinate
classes can be grouped together. In this paper, we present a framework that
leverages this implicit hierarchy by imposing a hierarchical structure on the
proxies and can be used with any existing proxy-based loss. This allows our
model to capture both class-discriminative features and class-shared
characteristics without breaking the implicit data hierarchy. We evaluate our
method on five established image retrieval datasets such as In-Shop and SOP.
Results demonstrate that our hierarchical proxy-based loss framework improves
the performance of existing proxy-based losses, especially on large datasets
which exhibit strong hierarchical structure.</span>

                                        <span>We present RePOSE, a fast iterative refinement method for 6D object pose
estimation. Prior methods perform refinement by feeding zoomed-in input and
rendered RGB images into a CNN and directly regressing an update of a refined
pose. Their runtime is slow due to the computational cost of CNN, which is
especially prominent in multiple-object pose refinement. To overcome this
problem, RePOSE leverages image rendering for fast feature extraction using a
3D model with a learnable texture. We call this deep texture rendering, which
uses a shallow multi-layer perceptron to directly regress a view-invariant
image representation of an object. Furthermore, we utilize differentiable
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization to refine a pose fast and accurately by
minimizing the feature-metric error between the input and rendered image
representations without the need of zooming in. These image representations are
trained such that differentiable LM optimization converges within few
iterations. Consequently, RePOSE runs at 92 FPS and achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy of 51.6% on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset - a 4.1% absolute
improvement over the prior art, and comparable result on the YCB-Video dataset
with a much faster runtime. The code is available at

                                        <span>Temporal action proposal generation is an important and challenging task in
video understanding, which aims at detecting all temporal segments containing
action instances of interest. The existing proposal generation approaches are
generally based on pre-defined anchor windows or heuristic bottom-up boundary
matching strategies. This paper presents a simple and efficient framework
(RTD-Net) for direct action proposal generation, by re-purposing a
Transformer-alike architecture. To tackle the essential visual difference
between time and space, we make three important improvements over the original
transformer detection framework (DETR). First, to deal with slowness prior in
videos, we replace the original Transformer encoder with a boundary attentive
module to better capture long-range temporal information. Second, due to the
ambiguous temporal boundary and relatively sparse annotations, we present a
relaxed matching scheme to relieve the strict criteria of single assignment to
each groundtruth. Finally, we devise a three-branch head to further improve the
proposal confidence estimation by explicitly predicting its completeness.
Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of RTD-Net, on both tasks of temporal action proposal
generation and temporal action detection. Moreover, due to its simplicity in
design, our framework is more efficient than previous proposal generation
methods, without non-maximum suppression post-processing. The code and models
are made available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/RTD-Action.</span>

                                        <span>Learning in a low-data regime from only a few labeled examples is an
important, but challenging problem. Recent advancements within meta-learning
have demonstrated encouraging performance, in particular, for the task of
few-shot classification. We propose a novel optimization-based meta-learning
approach for few-shot classification. It consists of an embedding network,
providing a general representation of the image, and a base learner module. The
latter learns a linear classifier during the inference through an unrolled
optimization procedure. We design an inner learning objective composed of (i) a
robust classification loss on the support set and (ii) an entropy loss,
allowing transductive learning from unlabeled query samples. By employing an
efficient initialization module and a Steepest Descent based optimization
algorithm, our base learner predicts a powerful classifier within only a few
iterations. Further, our strategy enables important aspects of the base learner
objective to be learned during meta-training. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to integrate both induction and transduction into the
base learner in an optimization-based meta-learning framework. We perform a
comprehensive experimental analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach on four few-shot classification datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have developed to become powerful models
for various computer vision tasks ranging from object detection to semantic
segmentation. However, most of the state-of-the-art CNNs cannot be deployed
directly on edge devices such as smartphones and drones, which need low latency
under limited power and memory bandwidth. One popular, straightforward approach
to compressing CNNs is network slimming, which imposes $\ell_1$ regularization
on the channel-associated scaling factors via the batch normalization layers
during training. Network slimming thereby identifies insignificant channels
that can be pruned for inference. In this paper, we propose replacing the
$\ell_1$ penalty with an alternative nonconvex, sparsity-inducing penalty in
order to yield a more compressed and/or accurate CNN architecture. We
investigate $\ell_p (0 &lt; p &lt; 1)$, transformed $\ell_1$ (T$\ell_1$), minimax
concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) due to
their recent successes and popularity in solving sparse optimization problems,
such as compressed sensing and variable selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of network slimming with nonconvex penalties on three neural
network architectures -- VGG-19, DenseNet-40, and ResNet-164 -- on standard
image classification datasets. Based on the numerical experiments, T$\ell_1$
preserves model accuracy against channel pruning, $\ell_{1/2, 3/4}$ yield
better compressed models with similar accuracies after retraining as $\ell_1$,
and MCP and SCAD provide more accurate models after retraining with similar
compression as $\ell_1$. Network slimming with T$\ell_1$ regularization also
outperforms the latest Bayesian modification of network slimming in compressing
a CNN architecture in terms of memory storage while preserving its model
accuracy after channel pruning.</span>

                                        <span>Deeper and wider CNNs are known to provide improved performance for deep
learning tasks. However, most such networks have poor performance gain per
parameter increase. In this paper, we investigate whether the gain observed in
deeper models is purely due to the addition of more optimization parameters or
whether the physical size of the network as well plays a role. Further, we
present a novel rescaling strategy for CNNs based on learnable repetition of
its parameters. Based on this strategy, we rescale CNNs without changing their
parameter count, and show that learnable sharing of weights itself can provide
significant boost in the performance of any given model without changing its
parameter count. We show that small base networks when rescaled, can provide
performance comparable to deeper networks with as low as 6% of optimization
parameters of the deeper one.

The relevance of weight sharing is further highlighted through the example of
group-equivariant CNNs. We show that the significant improvements obtained with
group-equivariant CNNs over the regular CNNs on classification problems are
only partly due to the added equivariance property, and part of it comes from
the learnable repetition of network weights. For rot-MNIST dataset, we show
that up to 40% of the relative gain reported by state-of-the-art methods for
rotation equivariance could actually be due to just the learnt repetition of
weights.</span>

of supervised deep learning, especially when real data are difficult to acquire
or hard to annotate. Synthetic data generation, however, can itself be
prohibitively expensive when domain experts have to manually and painstakingly
oversee the process. Moreover, neural networks trained on synthetic data often
do not perform well on real data because of the domain gap. To solve these
challenges, we propose Sim2SG, a self-supervised automatic scene generation
technique for matching the distribution of real data. Importantly, Sim2SG does
not require supervision from the real-world dataset, thus making it applicable
in situations for which such annotations are difficult to obtain. Sim2SG is
designed to bridge both the content and appearance gaps, by matching the
content of real data, and by matching the features in the source and target
domains. We select scene graph (SG) generation as the downstream task, due to
the limited availability of labeled datasets. Experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over leading baselines in reducing the domain gap both

                                        <span>From CNNs to attention mechanisms, encoding inductive biases into neural
networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.</span>

sequence is a challenging problem that receives considerable attentions
recently. In this paper, we address this problem with the aid of neural scene
representation networks. Our method is completely different from existing
methods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D face
models to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically,
the feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicit
function to generate a dynamic neural radiance field, from which a
high-fidelity talking-head video corresponding to the audio signal is
synthesized using volume rendering. Another advantage of our framework is that
not only the head (with hair) region is synthesized as previous methods did,
but also the upper body is generated via two individual neural radiance fields.
Experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) produce
high-fidelity and natural results, and (2) support free adjustment of audio
signals, viewing directions, and background images. Code is available at

multifilter design and makes it possible to have several useful properties such

at localizing and recognizing interactions between humans and objects. Existing
works focus on the visual and linguistic features of humans and objects.
However, they do not capitalise on the high-level and semantic relationships
present in the image, which provides crucial contextual and detailed relational
knowledge for HOI inference. We propose a novel method to exploit this
information, through the scene graph, for the Human-Object Interaction (SG2HOI)
detection task. Our method, SG2HOI, incorporates the SG information in two
ways: (1) we embed a scene graph into a global context clue, serving as the
scene-specific environmental context; and (2) we build a relation-aware
message-passing module to gather relationships from objects&#x27; neighborhood and
transfer them into interactions. Empirical evaluation shows that our SG2HOI
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark HOI datasets:
V-COCO and HICO-DET. Code will be available at https://github.com/ht014/SG2HOI.</span>

in closed form. The corresponding orthogonal multiwavelet function is derived
using algebraic techniques which allow symmetry to be considered. This leads to

reflection removal method. Our network has a reflection detection module to
regress a probabilistic reflection confidence map, taking multi-scale Laplacian
features as inputs. This probabilistic map tells if a region is
reflection-dominated or transmission-dominated, and it is used as a cue for the
network to control the feature flow when predicting the reflection and
transmission layers. We design our network as a recurrent network to
progressively refine reflection removal results at each iteration. The novelty
is that we leverage Laplacian kernel parameters to emphasize the boundaries of
strong reflections. It is beneficial to strong reflection detection and
substantially improves the quality of reflection removal results. Extensive
experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed method over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and the pre-trained model can be found at

accuracy without annotated training data. However, existing approaches
predominantly rely on restrictive assumptions on appearance and motion. For
scenes with dynamic activities and camera motion, we propose a multi-camera
framework in which geometric constraints are embedded in the form of multi-view
consistency during training via coarse 3D localization in a voxel grid and
fine-grained offset regression. In this manner, we learn a joint distribution
of proposals over multiple views. At inference time, our method operates on
single RGB images. We outperform state-of-the-art techniques both on images

grounding the textual query in an untrimmed video. These works assume that the
relevant video is already known and attempt to localize the moment on that
relevant video only. Different from such works, we relax this assumption and
address the task of localizing moments in a corpus of videos for a given
sentence query. This task poses a unique challenge as the system is required to
perform: (i) retrieval of the relevant video where only a segment of the video
corresponds with the queried sentence, and (ii) temporal localization of moment
in the relevant video based on sentence query. Towards overcoming this
challenge, we propose Hierarchical Moment Alignment Network (HMAN) which learns
an effective joint embedding space for moments and sentences. In addition to
learning subtle differences between intra-video moments, HMAN focuses on
distinguishing inter-video global semantic concepts based on sentence queries.
Qualitative and quantitative results on three benchmark text-based video moment
retrieval datasets - Charades-STA, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions -
demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance on the proposed task
of temporal localization of moments in a corpus of videos.</span>

human motion capture and object trajectory estimation from monocular RGB
videos. We focus on scenes with objects partially observed during a free
flight. In contrast to existing monocular methods, we can recover scale, object
trajectories as well as human bone lengths in meters and the ground plane&#x27;s
orientation, thanks to the awareness of the gravity constraining object
motions. Our objective function is parametrised by the object&#x27;s initial
velocity and position, gravity direction and focal length, and jointly
optimised for one or several free flight episodes. The proposed human-object
interaction constraints ensure geometric consistency of the 3D reconstructions
and improved physical plausibility of human poses compared to the unconstrained
case. We evaluate GraviCap on a new dataset with ground-truth annotations for
persons and different objects undergoing free flights. In the experiments, our
approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D human motion capture on
various metrics. We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video. Both the

                                        <span>Point clouds captured in real-world applications are often incomplete due to
the limited sensor resolution, single viewpoint, and occlusion. Therefore,
recovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable
task in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method
that reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem
and design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder
architecture for point cloud completion. By representing the point cloud as a
set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the
point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for
point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the
inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise
a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships
explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn
structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud
completion. Furthermore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with more
diverse incomplete point clouds that can better reflect the real-world
scenarios to promote future research. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both the new
benchmarks and the existing ones. Code is available at

                                        <span>In video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries, successful procedures of nodule
resection are highly dependent on the precise estimation of lung deformation
between the inflated lung in the computed tomography (CT) images during
preoperative planning and the deflated lung in the treatment views during
surgery. Lungs in the pneumothorax state during surgery have a large volume
change from normal lungs, making it difficult to build a mechanical model. The
purpose of this study is to develop a deformation estimation method of the 3D
surface of a deflated lung from a few partial observations. To estimate
deformations for a largely deformed lung, a kernel regression-based solution
was introduced. The proposed method used a few landmarks to capture the partial
deformation between the 3D surface mesh obtained from preoperative CT and the
intraoperative anatomical positions. The deformation for each vertex of the
entire mesh model was estimated per-vertex as a relative position from the
landmarks. The landmarks were placed in the anatomical position of the lung&#x27;s
outer contour. The method was applied on nine datasets of the left lungs of
live Beagle dogs. Contrast-enhanced CT images of the lungs were acquired. The
proposed method achieved a local positional error of vertices of 2.74 mm,
Hausdorff distance of 6.11 mm, and Dice similarity coefficient of 0.94.
Moreover, the proposed method could estimate lung deformations from a small
number of training cases and a small observation area. This study contributes
to the data-driven modeling of pneumothorax deformation of the lung.</span>

tracking annotations. This is important as large-scale training data is
essential for training deep neural trackers while tracking annotations are
expensive to acquire. In place of tracking annotations, we first hallucinate
videos from images with bounding box annotations using zoom-in/out motion
transformations to obtain free tracking labels. We add video simulation
augmentations to create a diverse tracking dataset, albeit with simple motion.
Next, to tackle harder tracking cases, we mine hard examples across an
unlabeled pool of real videos with a tracker trained on our hallucinated video
data. For hard example mining, we propose an optimization-based connecting
process to first identify and then rectify hard examples from the pool of
unlabeled videos. Finally, we train our tracker jointly on hallucinated data
and mined hard video examples. Our weakly supervised tracker achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the MOT17 and TAO-person datasets. On MOT17, we
further demonstrate that the combination of our self-generated data and the
existing manually-annotated data leads to additional improvements.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been tremendously successful in
solving imaging inverse problems. To understand their success, an effective
strategy is to construct simpler and mathematically more tractable
convolutional sparse coding (CSC) models that share essential ingredients with
CNNs. Existing CSC methods, however, underperform leading CNNs in challenging
inverse problems. We hypothesize that the performance gap may be attributed in
part to how they process images at different spatial scales: While many CNNs
use multiscale feature representations, existing CSC models mostly rely on
single-scale dictionaries. To close the performance gap, we thus propose a
multiscale convolutional dictionary structure. The proposed dictionary
structure is derived from the U-Net, arguably the most versatile and widely
used CNN for image-to-image learning problems. We show that incorporating the
proposed multiscale dictionary in an otherwise standard CSC framework yields
performance competitive with state-of-the-art CNNs across a range of
challenging inverse problems including CT and MRI reconstruction. Our work thus
demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of the multiscale CSC approach
in solving challenging inverse problems.</span>

                                        <span>Cancers are the leading cause of death in many countries. Early diagnosis
plays a crucial role in having proper treatment for this debilitating disease.
The automated classification of the type of cancer is a challenging task since
pathologists must examine a huge number of histopathological images to detect
infinitesimal abnormalities. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture composed of a Concatenation of multiple
Networks, called C-Net, to classify biomedical images. The model incorporates
multiple CNNs including Outer, Middle, and Inner. The first two parts of the
architecture contain six networks that serve as feature extractors to feed into
the Inner network to classify the images in terms of malignancy and benignancy.
The C-Net is applied for histopathological image classification on two public
datasets, including BreakHis and Osteosarcoma. To evaluate the performance, the
model is tested using several evaluation metrics for its reliability. The C-Net
model outperforms all other models on the individual metrics for both datasets
and achieves zero misclassification. This approach has the potential to be
extended to additional classification tasks, as experimental results
demonstrate utilizing extensive evaluation metrics.</span>

recent years. It learns the model from collections of few-shot classification
tasks, which is believed to have a key advantage of making the training
objective consistent with the testing objective. However, some recent works
report that by training for whole-classification, i.e. classification on the
whole label-set, it can get comparable or even better embedding than many
meta-learning algorithms. The edge between these two lines of works has yet
been underexplored, and the effectiveness of meta-learning in few-shot learning
remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a simple process: meta-learning over
a whole-classification pre-trained model on its evaluation metric. We observe
this simple method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods
on standard benchmarks. Our further analysis shed some light on understanding

multi-view stereo techniques rely on two distinct stages: local depth maps
computation and global depth maps fusion. Recent studies concentrate on deep
neural architectures for depth estimation by using conventional depth fusion
method or direct 3D reconstruction network by regressing Truncated Signed
Distance Function (TSDF). In this paper, we advocate that replicating the
traditional two stages framework with deep neural networks improves both the
interpretability and the accuracy of the results. As mentioned, our network
operates in two steps: 1) the local computation of the local depth maps with a
deep MVS technique, and, 2) the depth maps and images&#x27; features fusion to build
a single TSDF volume. In order to improve the matching performance between
images acquired from very different viewpoints (e.g., large-baseline and
rotations), we introduce a rotation-invariant 3D convolution kernel called
PosedConv. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is underlined via a
large series of experiments conducted on the ScanNet dataset where our approach
compares favorably against both traditional and deep learning techniques.</span>

orientation of unseen object instances, is fundamental to many scenarios such
as robotic manipulation and augmented reality, yet still remains unsolved.
Precisely recovering instance 3D model in the canonical space and accurately
matching it with the observation is an essential point when estimating 6D pose
for unseen objects. In this paper, we achieve accurate category-level 6D pose
estimation via cascaded relation and recurrent reconstruction networks.
Specifically, a novel cascaded relation network is dedicated for advanced
representation learning to explore the complex and informative relations among
instance RGB image, instance point cloud and category shape prior. Furthermore,
we design a recurrent reconstruction network for iterative residual refinement
to progressively improve the reconstruction and correspondence estimations from
coarse to fine. Finally, the instance 6D pose is obtained leveraging the
estimated dense correspondences between the instance point cloud and the
reconstructed 3D model in the canonical space. We have conducted extensive
experiments on two well-acknowledged benchmarks of category-level 6D pose
estimation, with significant performance improvement over existing approaches.
On the representatively strict evaluation metrics of $3D_{75}$ and $5^{\circ}2
cm$, our method exceeds the latest state-of-the-art SPD by $4.9\%$ and $17.7\%$
on the CAMERA25 dataset, and by $2.7\%$ and $8.5\%$ on the REAL275 dataset.

entailment is a large, real-world dataset for fine-grained multimodal
reasoning. However, the automatic way in which SNLI-VE has been assembled (via
combining parts of two related datasets) gives rise to a large number of errors
in the labels of this corpus. In this paper, we first present a data collection
effort to correct the class with the highest error rate in SNLI-VE. Secondly,
we re-evaluate an existing model on the corrected corpus, which we call
SNLI-VE-2.0, and provide a quantitative comparison with its performance on the
non-corrected corpus. Thirdly, we introduce e-SNLI-VE, which appends
human-written natural language explanations to SNLI-VE-2.0. Finally, we train
models that learn from these explanations at training time, and output such
explanations at testing time.</span>

source domain to a new target domain with only unlabeled data. Most existing
methods suffer from noticeable negative transfer resulting from either the
error-prone discriminator network or the unreasonable teacher model. Besides,
the local regional consistency in UDA has been largely neglected, and only
extracting the global-level pattern information is not powerful enough for
feature alignment due to the abuse use of contexts. To this end, we propose an
uncertainty-aware consistency regularization method for cross-domain semantic
segmentation. Firstly, we introduce an uncertainty-guided consistency loss with
a dynamic weighting scheme by exploiting the latent uncertainty information of
the target samples. As such, more meaningful and reliable knowledge from the
teacher model can be transferred to the student model. We further reveal the
reason why the current consistency regularization is often unstable in
minimizing the domain discrepancy. Besides, we design a ClassDrop mask
generation algorithm to produce strong class-wise perturbations. Guided by this
mask, we propose a ClassOut strategy to realize effective regional consistency
in a fine-grained manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on four domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., GTAV

generative models. In this work, we present a generative model with
auto-encoder architecture for per-region style manipulation. We apply a code
consistency loss to enforce an explicit disentanglement between content and
style latent representations, making the content and style of generated samples
consistent with their corresponding content and style references. The model is
also constrained by a content alignment loss to ensure the foreground editing
will not interfere background contents. As a result, given interested region
masks provided by users, our model supports foreground region-wise style
transfer. Specially, our model receives no extra annotations such as semantic
labels except for self-supervision. Extensive experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed method and exhibit the flexibility of the
proposed model for various applications, including region-wise style editing,
latent space interpolation, cross-domain style transfer.</span>

people in clothing as a function of the body pose. Given a sequence of scans of
a subject in various poses, we learn to animate the character for new poses.
Existing methods have relied on template-based representations of the human
body (or clothing). However such models usually have fixed and limited
resolutions, require difficult data pre-processing steps and cannot be used
with complex clothing. We draw inspiration from template-based methods, which
factorize motion into articulation and non-rigid deformation, but generalize
this concept for implicit shape learning to obtain a more flexible model. We
learn to map every point in the space to a canonical space, where a learned
deformation field is applied to model non-rigid effects, before evaluating the
signed distance field. Our formulation allows the learning of complex and
non-rigid deformations of clothing and soft tissue, without computing a
template registration as it is common with current approaches. Neural-GIF can
be trained on raw 3D scans and reconstructs detailed complex surface geometry
and deformations. Moreover, the model can generalize to new poses. We evaluate
our method on a variety of characters from different public datasets in diverse
clothing styles and show significant improvements over baseline methods,
quantitatively and qualitatively. We also extend our model to multiple shape
setting. To stimulate further research, we will make the model, code and data

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have so far been the de-facto model for
visual data. Recent work has shown that (Vision) Transformer models (ViT) can
achieve comparable or even superior performance on image classification tasks.
This raises a central question: how are Vision Transformers solving these
tasks? Are they acting like convolutional networks, or learning entirely
different visual representations? Analyzing the internal representation
structure of ViTs and CNNs on image classification benchmarks, we find striking
differences between the two architectures, such as ViT having more uniform
representations across all layers. We explore how these differences arise,
finding crucial roles played by self-attention, which enables early aggregation
of global information, and ViT residual connections, which strongly propagate
features from lower to higher layers. We study the ramifications for spatial
localization, demonstrating ViTs successfully preserve input spatial
information, with noticeable effects from different classification methods.
Finally, we study the effect of (pretraining) dataset scale on intermediate
features and transfer learning, and conclude with a discussion on connections
to new architectures such as the MLP-Mixer.</span>

vision. Targeting towards high accuracy and efficiency, we propose Seeded Graph
Matching Network, a graph neural network with sparse structure to reduce
redundant connectivity and learn compact representation. The network consists
of 1) Seeding Module, which initializes the matching by generating a small set
of reliable matches as seeds. 2) Seeded Graph Neural Network, which utilizes
seed matches to pass messages within/across images and predicts assignment
costs. Three novel operations are proposed as basic elements for message
passing: 1) Attentional Pooling, which aggregates keypoint features within the
image to seed matches. 2) Seed Filtering, which enhances seed features and
exchanges messages across images. 3) Attentional Unpooling, which propagates
seed features back to original keypoints. Experiments show that our method
reduces computational and memory complexity significantly compared with typical
attention-based networks while competitive or higher performance is achieved.</span>

                                        <span>Attention module does not always help deep models learn causal features that
are robust in any confounding context, e.g., a foreground object feature is
invariant to different backgrounds. This is because the confounders trick the
attention to capture spurious correlations that benefit the prediction when the
training and testing data are IID (identical &amp; independent distribution); while
harm the prediction when the data are OOD (out-of-distribution). The sole
fundamental solution to learn causal attention is by causal intervention, which
requires additional annotations of the confounders, e.g., a &quot;dog&quot; model is
learned within &quot;grass+dog&quot; and &quot;road+dog&quot; respectively, so the &quot;grass&quot; and
&quot;road&quot; contexts will no longer confound the &quot;dog&quot; recognition. However, such
annotation is not only prohibitively expensive, but also inherently
problematic, as the confounders are elusive in nature. In this paper, we
propose a causal attention module (CaaM) that self-annotates the confounders in
unsupervised fashion. In particular, multiple CaaMs can be stacked and
integrated in conventional attention CNN and self-attention Vision Transformer.
In OOD settings, deep models with CaaM outperform those without it
significantly; even in IID settings, the attention localization is also
improved by CaaM, showing a great potential in applications that require robust
visual saliency. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Wangt-CN/CaaM}.</span>

                                        <span>For a given video-based Human-Object Interaction scene, modeling the
spatio-temporal relationship between humans and objects are the important cue
to understand the contextual information presented in the video. With the
effective spatio-temporal relationship modeling, it is possible not only to
uncover contextual information in each frame but also to directly capture
inter-time dependencies. It is more critical to capture the position changes of
human and objects over the spatio-temporal dimension when their appearance
features may not show up significant changes over time. The full use of
appearance features, the spatial location and the semantic information are also
the key to improve the video-based Human-Object Interaction recognition
performance. In this paper, Spatio-Temporal Interaction Graph Parsing Networks
(STIGPN) are constructed, which encode the videos with a graph composed of
human and object nodes. These nodes are connected by two types of relations:
(i) spatial relations modeling the interactions between human and the
interacted objects within each frame. (ii) inter-time relations capturing the
long range dependencies between human and the interacted objects across frame.
With the graph, STIGPN learn spatio-temporal features directly from the whole
video-based Human-Object Interaction scenes. Multi-modal features and a
multi-stream fusion strategy are used to enhance the reasoning capability of
STIGPN. Two Human-Object Interaction video datasets, including CAD-120 and
Something-Else, are used to evaluate the proposed architectures, and the
state-of-the-art performance demonstrates the superiority of STIGPN.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has been widely studied, owing to
its practical importance and recent promising improvements. However, most works
suffer from limited supervision of photometric consistency, especially in weak
texture regions and at object boundaries. To overcome this weakness, we propose
novel ideas to improve self-supervised monocular depth estimation by leveraging
cross-domain information, especially scene semantics. We focus on incorporating
implicit semantic knowledge into geometric representation enhancement and
suggest two ideas: a metric learning approach that exploits the
semantics-guided local geometry to optimize intermediate depth representations
and a novel feature fusion module that judiciously utilizes cross-modality
between two heterogeneous feature representations. We comprehensively evaluate
our methods on the KITTI dataset and demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at

                                        <span>We address the challenging task of few-shot segmentation in this work. It is
essential for few-shot semantic segmentation to fully utilize the support
information. Previous methods typically adapt masked average pooling over the
support feature to extract the support clues as a global vector, usually
dominated by the salient part and loses some important clues. In this work, we
argue that every support pixel&#x27;s information is desired to be transferred to
all query pixels and propose a Correspondence Matching Network (CMNet) with an
Optimal Transport Matching module to mine out the correspondence between the
query and support images. Besides, it is important to fully utilize both local
and global information from the annotated support images. To this end, we
propose a Message Flow module to propagate the message along the inner-flow
within the same image and cross-flow between support and query images, which
greatly help enhance the local feature representations. We further address the
few-shot segmentation as a multi-task learning problem to alleviate the domain
gap issue between different datasets. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, MS COCO,
and FSS-1000 datasets show that our network achieves new state-of-the-art
few-shot segmentation performance.</span>

                                        <span>Pushing is a fundamental robotic skill. Existing work has shown how to
exploit models of pushing to achieve a variety of tasks, including grasping
under uncertainty, in-hand manipulation and clearing clutter. Such models,
however, are approximate, which limits their applicability. Learning-based
methods can reason directly from raw sensory data with accuracy, and have the
potential to generalize to a wider diversity of scenarios. However, developing
and testing such methods requires rich-enough datasets. In this paper we
introduce Omnipush, a dataset with high variety of planar pushing behavior. In
particular, we provide 250 pushes for each of 250 objects, all recorded with
RGB-D and a high precision tracking system. The objects are constructed so as
to systematically explore key factors that affect pushing -- the shape of the
object and its mass distribution -- which have not been broadly explored in
previous datasets, and allow to study generalization in model learning.
Omnipush includes a benchmark for meta-learning dynamic models, which requires
algorithms that make good predictions and estimate their own uncertainty. We
also provide an RGB video prediction benchmark and propose other relevant tasks
that can be suited with this dataset.

turbine blade surface damage detection is proposed. Turbine blade(s) which
carry approximately one-third of a turbine weight are susceptible to damage and
can cause sudden malfunction of a grid-connected wind energy conversion system.
The surface damage detection of wind turbine blade requires a large dataset so
as to detect a type of damage at an early stage. Turbine blade images are
captured via aerial imagery. Upon inspection, it is found that the image
dataset was limited and hence image augmentation is applied to improve blade
image dataset. The approach is modeled as a multi-class supervised learning
problem and deep learning methods like Convolutional neural network (CNN),
VGG16-RCNN and AlexNet are tested for determining the potential capability of
turbine blade surface damage.</span>

intelligence applications, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics
and autonomous driving. To accomplish this task, we propose an integrated
visual re-localization method called RLOCS by combining image retrieval,
semantic consistency and geometry verification to achieve accurate estimations.
The localization pipeline is designed as a coarse-to-fine paradigm. In the
retrieval part, we cascade the architecture of ResNet101-GeM-ArcFace and employ
DBSCAN followed by spatial verification to obtain a better initial coarse pose.
We design a module called observation constraints, which combines geometry
information and semantic consistency for filtering outliers. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on open datasets, including retrieval on R-Oxford5k
and R-Paris6k, semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, localization on Aachen
Day-Night and InLoc. By creatively modifying separate modules in the total

scene graph generation (SGG) models solely use the limited annotated relation
triples for training, leading to their underperformance on low-shot (few and
zero) scenarios, especially on the rare predicates. To address this problem, we
propose a novel semantic compositional learning strategy that makes it possible
to construct additional, realistic relation triples with objects from different
images. Specifically, our strategy decomposes a relation triple by identifying
and removing the unessential component and composes a new relation triple by
fusing with a semantically or visually similar object from a visual components
dictionary, whilst ensuring the realisticity of the newly composed triple.
Notably, our strategy is generic and can be combined with existing SGG models
to significantly improve their performance. We performed a comprehensive
evaluation on the benchmark dataset Visual Genome. For three recent SGG models,
adding our strategy improves their performance by close to 50\%, and all of
them substantially exceed the current state-of-the-art.</span>

likelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation
and synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D
order by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the
left. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural
for images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost
complete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring
more global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a
remedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the
autoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a
multistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an
image, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage,
the resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context
from previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly
improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also
providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through
efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can
take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image
editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve
free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local,
text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning is gaining popularity in a broad range of areas working with
geographic data, such as ecology or atmospheric sciences. Here, data often
exhibit spatial effects, which can be difficult to learn for neural networks.
In this study, we propose SXL, a method for embedding information on the
autoregressive nature of spatial data directly into the learning process using
auxiliary tasks. We utilize the local Moran&#x27;s I, a popular measure of local
spatial autocorrelation, to &quot;nudge&quot; the model to learn the direction and
magnitude of local spatial effects, complementing the learning of the primary
task. We further introduce a novel expansion of Moran&#x27;s I to multiple
resolutions, thus capturing spatial interactions over longer and shorter
distances simultaneously. The novel multi-resolution Moran&#x27;s I can be
constructed easily and as a multi-dimensional tensor offers seamless
integration into existing machine learning frameworks. Throughout a range of
experiments using real-world data, we highlight how our method consistently
improves the training of neural networks in unsupervised and supervised
learning tasks. In generative spatial modeling experiments, we propose a novel
loss for auxiliary task GANs utilizing task uncertainty weights. Our proposed
method outperforms domain-specific spatial interpolation benchmarks,
highlighting its potential for downstream applications. This study bridges
expertise from geographic information science and machine learning, showing how
this integration of disciplines can help to address domain-specific challenges.

multi-camera system from affine correspondences (ACs). A new constraint is
derived interpreting the relationship of ACs and the generalized camera model.
Using the constraint, we demonstrate efficient solvers for two types of motions
assumed. Considering that the cameras undergo planar motion, we propose a
minimal solution using a single AC and a solver with two ACs to overcome the
degenerate case. Also, we propose a minimal solution using two ACs with known
vertical direction, e.g., from an IMU. Since the proposed methods require
significantly fewer correspondences than state-of-the-art algorithms, they can
be efficiently used within RANSAC for outlier removal and initial motion
estimation. The solvers are tested both on synthetic data and on real-world
scenes from the KITTI odometry benchmark. It is shown that the accuracy of the
estimated poses is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques.</span>

importance for quality assurance of video services. The inaccessibility of
reference videos with pristine quality and the complexity of authentic
distortions pose great challenges for this kind of blind video quality
assessment (BVQA) task. Although model-based transfer learning is an effective
and efficient paradigm for the BVQA task, it remains to be a challenge to
explore what and how to bridge the domain shifts for better video
representation. In this work, we propose to transfer knowledge from image
quality assessment (IQA) databases with authentic distortions and large-scale
action recognition with rich motion patterns. We rely on both groups of data to
learn the feature extractor. We train the proposed model on the target VQA
databases using a mixed list-wise ranking loss function. Extensive experiments
on six databases demonstrate that our method performs very competitively under
both individual database and mixed database training settings. We also verify
the rationality of each component of the proposed method and explore a simple
manner for further improvement.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we study the problem of Novel Class Discovery (NCD). NCD aims
at inferring novel object categories in an unlabeled set by leveraging from
prior knowledge of a labeled set containing different, but related classes.
Existing approaches tackle this problem by considering multiple objective
functions, usually involving specialized loss terms for the labeled and the
unlabeled samples respectively, and often requiring auxiliary regularization
terms. In this paper, we depart from this traditional scheme and introduce a
UNified Objective function (UNO) for discovering novel classes, with the
explicit purpose of favoring synergy between supervised and unsupervised
learning. Using a multi-view self-labeling strategy, we generate pseudo-labels
that can be treated homogeneously with ground truth labels. This leads to a
single classification objective operating on both known and unknown classes.
Despite its simplicity, UNO outperforms the state of the art by a significant
margin on several benchmarks (~+10% on CIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet). The

in count distribution and exhibit discontinuities across the count range. As a
result, the de facto statistical measures (MSE, MAE) exhibit large variance and
tend to be unreliable indicators of performance across the count range. To
address these concerns in a holistic manner, we revise processes at various
stages of the standard crowd counting pipeline. To enable principled and
balanced minibatch sampling, we propose a novel smoothed Bayesian sample
stratification approach. We propose a novel cost function which can be readily
incorporated into existing crowd counting deep networks to encourage
strata-aware optimization. We analyze the performance of representative crowd
counting approaches across standard datasets at per strata level and in
aggregate. We analyze the performance of crowd counting approaches across
standard datasets and demonstrate that our proposed modifications noticeably

                                        <span>Deep learning-based blind super-resolution (SR) methods have recently
achieved unprecedented performance in upscaling frames with unknown
degradation. These models are able to accurately estimate the unknown
downscaling kernel from a given low-resolution (LR) image in order to leverage
the kernel during restoration. Although these approaches have largely been
successful, they are predominantly image-based and therefore do not exploit the
temporal properties of the kernels across multiple video frames. In this paper,
we investigated the temporal properties of the kernels and highlighted its
importance in the task of blind video super-resolution. Specifically, we
measured the kernel temporal consistency of real-world videos and illustrated
how the estimated kernels might change per frame in videos of varying
dynamicity of the scene and its objects. With this new insight, we revisited
previous popular video SR approaches, and showed that previous assumptions of
using a fixed kernel throughout the restoration process can lead to visual
artifacts when upscaling real-world videos. In order to counteract this, we
tailored existing single-image and video SR techniques to leverage kernel
consistency during both kernel estimation and video upscaling processes.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world videos show substantial
restoration gains quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving the new
state-of-the-art in blind video SR and underlining the potential of exploiting
kernel temporal consistency.</span>

recognition tasks. In this paper, we present a counterfactual attention
learning method to learn more effective attention based on causal inference.
Unlike most existing methods that learn visual attention based on conventional
likelihood, we propose to learn the attention with counterfactual causality,
which provides a tool to measure the attention quality and a powerful
supervisory signal to guide the learning process. Specifically, we analyze the
effect of the learned visual attention on network prediction through
counterfactual intervention and maximize the effect to encourage the network to
learn more useful attention for fine-grained image recognition. Empirically, we
evaluate our method on a wide range of fine-grained recognition tasks where
attention plays a crucial role, including fine-grained image categorization,
person re-identification, and vehicle re-identification. The consistent
improvement on all benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

person image representation and re-identification task via feature erasing.
However, BDB drops the features \textbf{randomly} which may lead to sub-optimal
results. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Thresholding attention guided
Adaptive DropBlock network (STADB) for person re-ID which can
\textbf{adaptively} erase the most discriminative regions. Specifically, STADB
first obtains an attention map by channel-wise pooling and returns a drop mask
by thresholding the attention map. Then, the input features and
self-thresholding attention guided drop mask are multiplied to generate the
dropped feature maps. In addition, STADB utilizes the spatial and channel
attention to learn a better feature map and iteratively trains the feature
dropping module for person re-ID. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed STADB outperforms many other related methods for
person re-ID. The source code of this paper is released at:

                                        <span>Despite superior performance on many computer vision tasks, deep convolution
neural networks are well known to be compressed on devices that have resource
constraints. Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human
efforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints
are changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when
the model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing
methods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper
we propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model
compression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck
theory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each
other. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer
importance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC
indicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into
a linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is
easily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also
provide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC
simultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers.
Without any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs
comparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with
ResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet. Codes are avaliable at

Primitive-based representations approximate a 3D shape mainly by a set of
simple implicit primitives, but the low geometrical complexity of the
primitives limits the shape resolution. Moreover, setting a sufficient number
of primitives for an arbitrary shape is challenging. To overcome these issues,
we propose a constrained implicit algebraic surface as the primitive with few
learnable coefficients and higher geometrical complexities and a deep neural
network to produce these primitives. Our experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method in terms of representation power compared to the
state-of-the-art methods in single RGB image 3D shape reconstruction.
Furthermore, we show that our method can semantically learn segments of 3D
shapes in an unsupervised manner. The code is publicly available from

generation where the user can control the motion of the synthesized video
through mouse clicks specifying simple object trajectories of the key objects
in the scene. Our model receives as input an initial frame, its corresponding
segmentation map and the sparse motion vectors encoding the input provided by
the user. It outputs a plausible video sequence starting from the given frame
and with a motion that is consistent with user input. Notably, our proposed
deep architecture incorporates a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) modelling the
movements of all the objects in the scene in a holistic manner and effectively
combining the sparse user motion information and image features. Experimental

                                        <span>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved impressive
performance on outdoor datasets. Its performance however degrades notably in
indoor environments because of the lack of textures. Without rich textures, the
photometric consistency is too weak to train a good depth network. Inspired by
the early works on indoor modeling, we leverage the structural regularities
exhibited in indoor scenes, to train a better depth network. Specifically, we
adopt two extra supervisory signals for self-supervised training: 1) the
Manhattan normal constraint and 2) the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan
normal constraint enforces the major surfaces (the floor, ceiling, and walls)
to be aligned with dominant directions. The co-planar constraint states that
the 3D points be well fitted by a plane if they are located within the same
planar region. To generate the supervisory signals, we adopt two components to
classify the major surface normal into dominant directions and detect the
planar regions on the fly during training. As the predicted depth becomes more
accurate after more training epochs, the supervisory signals also improve and
in turn feedback to obtain a better depth model. Through extensive experiments
on indoor benchmark datasets, the results show that our network outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at

but it usually requires a large numberof images labeled with fine-grained
segmentation masks, andthe annotation of these masks can be very expensive
andtime-consuming. Therefore, recent methods try to use un-supervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods to borrow in-formation from labeled data from other
datasets (source do-mains) to a new dataset (target domain). However, due tothe
absence of labels in the target domain, the performance ofUDA methods is much
worse than that of the fully supervisedmethod. In this paper, we propose a
weakly supervised do-main adaptation setting, in which we can partially label
newdatasets with bounding boxes, which are easier and cheaperto obtain than
segmentation masks. Accordingly, we proposea new weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method calledBox-Adapt, which fully explores the fine-grained
segmenta-tion mask in the source domain and the weak bounding boxin the target
domain. Our Box-Adapt is a two-stage methodthat first performs joint training
on the source and target do-mains, and then conducts self-training with the
pseudo-labelsof the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
ourmethod in the liver segmentation task. Weakly supervised do-main adaptation</span>

                                        <span>Lane detection plays a key role in autonomous driving. While car cameras
always take streaming videos on the way, current lane detection works mainly
focus on individual images (frames) by ignoring dynamics along the video. In
this work, we collect a new video instance lane detection (VIL-100) dataset,
which contains 100 videos with in total 10,000 frames, acquired from different
real traffic scenarios. All the frames in each video are manually annotated to
a high-quality instance-level lane annotation, and a set of frame-level and
video-level metrics are included for quantitative performance evaluation.
Moreover, we propose a new baseline model, named multi-level memory aggregation
network (MMA-Net), for video instance lane detection. In our approach, the
representation of current frame is enhanced by attentively aggregating both
local and global memory features from other frames. Experiments on the new
collected dataset show that the proposed MMA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
lane detection methods and video object segmentation methods. We release our
dataset and code at https://github.com/yujun0-0/MMA-Net.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, for the first time, we address the problem of universal
cross-domain retrieval, where the test data can belong to classes or domains
which are unseen during training. Due to dynamically increasing number of
categories and practical constraint of training on every possible domain, which
requires large amounts of data, generalizing to both unseen classes and domains
is important. Towards that goal, we propose SnMpNet (Semantic Neighbourhood and
Mixture Prediction Network), which incorporates two novel losses to account for
the unseen classes and domains encountered during testing. Specifically, we
introduce a novel Semantic Neighborhood loss to bridge the knowledge gap
between seen and unseen classes and ensure that the latent space embedding of
the unseen classes is semantically meaningful with respect to its neighboring
classes. We also introduce a mix-up based supervision at image-level as well as
semantic-level of the data for training with the Mixture Prediction loss, which
helps in efficient retrieval when the query belongs to an unseen domain. These
losses are incorporated on the SE-ResNet50 backbone to obtain SnMpNet.
Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, Sketchy Extended and
DomainNet, and thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art justify the
effectiveness of the proposed model.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, the generalization behavior of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
is gradually transparent through explanation techniques with the frequency
components decomposition. However, the importance of the phase spectrum of the
image for a robust vision system is still ignored. In this paper, we notice
that the CNN tends to converge at the local optimum which is closely related to
the high-frequency components of the training images, while the amplitude
spectrum is easily disturbed such as noises or common corruptions. In contrast,
more empirical studies found that humans rely on more phase components to
achieve robust recognition. This observation leads to more explanations of the
CNN&#x27;s generalization behaviors in both robustness to common perturbations and
out-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data
augmentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and
the amplitude spectrum of the distracter image. That is, the generated samples
force the CNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase
components and keep robust to the variation of the amplitude. Experiments on
several image datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performances on multiple generalizations and calibration
tasks, including adaptability for common corruptions and surface variations,
out-of-distribution detection, and adversarial attack.</span>

                                        <span>The world is going through a challenging phase due to the disastrous effect
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and the economy. The
rate of spreading, post-COVID-19 symptoms, and the occurrence of new strands of
COVID-19 have put the healthcare systems in disruption across the globe. Due to
this, the task of accurately screening COVID-19 cases has become of utmost
priority. Since the virus infects the respiratory system, Chest X-Ray is an
imaging modality that is adopted extensively for the initial screening. We have
performed a comprehensive study that uses CXR images to identify COVID-19 cases
and realized the necessity of having a more generalizable model. We utilize
MobileNetV2 architecture as the feature extractor and integrate it into Capsule
Networks to construct a fully automated and lightweight model termed as
MobileCaps. MobileCaps is trained and evaluated on the publicly available
dataset with the model ensembling and Bayesian optimization strategies to
efficiently classify CXR images of patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19
pneumonia and healthy cases. The proposed model is further evaluated on two
additional RT-PCR confirmed datasets to demonstrate the generalizability. We
also introduce MobileCaps-S and leverage it for performing severity assessment
of CXR images of COVID-19 based on the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema
(RALE) scoring technique. Our classification model achieved an overall recall
of 91.60, 94.60, 92.20, and a precision of 98.50, 88.21, 92.62 for COVID-19,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy cases, respectively. Further, the severity
assessment model attained an R$^2$ coefficient of 70.51. Owing to the fact that
the proposed models have fewer trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art
models reported in the literature, we believe our models will go a long way in
aiding healthcare systems in the battle against the pandemic.</span>

vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recent research has shown that checking the
intrinsic consistencies in the input data is a promising way to detect
adversarial attacks (e.g., by checking the object co-occurrence relationships
in complex scenes). However, existing approaches are tied to specific models
and do not offer generalizability. Motivated by the observation that language
descriptions of natural scene images have already captured the object
co-occurrence relationships that can be learned by a language model, we develop
a novel approach to perform context consistency checks using such language
models. The distinguishing aspect of our approach is that it is independent of
the deployed object detector and yet offers very high accuracy in terms of
detecting adversarial examples in practical scenes with multiple objects.</span>

representations, which aims at efficient adaptation from pre-training domain to
downstream tasks. Existing approaches merely leverage contrastive loss to learn
instance-level discrimination. However, lack of category information will lead
to hard-positive problem that constrains the generalization ability of this
kind of methods. We find that the multi-task process of meta learning can
provide a solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a
Meta-Contrastive Network (MCN), which combines the contrastive learning and
meta learning, to enhance the learning ability of existing self-supervised
approaches. Our method contains two training stages based on model-agnostic
meta learning (MAML), each of which consists of a contrastive branch and a meta
branch. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For
two downstream tasks, i.e., video action recognition and video retrieval, MCN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. To be
more specific, with R(2+1)D backbone, MCN achieves Top-1 accuracies of 84.8%

                                        <span>Recent progress in stochastic motion prediction, i.e., predicting multiple
possible future human motions given a single past pose sequence, has led to
producing truly diverse future motions and even providing control over the
motion of some body parts. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art
method requires learning several mappings for diversity and a dedicated model
for controllable motion prediction. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep
generative network for both diverse and controllable motion prediction. To this
end, we leverage the intuition that realistic human motions consist of smooth
sequences of valid poses, and that, given limited data, learning a pose prior
is much more tractable than a motion one. We therefore design a generator that
predicts the motion of different body parts sequentially, and introduce a
normalizing flow based pose prior, together with a joint angle loss, to achieve
motion realism.Our experiments on two standard benchmark datasets, Human3.6M
and HumanEva-I, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of both sample diversity and accuracy. The code is available

                                        <span>Panoptic segmentation as an integrated task of both static environmental
understanding and dynamic object identification, has recently begun to receive
broad research interest. In this paper, we propose a new computationally
efficient LiDAR based panoptic segmentation framework, called GP-S3Net.
GP-S3Net is a proposal-free approach in which no object proposals are needed to
identify the objects in contrast to conventional two-stage panoptic systems,
where a detection network is incorporated for capturing instance information.
Our new design consists of a novel instance-level network to process the
semantic results by constructing a graph convolutional network to identify
objects (foreground), which later on are fused with the background classes.
Through the fine-grained clusters of the foreground objects from the semantic
segmentation backbone, over-segmentation priors are generated and subsequently
processed by 3D sparse convolution to embed each cluster. Each cluster is
treated as a node in the graph and its corresponding embedding is used as its
node feature. Then a GCNN predicts whether edges exist between each cluster
pair. We utilize the instance label to generate ground truth edge labels for
each constructed graph in order to supervise the learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GP-S3Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art
approaches, by a significant margin across available datasets such as, nuScenes
and SemanticPOSS, ranking first on the competitive public SemanticKITTI
leaderboard upon publication.</span>

                                        <span>Although LEGO sets have entertained generations of children and adults, the
challenge of designing customized builds matching the complexity of real-world
or imagined scenes remains too great for the average enthusiast. In order to
make this feat possible, we implement a system that generates a LEGO brick
model from 2D images. We design a novel solution to this problem that uses an
octree-structured autoencoder trained on 3D voxelized models to obtain a
feasible latent representation for model reconstruction, and a separate network
trained to predict this latent representation from 2D images. LEGO models are
obtained by algorithmic conversion of the 3D voxelized model to bricks. We
demonstrate first-of-its-kind conversion of photographs to 3D LEGO models. An
octree architecture enables the flexibility to produce multiple resolutions to
best fit a user&#x27;s creative vision or design needs. In order to demonstrate the
broad applicability of our system, we generate step-by-step building
instructions and animations for LEGO models of objects and human faces.
Finally, we test these automatically generated LEGO sets by constructing
physical builds using real LEGO bricks.</span>

                                        <span>Large-scale visual place recognition (VPR) is inherently challenging because
not all visual cues in the image are beneficial to the task. In order to
highlight the task-relevant visual cues in the feature embedding, the existing
attention mechanisms are either based on artificial rules or trained in a
thorough data-driven manner. To fill the gap between the two types, we propose
a novel Semantic Reinforced Attention Learning Network (SRALNet), in which the
inferred attention can benefit from both semantic priors and data-driven
fine-tuning. The contribution lies in two-folds. (1) To suppress misleading
local features, an interpretable local weighting scheme is proposed based on
hierarchical feature distribution. (2) By exploiting the interpretability of
the local weighting scheme, a semantic constrained initialization is proposed
so that the local attention can be reinforced by semantic priors. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on
city-scale VPR benchmark datasets.</span>

in the design of computer vision algorithms with a clear compromise between
accuracy and computational requirements. In this paper we present new binary
image descriptors that emerge from the application of triplet ranking loss,
hard negative mining and anchor swapping to traditional features based on pixel
differences and image gradients. These descriptors, BAD (Box Average
Difference) and HashSIFT, establish new operating points in the

we evaluate the accuracy, execution time and energy consumption of the proposed

the literature while HashSIFT approaches in accuracy that of the top deep
learning-based descriptors, being computationally more efficient. We have made

large-scale unlabeled data to mitigate the dependency on labeled data in order
to learn better models for visual recognition and classification tasks.
However, recent SSL methods rely on unlabeled image data at a scale of billions
to work well. This becomes infeasible for tasks with relatively fewer unlabeled
data in terms of runtime, memory and data acquisition. To address this issue,
we propose noisy semi-supervised transfer learning, an efficient SSL approach
that integrates transfer learning and self-training with noisy student into a
single framework, which is tailored for tasks that can leverage unlabeled image
data on a scale of thousands. We evaluate our method on both binary and
multi-class classification tasks, where the objective is to identify whether an
image displays people practicing sports or the type of sport, as well as to
identify the pose from a pool of popular yoga poses. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies demonstrate that by leveraging unlabeled data, our proposed
framework significantly improves visual classification, especially in
multi-class classification settings compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, incorporating transfer learning not only improves classification
performance, but also requires 6x less compute time and 5x less memory. We also
show that our method boosts robustness of visual classification models, even
without specifically optimizing for adversarial robustness.</span>

license plates in the wild. We trained our models on the image dataset and

                                        <span>This paper considers the problem of generating an HDR image of a scene from
its LDR images. Recent studies employ deep learning and solve the problem in an
end-to-end fashion, leading to significant performance improvements. However,
it is still hard to generate a good quality image from LDR images of a dynamic
scene captured by a hand-held camera, e.g., occlusion due to the large motion
of foreground objects, causing ghosting artifacts. The key to success relies on
how well we can fuse the input images in their feature space, where we wish to
remove the factors leading to low-quality image generation while performing the
fundamental computations for HDR image generation, e.g., selecting the
best-exposed image/region. We propose a novel method that can better fuse the
features based on two ideas. One is multi-step feature fusion; our network
gradually fuses the features in a stack of blocks having the same structure.
The other is the design of the component block that effectively performs two
operations essential to the problem, i.e., comparing and selecting appropriate
images/regions. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark tests.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic segmentation is an important task that helps autonomous vehicles
understand their surroundings and navigate safely. During deployment, even the
most mature segmentation models are vulnerable to various external factors that
can degrade the segmentation performance with potentially catastrophic
consequences for the vehicle and its surroundings. To address this issue, we
propose a failure detection framework to identify pixel-level
misclassification. We do so by exploiting internal features of the segmentation
model and training it simultaneously with a failure detection network. During
deployment, the failure detector can flag areas in the image where the
segmentation model have failed to segment correctly. We evaluate the proposed
approach against state-of-the-art methods and achieve 12.30%, 9.46%, and 9.65%
performance improvement in the AUPR-Error metric for Cityscapes, BDD100K, and
Mapillary semantic segmentation datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Deep networks often make confident, yet incorrect, predictions when tested
with outlier data that is far removed from their training distributions.
Likelihoods computed by deep generative models are a candidate metric for
outlier detection with unlabeled data. Yet, previous studies have shown that
such likelihoods are unreliable and can be easily biased by simple
transformations to input data. Here, we examine outlier detection with
variational autoencoders (VAEs), among the simplest class of deep generative
models. First, we show that a theoretically-grounded correction readily
ameliorates a key bias with VAE likelihood estimates. The bias correction is
model-free, sample-specific, and accurately computed with the Bernoulli and
continuous Bernoulli visible distributions. Second, we show that a well-known
preprocessing technique, contrast normalization, extends the effectiveness of
bias correction to natural image datasets. Third, we show that the variance of
the likelihoods computed over an ensemble of VAEs also enables robust outlier
detection. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of our remedies with nine
(grayscale and natural) image datasets, and demonstrate significant advantages,
in terms of both speed and accuracy, over four other state-of-the-art methods.
Our lightweight remedies are biologically inspired and may serve to achieve
efficient outlier detection with many types of deep generative models.</span>

                                        <span>Existing self-supervised learning methods learn representation by means of
pretext tasks which are either (1) discriminating that explicitly specify which
features should be separated or (2) aligning that precisely indicate which
features should be closed together, but ignore the fact how to jointly and
principally define which features to be repelled and which ones to be
attracted. In this work, we combine the positive aspects of the discriminating
and aligning methods, and design a hybrid method that addresses the above
issue. Our method explicitly specifies the repulsion and attraction mechanism
respectively by discriminative predictive task and concurrently maximizing
mutual information between paired views sharing redundant information. We
qualitatively and quantitatively show that our proposed model learns better
features that are more effective for the diverse downstream tasks ranging from
classification to semantic segmentation. Our experiments on nine established

                                        <span>We present a novel framework for mesh reconstruction from unstructured point
clouds by taking advantage of the learned visibility of the 3D points in the
virtual views and traditional graph-cut based mesh generation. Specifically, we
first propose a three-step network that explicitly employs depth completion for
visibility prediction. Then the visibility information of multiple views is
aggregated to generate a 3D mesh model by solving an optimization problem
considering visibility in which a novel adaptive visibility weighting in
surface determination is also introduced to suppress line of sight with a large
incident angle. Compared to other learning-based approaches, our pipeline only
exercises the learning on a 2D binary classification task, \ie, points visible
or not in a view, which is much more generalizable and practically more
efficient and capable to deal with a large number of points. Experiments
demonstrate that our method with favorable transferability and robustness, and
achieve competing performances \wrt state-of-the-art learning-based approaches
on small complex objects and outperforms on large indoor and outdoor scenes.

                                        <span>Radiomics uses quantitative medical imaging features to predict clinical
outcomes. While many radiomics methods have been described in the literature,
these are generally designed for a single application. The aim of this study is
to generalize radiomics across applications by proposing a framework to
automatically construct and optimize the radiomics workflow per application. To
this end, we formulate radiomics as a modular workflow, consisting of several
components: image and segmentation preprocessing, feature extraction, feature
and sample preprocessing, and machine learning. For each component, a
collection of common algorithms is included. To optimize the workflow per
application, we employ automated machine learning using a random search and
ensembling. We evaluate our method in twelve different clinical applications,
resulting in the following area under the curves: 1) liposarcoma (0.83); 2)
desmoid-type fibromatosis (0.82); 3) primary liver tumors (0.81); 4)
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (0.77); 5) colorectal liver metastases (0.68);
6) melanoma metastases (0.51); 7) hepatocellular carcinoma (0.75); 8)
mesenteric fibrosis (0.81); 9) prostate cancer (0.72); 10) glioma (0.70); 11)
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (0.87); and 12) head and neck cancer (0.84). Concluding,
our method fully automatically constructs and optimizes the radiomics workflow,
thereby streamlining the search for radiomics biomarkers in new applications.
To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we publicly release six
datasets, the software implementation of our framework (open-source), and the
code to reproduce this study.</span>

                                        <span>Controllable scene synthesis consists of generating 3D information that
satisfy underlying specifications. Thereby, these specifications should be
abstract, i.e. allowing easy user interaction, whilst providing enough
interface for detailed control. Scene graphs are representations of a scene,
composed of objects (nodes) and inter-object relationships (edges), proven to
be particularly suited for this task, as they allow for semantic control on the
generated content. Previous works tackling this task often rely on synthetic
data, and retrieve object meshes, which naturally limits the generation
capabilities. To circumvent this issue, we instead propose the first work that
directly generates shapes from a scene graph in an end-to-end manner. In
addition, we show that the same model supports scene modification, using the
respective scene graph as interface. Leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) we train a variational Auto-Encoder on top of the object and edge
categories, as well as 3D shapes and scene layouts, allowing latter sampling of
new scenes and shapes.</span>

                                        <span>Colorization has attracted increasing interest in recent years. Classic
reference-based methods usually rely on external color images for plausible
results. A large image database or online search engine is inevitably required
for retrieving such exemplars. Recent deep-learning-based methods could
automatically colorize images at a low cost. However, unsatisfactory artifacts
and incoherent colors are always accompanied. In this work, we aim at
recovering vivid colors by leveraging the rich and diverse color priors
encapsulated in a pretrained Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
Specifically, we first &quot;retrieve&quot; matched features (similar to exemplars) via a
GAN encoder and then incorporate these features into the colorization process
with feature modulations. Thanks to the powerful generative color prior and
delicate designs, our method could produce vivid colors with a single forward
pass. Moreover, it is highly convenient to obtain diverse results by modifying
GAN latent codes. Our method also inherits the merit of interpretable controls
of GANs and could attain controllable and smooth transitions by walking through
GAN latent space. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that our
method achieves superior performance than previous works.</span>

state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several publicly available datasets.
However, most existing methods fail to meet practical requirements either for
visual perception or for computation efficiency, especially for high-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time image enhancer via
learnable spatial-aware 3-dimentional lookup tables(3D LUTs), which well
considers global scenario and local spatial information. Specifically, we
introduce a light weight two-head weight predictor that has two outputs. One is
a 1D weight vector used for image-level scenario adaptation, the other is a 3D
weight map aimed for pixel-wise category fusion. We learn the spatial-aware 3D
LUTs and fuse them according to the aforementioned weights in an end-to-end
manner. The fused LUT is then used to transform the source image into the
target tone in an efficient way. Extensive results show that our model
outperforms SOTA image enhancement methods on public datasets both subjectively
and objectively, and that our model only takes about 4ms to process a 4K
resolution image on one NVIDIA V100 GPU.</span>

                                        <span>We present a general learning-based solution for restoring images suffering
from spatially-varying degradations. Prior approaches are typically
degradation-specific and employ the same processing across different images and
different pixels within. However, we hypothesize that such spatially rigid
processing is suboptimal for simultaneously restoring the degraded pixels as
well as reconstructing the clean regions of the image. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SPAIR, a network design that harnesses
distortion-localization information and dynamically adjusts computation to
difficult regions in the image. SPAIR comprises of two components, (1) a
localization network that identifies degraded pixels, and (2) a restoration
network that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and
feature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels. Our key
idea is to exploit the non-uniformity of heavy degradations in spatial-domain
and suitably embed this knowledge within distortion-guided modules performing
sparse normalization, feature extraction and attention. Our architecture is
agnostic to physical formation model and generalizes across several types of
spatially-varying degradations. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPAIR
individually on four restoration tasks-removal of rain-streaks, raindrops,
shadows and motion blur. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons
with prior art on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
degradation-agnostic network design offers significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art degradation-specific architectures. Code available at

                                        <span>Superpixel segmentation has recently seen important progress benefiting from
the advances in differentiable deep learning. However, the very high-resolution
superpixel segmentation still remains challenging due to the expensive memory
and computation cost, making the current advanced superpixel networks fail to
process. In this paper, we devise Patch Calibration Networks (PCNet), aiming to
efficiently and accurately implement high-resolution superpixel segmentation.
PCNet follows the principle of producing high-resolution output from
low-resolution input for saving GPU memory and relieving computation cost. To
recall the fine details destroyed by the down-sampling operation, we propose a
novel Decoupled Patch Calibration (DPC) branch for collaboratively augment the
main superpixel generation branch. In particular, DPC takes a local patch from
the high-resolution images and dynamically generates a binary mask to impose
the network to focus on region boundaries. By sharing the parameters of DPC and
main branches, the fine-detailed knowledge learned from high-resolution patches
will be transferred to help calibrate the destroyed information. To the best of
our knowledge, we make the first attempt to consider the deep-learning-based
superpixel generation for high-resolution cases. To facilitate this research,
we build evaluation benchmarks from two public datasets and one new constructed
one, covering a wide range of diversities from fine-grained human parts to
cityscapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PCNet can not only
perform favorably against the state-of-the-arts in the quantitative results but
also improve the resolution upper bound from 3K to 5K on 1080Ti GPUs.</span>

                                        <span>Single-image high dynamic range (SI-HDR) reconstruction has recently emerged
as a problem well-suited for deep learning methods. Each successive technique
demonstrates an improvement over existing methods by reporting higher image
quality scores. This paper, however, highlights that such improvements in
objective metrics do not necessarily translate to visually superior images. The
first problem is the use of disparate evaluation conditions in terms of data
and metric parameters, calling for a standardized protocol to make it possible
to compare between papers. The second problem, which forms the main focus of
this paper, is the inherent difficulty in evaluating SI-HDR reconstructions
since certain aspects of the reconstruction problem dominate objective
differences, thereby introducing a bias. Here, we reproduce a typical
evaluation using existing as well as simulated SI-HDR methods to demonstrate
how different aspects of the problem affect objective quality metrics.
Surprisingly, we found that methods that do not even reconstruct HDR
information can compete with state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We show
how such results are not representative of the perceived quality and that
SI-HDR reconstruction needs better evaluation protocols.</span>

                                        <span>Domain generalization aims to enhance the model robustness against domain
shift without accessing the target domain. Since the available source domains
for training are limited, recent approaches focus on generating samples of
novel domains. Nevertheless, they either struggle with the optimization problem
when synthesizing abundant domains or cause the distortion of class semantics.
To these ends, we propose a novel domain generalization framework where feature
statistics are utilized for stylizing original features to ones with novel
domain properties. To preserve class information during stylization, we first
decompose features into high and low frequency components. Afterward, we
stylize the low frequency components with the novel domain styles sampled from
the manipulated statistics, while preserving the shape cues in high frequency
ones. As the final step, we re-merge both components to synthesize novel domain
features. To enhance domain robustness, we utilize the stylized features to
maintain the model consistency in terms of features as well as outputs. We
achieve the feature consistency with the proposed domain-aware supervised
contrastive loss, which ensures domain invariance while increasing class
discriminability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed feature stylization and the domain-aware contrastive loss. Through
quantitative comparisons, we verify the lead of our method upon existing
state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks, PACS and Office-Home.</span>

                                        <span>Human Pose Estimation (HPE) aims at retrieving the 3D position of human
joints from images or videos. We show that current 3D HPE methods suffer a lack
of viewpoint equivariance, namely they tend to fail or perform poorly when
dealing with viewpoints unseen at training time. Deep learning methods often
rely on either scale-invariant, translation-invariant, or rotation-invariant
operations, such as max-pooling. However, the adoption of such procedures does
not necessarily improve viewpoint generalization, rather leading to more
data-dependent methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel capsule
autoencoder network with fast Variational Bayes capsule routing, named DECA. By
modeling each joint as a capsule entity, combined with the routing algorithm,
our approach can preserve the joints&#x27; hierarchical and geometrical structure in
the feature space, independently from the viewpoint. By achieving viewpoint
equivariance, we drastically reduce the network data dependency at training
time, resulting in an improved ability to generalize for unseen viewpoints. In
the experimental validation, we outperform other methods on depth images from
both seen and unseen viewpoints, both top-view, and front-view. In the RGB
domain, the same network gives state-of-the-art results on the challenging
viewpoint transfer task, also establishing a new framework for top-view HPE.

                                        <span>The performance of a computer vision model depends on the size and quality of
its training data. Recent studies have unveiled previously-unknown composition
biases in common image datasets which then lead to skewed model outputs, and
have proposed methods to mitigate these biases. However, most existing works
assume that human-generated annotations can be considered gold-standard and
unbiased. In this paper, we reveal that this assumption can be problematic, and
that special care should be taken to prevent models from learning such
annotation biases. We focus on facial expression recognition and compare the
label biases between lab-controlled and in-the-wild datasets. We demonstrate
that many expression datasets contain significant annotation biases between
genders, especially when it comes to the happy and angry expressions, and that
traditional methods cannot fully mitigate such biases in trained models. To
remove expression annotation bias, we propose an AU-Calibrated Facial
Expression Recognition (AUC-FER) framework that utilizes facial action units
(AUs) and incorporates the triplet loss into the objective function.
Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is more effective in
removing expression annotation bias than existing techniques.</span>

                                        <span>A signed distance function (SDF) as the 3D shape description is one of the
most effective approaches to represent 3D geometry for rendering and
reconstruction. Our work is inspired by the state-of-the-art method DeepSDF
that learns and analyzes the 3D shape as the iso-surface of its shell and this
method has shown promising results especially in the 3D shape reconstruction
and compression domain. In this paper, we consider the degeneration problem of
reconstruction coming from the capacity decrease of the DeepSDF model, which
approximates the SDF with a neural network and a single latent code. We propose
Local Geometry Code Learning (LGCL), a model that improves the original DeepSDF
results by learning from a local shape geometry of the full 3D shape. We add an
extra graph neural network to split the single transmittable latent code into a
set of local latent codes distributed on the 3D shape. Mentioned latent codes
are used to approximate the SDF in their local regions, which will alleviate
the complexity of the approximation compared to the original DeepSDF.
Furthermore, we introduce a new geometric loss function to facilitate the
training of these local latent codes. Note that other local shape adjusting
methods use the 3D voxel representation, which in turn is a problem highly
difficult to solve or even is insolvable. In contrast, our architecture is
based on graph processing implicitly and performs the learning regression
process directly in the latent code space, thus make the proposed architecture
more flexible and also simple for realization. Our experiments on 3D shape
reconstruction demonstrate that our LGCL method can keep more details with a
significantly smaller size of the SDF decoder and outperforms considerably the
original DeepSDF method under the most important quantitative metrics.</span>

the 3D rotation and translation) in a cluttered environment from a single RGB
image is a challenging problem. While end-to-end methods have recently
demonstrated promising results at high efficiency, they are still inferior when
compared with elaborate P$n$P/RANSAC-based approaches in terms of pose
accuracy. In this work, we address this shortcoming by means of a novel
reasoning about self-occlusion, in order to establish a two-layer
representation for 3D objects which considerably enhances the accuracy of
end-to-end 6D pose estimation. Our framework, named SO-Pose, takes a single RGB
image as input and respectively generates 2D-3D correspondences as well as
self-occlusion information harnessing a shared encoder and two separate
decoders. Both outputs are then fused to directly regress the 6DoF pose
parameters. Incorporating cross-layer consistencies that align correspondences,
self-occlusion and 6D pose, we can further improve accuracy and robustness,
surpassing or rivaling all other state-of-the-art approaches on various
challenging datasets.</span>

annotations of 3D object pose, shape and part motion during human-object
interactions. Our dataset consists of several common articulated objects
captured from diverse real-world scenes and camera viewpoints. Each manipulated
object (e.g., microwave oven) is represented with a matching 3D parametric
model. This data allows us to evaluate the reconstruction quality of
articulated objects and establish a benchmark for this challenging task. In
particular, we leverage the estimated 3D human pose for more accurate inference
of the object spatial layout and dynamics. We evaluate this approach on our
dataset, demonstrating that human-object relations can significantly reduce the
ambiguity of articulated object reconstructions from challenging real-world
videos. Code and dataset are available at

from deep shape representations in recent years, garment reconstruction is
still not solved well due to open surfaces, diverse topologies and complex
geometric details. In this paper, we propose a novel learnable Anchored
Unsigned Distance Function (AnchorUDF) representation for 3D garment
reconstruction from a single image. AnchorUDF represents 3D shapes by
predicting unsigned distance fields (UDFs) to enable open garment surface
modeling at arbitrary resolution. To capture diverse garment topologies,
AnchorUDF not only computes pixel-aligned local image features of query points,
but also leverages a set of anchor points located around the surface to enrich
3D position features for query points, which provides stronger 3D space context
for the distance function. Furthermore, in order to obtain more accurate point
projection direction at inference, we explicitly align the spatial gradient
direction of AnchorUDF with the ground-truth direction to the surface during
training. Extensive experiments on two public 3D garment datasets, i.e., MGN
and Deep Fashion3D, demonstrate that AnchorUDF achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on single-view garment reconstruction.</span>

tubelets appearing within a video as a  triplet.
Where existing works treat object proposals or tubelets as single entities and
model their relations a posteriori, we propose to classify and detect
predicates for pairs of object tubelets a priori. We also propose Social
Fabric: an encoding that represents a pair of object tubelets as a composition
of interaction primitives. These primitives are learned over all relations,
resulting in a compact representation able to localize and classify relations
from the pool of co-occurring object tubelets across all timespans in a video.
The encoding enables our two-stage network. In the first stage, we train Social
Fabric to suggest proposals that are likely interacting. We use the Social
Fabric in the second stage to simultaneously fine-tune and predict predicate
labels for the tubelets. Experiments demonstrate the benefit of early video
relation modeling, our encoding and the two-stage architecture, leading to a
new state-of-the-art on two benchmarks. We also show how the encoding enables
query-by-primitive-example to search for spatio-temporal video relations. Code:

                                        <span>Recently, the retrieval models based on dense representations have been
gradually applied in the first stage of the document retrieval tasks, showing
better performance than traditional sparse vector space models. To obtain high
efficiency, the basic structure of these models is Bi-encoder in most cases.
However, this simple structure may cause serious information loss during the
encoding of documents since the queries are agnostic. To address this problem,
we design a method to mimic the queries on each of the documents by an
iterative clustering process and represent the documents by multiple pseudo
queries (i.e., the cluster centroids). To boost the retrieval process using
approximate nearest neighbor search library, we also optimize the matching
function with a two-step score calculation procedure. Experimental results on
several popular ranking and QA datasets show that our model can achieve
state-of-the-art results.</span>

perform poorly when applied to out-of-distribution data. As a starting point,
we provide zero-shot baselines for this new dataset based on a multi-lingual

                                        <span>In recent years, many recommender systems using network embedding (NE) such
as graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied in the sense of
improving recommendation accuracy. However, such attempts have focused mostly
on utilizing only the information of positive user-item interactions with high
ratings. Thus, there is a challenge on how to make use of low rating scores for
representing users&#x27; preferences since low ratings can be still informative in
designing NE-based recommender systems. In this study, we present SiReN, a new
sign-aware recommender system based on GNN models. Specifically, SiReN has
three key components: 1) constructing a signed bipartite graph for more
precisely representing users&#x27; preferences, which is split into two
edge-disjoint graphs with positive and negative edges each, 2) generating two
embeddings for the partitioned graphs with positive and negative edges via a

                                        <span>The goal of text ranking is to generate an ordered list of texts retrieved
from a corpus in response to a query. Although the most common formulation of
text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural
language processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text
ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT
is the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised
pretraining has been responsible for a paradigm shift in natural language
processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond. In this survey, we
provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for
practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply
transformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work
in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two
high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage
architectures and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly.
There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long
documents, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing in NLP, and
techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result
quality) and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although
transformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,
many aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well
understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open
research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of
pretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to
prognosticate where the field is heading.</span>

                                        <span>Question answering over knowledge graphs and other RDF data has been greatly
advanced, with a number of good systems providing crisp answers for natural
language questions or telegraphic queries. Some of these systems incorporate
textual sources as additional evidence for the answering process, but cannot
compute answers that are present in text alone. Conversely, systems from the IR
and NLP communities have addressed QA over text, but barely utilize semantic
data and knowledge. This paper presents the first QA system that can seamlessly
operate over RDF datasets and text corpora, or both together, in a unified
framework. Our method, called UNIQORN, builds a context graph on the fly, by
retrieving question-relevant triples from the RDF data and/or the text corpus,
where the latter case is handled by automatic information extraction. The
resulting graph is typically rich but highly noisy. UNIQORN copes with this
input by advanced graph algorithms for Group Steiner Trees, that identify the
best answer candidates in the context graph. Experimental results on several
benchmarks of complex questions with multiple entities and relations, show that
UNIQORN, an unsupervised method with only five parameters, produces results
comparable to the state-of-the-art on KGs, text corpora, and heterogeneous
sources. The graph-based methodology provides user-interpretable evidence for
the complete answering process.</span>

                                        <span>In counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) user interactions are used as a
source of supervision. Since user interactions come with bias, an important
focus of research in this field lies in developing methods to correct for the
bias of interactions. Inverse propensity scoring (IPS) is a popular method
suitable for correcting position bias. Affine correction (AC) is a
generalization of IPS that corrects for position bias and trust bias. IPS and
AC provably remove bias, conditioned on an accurate estimation of the bias
parameters. Estimating the bias parameters, in turn, requires an accurate
estimation of the relevance probabilities. This cyclic dependency introduces
practical limitations in terms of sensitivity, convergence and efficiency.

We propose a new correction method for position and trust bias in CLTR in
which, unlike the existing methods, the correction does not rely on relevance
estimation. Our proposed method, mixture-based correction (MBC), is based on
the assumption that the distribution of the CTRs over the items being ranked is
a mixture of two distributions: the distribution of CTRs for relevant items and
the distribution of CTRs for non-relevant items. We prove that our method is
unbiased. The validity of our proof is not conditioned on accurate bias
parameter estimation. Our experiments show that MBC, when used in different
bias settings and accompanied by different LTR algorithms, outperforms AC, the
state-of-the-art method for correcting position and trust bias, in some
settings, while performing on par in other settings. Furthermore, MBC is orders
of magnitude more efficient than AC in terms of the training time.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to
identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student&#x27;s performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.</span>

data with billions of facts, involving millions of entities and thousands of
predicates. For efficiency, QA systems first reduce the answer search space by
identifying a set of facts that is likely to contain all answers and relevant
cues. The most common technique is to apply named entity disambiguation (NED)
systems to the question, and retrieve KB facts for the disambiguated entities.
This work presents ECQA, an efficient method that prunes irrelevant parts of
the search space using KB-aware signals. ECQA is based on top-k query
processing over score-ordered lists of KB items that combine signals about
lexical matching, relevance to the question, coherence among candidate items,
and connectivity in the KB graph. Experiments with two recent QA benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of ECQA over state-of-the-art baselines with
respect to answer presence, size of the search space, and runtimes.</span>

latency) and computational resources (energy, hardware cost), making many of
these models impractical especially under resource constraints. The reliance on
a query encoder that only performs tokenization and on the pre-processing of
passage representations at indexing, has allowed the recently proposed TILDE
method to overcome the high query latency issue typical of BERT-based models.
This however is at the expense of a lower effectiveness compared to other
BERT-based re-rankers and dense retrievers. In addition, the original TILDE
method is characterised by indexes with a very high memory footprint, as it
expands each passage into the size of the BERT vocabulary. In this paper, we
propose TILDEv2, a new model that stems from the original TILDE but that
addresses its limitations. TILDEv2 relies on contextualized exact term matching
with expanded passages. This requires to only store in the index the score of
tokens that appear in the expanded passages (rather than all the vocabulary),
thus producing indexes that are 99% smaller than those of TILDE. This matching
mechanism also improves ranking effectiveness by 24%, without adding to the
query latency. This makes TILDEv2 the state-of-the-art passage re-ranking
method for CPU-only environments, capable of maintaining query latency below
100ms on commodity hardware.</span>

an individual can borrow a bike and returns it anywhere, within the service
area. To improve the rental service, available bikes should be distributed over
the entire service area: a customer leaving from any position is then more
likely to find a near bike and then to use the service. Moreover, spreading
bikes among the entire service area increases urban spatial equity since the
benefits of FFBSS are not a prerogative of just a few zones. For guaranteeing
such distribution, the FFBSS operator can use vans to manually relocate bikes,
but it incurs high economic and environmental costs. We propose a novel
approach that exploits the existing bike flows generated by customers to
distribute bikes. More specifically, by envisioning the problem as an Influence
Maximization problem, we show that it is possible to position batches of bikes
on a small number of zones, and then the daily use of FFBSS will efficiently
spread these bikes on a large area. We show that detecting these zones is
NP-complete, but there exists a simple and efficient $1-1/e$ approximation
algorithm; our approach is then evaluated on a dataset of rides from the
free-floating bike-sharing system of the city of Padova.</span>

                                        <span>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or say drones, are envisioned to support
extensive applications in next-generation wireless networks in both civil and
military fields. Empowering UAVs networks intelligence by artificial
intelligence (AI) especially machine learning (ML) techniques is inevitable and
appealing to enable the aforementioned applications. To solve the problems of
traditional cloud-centric ML for UAV networks such as privacy concern,
unacceptable latency, and resource burden, a distributed ML technique,
\textit(i.e.), federated learning (FL), has been recently proposed to enable
multiple UAVs to collaboratively train ML model without letting out raw data.
However, almost all existing FL paradigms are still centralized, \textit{i.e.},
a central entity is in charge of ML model aggregation and fusion over the whole
network, which could result in the issue of a single point of failure and are
inappropriate to UAV networks with both unreliable nodes and links. Thus
motivated, in this article, we propose a novel architecture called DFL-UN
(\underline{D}ecentralized \underline{F}ederated \underline{L}earning for
\underline{U}AV \underline{N}etworks), which enables FL within UAV networks
without a central entity. We also conduct a preliminary simulation study to
validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DFL-UN architecture. Finally,
we discuss the main challenges and potential research directions in the DFL-UN.</span>

                                        <span>Modern computer vision applications suffer from catastrophic forgetting when
incrementally learning new concepts over time. The most successful approaches
to alleviate this forgetting require extensive replay of previously seen data,
which is problematic when memory constraints or data legality concerns exist.
In this work, we consider the high-impact problem of Data-Free
Class-Incremental Learning (DFCIL), where an incremental learning agent must
learn new concepts over time without storing generators or training data from
past tasks. One approach for DFCIL is to replay synthetic images produced by
inverting a frozen copy of the learner&#x27;s classification model, but we show this
approach fails for common class-incremental benchmarks when using standard
distillation strategies. We diagnose the cause of this failure and propose a
novel incremental distillation strategy for DFCIL, contributing a modified
cross-entropy training and importance-weighted feature distillation, and show
that our method results in up to a 25.1% increase in final task accuracy
(absolute difference) compared to SOTA DFCIL methods for common
class-incremental benchmarks. Our method even outperforms several standard
replay based methods which store a coreset of images.</span>

                                        <span>A myriad of recent breakthroughs in hand-crafted neural architectures for
visual recognition have highlighted the urgent need to explore hybrid
architectures consisting of diversified building blocks. Meanwhile, neural
architecture search methods are surging with an expectation to reduce human
efforts. However, whether NAS methods can efficiently and effectively handle
diversified search spaces with disparate candidates (e.g. CNNs and
transformers) is still an open question. In this work, we present Block-wisely
Self-supervised Neural Architecture Search (BossNAS), an unsupervised NAS
method that addresses the problem of inaccurate architecture rating caused by
large weight-sharing space and biased supervision in previous methods. More
specifically, we factorize the search space into blocks and utilize a novel
self-supervised training scheme, named ensemble bootstrapping, to train each
block separately before searching them as a whole towards the population
center. Additionally, we present HyTra search space, a fabric-like hybrid
CNN-transformer search space with searchable down-sampling positions. On this
challenging search space, our searched model, BossNet-T, achieves up to 82.5%
accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing EfficientNet by 2.4% with comparable compute
time. Moreover, our method achieves superior architecture rating accuracy with
0.78 and 0.76 Spearman correlation on the canonical MBConv search space with
ImageNet and on NATS-Bench size search space with CIFAR-100, respectively,
surpassing state-of-the-art NAS methods. Code:

                                        <span>Collecting labeled data for the task of semantic segmentation is expensive
and time-consuming, as it requires dense pixel-level annotations. While recent
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic segmentation approaches have
achieved impressive results by using large amounts of labeled training data,
their performance drops significantly as the amount of labeled data decreases.
This happens because deep CNNs trained with the de facto cross-entropy loss can
easily overfit to small amounts of labeled data. To address this issue, we
propose a simple and effective contrastive learning-based training strategy in
which we first pretrain the network using a pixel-wise, label-based contrastive
loss, and then fine-tune it using the cross-entropy loss. This approach
increases intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby
resulting in a better pixel classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed training strategy using the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
segmentation datasets. Our results show that pretraining with the proposed
contrastive loss results in large performance gains (more than 20% absolute
improvement in some settings) when the amount of labeled data is limited. In
many settings, the proposed contrastive pretraining strategy, which does not
use any additional data, is able to match or outperform the widely-used
ImageNet pretraining strategy that uses more than a million additional labeled
images.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, a novel framework for guaranteeing ultra-reliable millimeter
wave (mmW) communications using multiple artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed. The use of multiple
AI-powered RISs allows changing the propagation direction of the signals
transmitted from a mmW access point (AP) thereby improving coverage
particularly for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. However, due to the
possibility of highly stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an
intelligent controller to jointly optimize the mmW AP beam and RIS phase shifts
is a daunting task. In this regard, first, a parametric risk-sensitive episodic
return is proposed to maximize the expected bit rate and mitigate the risk of
mmW link blockage. Then, a closed-form approximation of the policy gradient of
the risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. Next, the problem
of joint beamforming for mmW AP and phase shift control for mmW RISs is modeled
as an identical payoff stochastic game within a cooperative multi-agent
environment, in which the agents are the mmW AP and the RISs. Two centralized
and distributed controllers are proposed to control the policies of the mmW AP
and RISs. To directly find an optimal solution, the parametric functional-form
policies for these controllers are modeled using deep recurrent neural networks
(RNNs). Simulation results show that the error between policies of the optimal
and the RNN-based controllers is less than 1.5%. Moreover, the variance of the
achievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based controllers is 60% less than
the variance of the risk-averse baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been tremendously successful in
solving imaging inverse problems. To understand their success, an effective
strategy is to construct simpler and mathematically more tractable
convolutional sparse coding (CSC) models that share essential ingredients with
CNNs. Existing CSC methods, however, underperform leading CNNs in challenging
inverse problems. We hypothesize that the performance gap may be attributed in
part to how they process images at different spatial scales: While many CNNs
use multiscale feature representations, existing CSC models mostly rely on
single-scale dictionaries. To close the performance gap, we thus propose a
multiscale convolutional dictionary structure. The proposed dictionary
structure is derived from the U-Net, arguably the most versatile and widely
used CNN for image-to-image learning problems. We show that incorporating the
proposed multiscale dictionary in an otherwise standard CSC framework yields
performance competitive with state-of-the-art CNNs across a range of
challenging inverse problems including CT and MRI reconstruction. Our work thus
demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of the multiscale CSC approach
in solving challenging inverse problems.</span>

first briefly introduce the basics of vehicular networks and different types of

requirements. We classify the ML techniques developed in the literature
according to their use in vehicular network applications. We explain the

imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which
improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by
how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This
proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon
estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field
measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation
project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite
imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by up to 10-times for tropical
reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and
satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial
imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a
global benchmark between options for carbon measurements.</span>

sophisticated meta-learning methods for few-shot image classification. We take
this hypothesis to its logical conclusion, and suggest the use of an ensemble
of high-quality, pre-trained feature extractors for few-shot image
classification. We show experimentally that a library of pre-trained feature
extractors combined with a simple feed-forward network learned with an

                                        <span>Pushing is a fundamental robotic skill. Existing work has shown how to
exploit models of pushing to achieve a variety of tasks, including grasping
under uncertainty, in-hand manipulation and clearing clutter. Such models,
however, are approximate, which limits their applicability. Learning-based
methods can reason directly from raw sensory data with accuracy, and have the
potential to generalize to a wider diversity of scenarios. However, developing
and testing such methods requires rich-enough datasets. In this paper we
introduce Omnipush, a dataset with high variety of planar pushing behavior. In
particular, we provide 250 pushes for each of 250 objects, all recorded with
RGB-D and a high precision tracking system. The objects are constructed so as
to systematically explore key factors that affect pushing -- the shape of the
object and its mass distribution -- which have not been broadly explored in
previous datasets, and allow to study generalization in model learning.
Omnipush includes a benchmark for meta-learning dynamic models, which requires
algorithms that make good predictions and estimate their own uncertainty. We
also provide an RGB video prediction benchmark and propose other relevant tasks
that can be suited with this dataset.

adversarial attacks. Previous works suggest that overfitting is a dominant
phenomenon in adversarial training leading to a large generalization gap
between test and train accuracy in neural networks. In this work, we show that
the observed generalization gap is closely related to the choice of the
activation function. In particular, we show that using activation functions
with low (exact or approximate) curvature values has a regularization effect
that significantly reduces both the standard and robust generalization gaps in
adversarial training. We observe this effect for both differentiable/smooth
activations such as SiLU as well as non-differentiable/non-smooth activations
such as LeakyReLU. In the latter case, the &quot;approximate&quot; curvature of the
activation is low. Finally, we show that for activation functions with low
curvature, the double descent phenomenon for adversarially trained models does
not occur.</span>

                                        <span>Software often produces biased outputs. In particular, machine learning (ML)
based software are known to produce erroneous predictions when processing
discriminatory inputs. Such unfair program behavior can be caused by societal
bias. In the last few years, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have provided
software services that produce unfair outputs, mostly due to societal bias
(e.g. gender or race). In such events, developers are saddled with the task of
conducting fairness testing. Fairness testing is challenging; developers are
tasked with generating discriminatory inputs that reveal and explain biases.

We propose a grammar-based fairness testing approach (called ASTRAEA) which
leverages context-free grammars to generate discriminatory inputs that reveal
fairness violations in software systems. Using probabilistic grammars, ASTRAEA
also provides fault diagnosis by isolating the cause of observed software bias.
ASTRAEA&#x27;s diagnoses facilitate the improvement of ML fairness.

ASTRAEA was evaluated on 18 software systems that provide three major natural
language processing (NLP) services. In our evaluation, ASTRAEA generated
fairness violations with a rate of ~18%. ASTRAEA generated over 573K
discriminatory test cases and found over 102K fairness violations. Furthermore,
ASTRAEA improves software fairness by ~76%, via model-retraining.</span>

joint stratification and sample allocation problem. In this problem, atomic
strata are partitioned into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
strata. Each stratification is a solution, the quality of which is measured by
its cost. The Bell number of possible solutions is enormous for even a moderate
number of atomic strata and an additional layer of complexity is added with the
evaluation time of each solution. Many larger scale combinatorial optimisation
problems cannot be solved to optimality because the search for an optimum
solution requires a prohibitive amount of computation time; a number of local
search heuristic algorithms have been designed for this problem but these can
become trapped in local minima preventing any further improvements. We add to
the existing suite of local search algorithms a simulated annealing algorithm
that allows for an escape from local minima and uses delta evaluation to
exploit the similarity between consecutive solutions and thereby reduce the
evaluation time. We compare the simulated annealing algorithm with two recent
algorithms. In both cases the SAA attains a solution of comparable quality in
considerably less computation time.</span>

Metropolis--Hastings algorithm to sample from doubly-intractable distributions.
However, the theoretical exploration of the exchange algorithm is very limited.
For example, natural questions like &#x60;Does exchange algorithm converge at a
geometric rate?&#x27; or &#x60;Does the exchange algorithm admit a Central Limit
Theorem?&#x27; have not been answered yet. In this paper, we study the theoretical
properties of the exchange algorithm, in terms of asymptotic variance and
convergence speed. We compare the exchange algorithm with the original
Metropolis--Hastings algorithm and provide both necessary and sufficient
conditions for the geometric ergodicity of the exchange algorithm. Moreover, we
prove that our results can be applied to various practical applications such as
location models, Gaussian models, Poisson models, and a large class of
exponential families, which includes most of the practical applications of the
exchange algorithm. A central limit theorem for the exchange algorithm is also
established. Our results justify the theoretical usefulness of the exchange
algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently gained a surge of interest within
the computer vision community for its power to synthesize photorealistic novel
views of real-world scenes. One limitation of NeRF, however, is its requirement
of accurate camera poses to learn the scene representations. In this paper, we
propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from
imperfect (or even unknown) camera poses -- the joint problem of learning
neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a
theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that
coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show
that na\&quot;ively applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on
registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene
representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time.
This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown
camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g.
SLAM) and potential applications for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>From CNNs to attention mechanisms, encoding inductive biases into neural
networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.</span>

                                        <span>This paper aims to demonstrate the efficiency of the Adversarial Open Domain
Adaption framework for sketch-to-photo synthesis. The unsupervised open domain
adaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is
challenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The
absence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the
freehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that
learns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the
missing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between
synthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings
may produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking
classes. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain
sampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering
false drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo
and photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On
the Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most
current competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model
outperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and
retaining the structural layout.</span>

problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem is intractable and inefficient
beyond a few hundreds of nodes. While state-of-the-art Machine Learning
approaches perform closely to classical solvers when trained on trivially small
sizes, they are unable to generalize the learnt policy to larger instances of
practical scales. Towards leveraging transfer learning to solve large-scale
TSPs, this paper identifies inductive biases, model architectures and learning
algorithms that promote generalization to instances larger than those seen in
training. Our controlled experiments provide the first principled investigation
into such zero-shot generalization, revealing that extrapolating beyond
training data requires rethinking the neural combinatorial optimization
pipeline, from network layers and learning paradigms to evaluation protocols.</span>

where the divergence is shown to be a linear combination of the variational
difference defined on the clean distribution and a bias term introduced due to
the noise. The above derivation helps us analyze the robustness of different
$f$-divergence functions. With established robustness, this family of
$f$-divergence functions arises as useful metrics for the problem of learning
with noisy labels, which do not require the specification of the labels&#x27; noise
rate. When they are possibly not robust, we propose fixes to make them so. In

high-quality speech synthesis, there are still several factors that degrade the
quality of synthesized speech, including lack of training data or information
loss during knowledge distillation. To address the problem, we propose a novel
way to train a TTS model under the supervision of perceptual loss, which
measures the distance between the maximum speech quality score and the
predicted one. We first pre-train a mean opinion score (MOS) prediction model
and then train a TTS model in the direction of maximizing the MOS of
synthesized speech predicted by the pre-trained MOS prediction model. Through
this method, we can improve the quality of synthesized speech universally
(i.e., regardless of the network architecture or the cause of the speech
quality degradation) and efficiently (i.e., without increasing the inference
time or the model complexity). The evaluation results for MOS and phone error
rate demonstrate that our proposed approach improves previous models in terms
of both naturalness and intelligibility.</span>

and its continuous mutation, it is of pivotal importance to design a system to
identify different known (and unknown) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Identifying
particular variants helps to understand and model their spread patterns, design
effective mitigation strategies, and prevent future outbreaks. It also plays a
crucial role in studying the efficacy of known vaccines against each variant
and modeling the likelihood of breakthrough infections. It is well known that
the spike protein contains most of the information/variation pertaining to
coronavirus variants.

In this paper, we use spike sequences to classify different variants of the
coronavirus in humans. We show that preserving the order of the amino acids
helps the underlying classifiers to achieve better performance. We also show
that we can train our model to outperform the baseline algorithms using only a
small number of training samples ($1\%$ of the data). Finally, we show the
importance of the different amino acids which play a key role in identifying
variants and how they coincide with those reported by the USA&#x27;s Centers for

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have so far been the de-facto model for
visual data. Recent work has shown that (Vision) Transformer models (ViT) can
achieve comparable or even superior performance on image classification tasks.
This raises a central question: how are Vision Transformers solving these
tasks? Are they acting like convolutional networks, or learning entirely
different visual representations? Analyzing the internal representation
structure of ViTs and CNNs on image classification benchmarks, we find striking
differences between the two architectures, such as ViT having more uniform
representations across all layers. We explore how these differences arise,
finding crucial roles played by self-attention, which enables early aggregation
of global information, and ViT residual connections, which strongly propagate
features from lower to higher layers. We study the ramifications for spatial
localization, demonstrating ViTs successfully preserve input spatial
information, with noticeable effects from different classification methods.
Finally, we study the effect of (pretraining) dataset scale on intermediate
features and transfer learning, and conclude with a discussion on connections
to new architectures such as the MLP-Mixer.</span>

                                        <span>Computing systems form the backbone of many aspects of our life, hence they
are becoming as vital as water, electricity, and road infrastructures for our
society. Yet, engineering long running computing systems that achieve their
goals in ever-changing environments pose significant challenges. Currently, we
can build computing systems that adjust or learn over time to match changes
that were anticipated. However, dealing with unanticipated changes, such as
anomalies, novelties, new goals or constraints, requires system evolution,
which remains in essence a human-driven activity. Given the growing complexity
of computing systems and the vast amount of highly complex data to process,
this approach will eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status
quo, we put forward a new paradigm for the design and operation of computing
systems that we coin &quot;lifelong computing.&quot; The paradigm starts from
computing-learning systems that integrate computing/service modules and
learning modules. Computing warehouses offer such computing elements together
with data sheets and usage guides. When detecting anomalies, novelties, new
goals or constraints, a lifelong computing system activates an evolutionary
self-learning engine that runs online experiments to determine how the
computing-learning system needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby
changing its architecture and integrating new computing elements from computing
warehouses as needed. Depending on the domain at hand, some activities of
lifelong computing systems can be supported by humans. We motivate the need for
lifelong computing with a future fish farming scenario, outline a blueprint
architecture for lifelong computing systems, and highlight key research
challenges to realise the vision of lifelong computing.</span>

                                        <span>The selection of coarse-grained (CG) mapping operators is a critical step for
CG molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is still an open question about what
is optimal for this choice and there is a need for theory. The current
state-of-the art method is mapping operators manually selected by experts. In
this work, we demonstrate an automated approach by viewing this problem as
supervised learning where we seek to reproduce the mapping operators produced
by experts. We present a graph neural network based CG mapping predictor called
DEEP SUPERVISED GRAPH PARTITIONING MODEL(DSGPM) that treats mapping operators
as a graph segmentation problem. DSGPM is trained on a novel dataset,
Human-annotated Mappings (HAM), consisting of 1,206 molecules with expert
annotated mapping operators. HAM can be used to facilitate further research in
this area. Our model uses a novel metric learning objective to produce
high-quality atomic features that are used in spectral clustering. The results
show that the DSGPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the field of graph
segmentation. Finally, we find that predicted CG mapping operators indeed
result in good CG MD models when used in simulation.</span>

                                        <span>We initiate the study of quantum algorithms for escaping from saddle points
with provable guarantee. Given a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}$,
our quantum algorithm outputs an $\epsilon$-approximate second-order stationary
point using $\tilde{O}(\log^{2} (n)/\epsilon^{1.75})$ queries to the quantum
evaluation oracle (i.e., the zeroth-order oracle). Compared to the classical
state-of-the-art algorithm by Jin et al. with $\tilde{O}(\log^{6}
(n)/\epsilon^{1.75})$ queries to the gradient oracle (i.e., the first-order
oracle), our quantum algorithm is polynomially better in terms of $\log n$ and
matches its complexity in terms of $1/\epsilon$. Technically, our main
contribution is the idea of replacing the classical perturbations in gradient
descent methods by simulating quantum wave equations, which constitutes the
improvement in the quantum query complexity with $\log n$ factors for escaping
from saddle points. We also show how to use a quantum gradient computation
algorithm due to Jordan to replace the classical gradient queries by quantum
evaluation queries with the same complexity. Finally, we also perform numerical
experiments that support our theoretical findings.</span>

                                        <span>Kernels ensuing from tree ensembles such as random forest (RF) or gradient
boosted trees (GBT), when used for kernel learning, have been shown to be
competitive to their respective tree ensembles (particularly in higher
dimensional scenarios). On the other hand, it has been also shown that
performance of the kernel algorithms depends on the degree of the kernel-target
alignment. However, the kernel-target alignment for kernel learning based on
the tree ensembles has not been investigated and filling this gap is the main
goal of our work.

Using the eigenanalysis of the kernel matrix, we demonstrate that for
continuous targets good performance of the tree-based kernel learning is
associated with strong kernel-target alignment. Moreover, we show that well
performing tree ensemble based kernels are characterized by strong target
aligned components that are expressed through scalar products between the
eigenvectors of the kernel matrix and the target. This suggests that when tree
ensemble based kernel learning is successful, relevant information for the
supervised problem is concentrated near lower dimensional manifold spanned by
the target aligned components. Persistence of the strong target aligned
components in tree ensemble based kernels is further supported by sensitivity
analysis via landmark learning. In addition to a comprehensive simulation
study, we also provide experimental results from several real life data sets
that are in line with the simulations.</span>

                                        <span>The proposed method re-frames traditional inverse problems of
electrocardiography into regression problems, constraining the solution space
by decomposing signals with multidimensional Gaussian impulse basis functions.
Impulse HSPs were generated with single Gaussian basis functions at discrete
heart surface locations and projected to corresponding BSPs using a volume
conductor torso model. Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to
regular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural network. Predictive
capabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental
data. A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to
map body surface impulses to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for
reconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across the heart surface were
predicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of $9.1\pm1.4$%.
Predicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to
displacement and rotation of the heart within the torso were bounded and
predictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4\%
increase in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse
function data could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded
HSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time
Gaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean
absolute error of $10.4\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with
similar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are
potentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data
models for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the
neural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively
identify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent
treatment options.</span>

representations learned through this paradigm, much is yet to be understood
about how different training methods and datasets influence performance on
downstream tasks. In this paper, we analyze contrastive approaches as one of
the most successful and popular variants of self-supervised representation
learning. We perform this analysis from the perspective of the training

experiments including 30 encoders, 4 pre-training datasets and 20 diverse
downstream tasks. Our experiments address various questions regarding the

the model performance on a budget. One such algorithm is Expected Gradient
Length, which as the name suggests uses the approximate gradient induced per
example in the sampling process. While Expected Gradient Length has been
successfully used for classification and regression, the formulation for
regression remains intuitively driven. Hence, our theoretical contribution
involves deriving this formulation, thereby supporting the experimental
evidence. Subsequently, we show that expected gradient length in regression is
equivalent to Bayesian uncertainty. If certain assumptions are infeasible, our
algorithmic contribution (EGL++) approximates the effect of ensembles with a
single deterministic network. Instead of computing multiple possible inferences
per input, we leverage previously annotated samples to quantify the probability
of previous labels being the true label. Such an approach allows us to extend
expected gradient length to a new task: human pose estimation. We perform
experimental validation on two human pose datasets (MPII and LSP/LSPET),
highlighting the interpretability and competitiveness of EGL++ with different
active learning algorithms for human pose estimation.</span>

                                        <span>The world is going through a challenging phase due to the disastrous effect
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and the economy. The
rate of spreading, post-COVID-19 symptoms, and the occurrence of new strands of
COVID-19 have put the healthcare systems in disruption across the globe. Due to
this, the task of accurately screening COVID-19 cases has become of utmost
priority. Since the virus infects the respiratory system, Chest X-Ray is an
imaging modality that is adopted extensively for the initial screening. We have
performed a comprehensive study that uses CXR images to identify COVID-19 cases
and realized the necessity of having a more generalizable model. We utilize
MobileNetV2 architecture as the feature extractor and integrate it into Capsule
Networks to construct a fully automated and lightweight model termed as
MobileCaps. MobileCaps is trained and evaluated on the publicly available
dataset with the model ensembling and Bayesian optimization strategies to
efficiently classify CXR images of patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19
pneumonia and healthy cases. The proposed model is further evaluated on two
additional RT-PCR confirmed datasets to demonstrate the generalizability. We
also introduce MobileCaps-S and leverage it for performing severity assessment
of CXR images of COVID-19 based on the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema
(RALE) scoring technique. Our classification model achieved an overall recall
of 91.60, 94.60, 92.20, and a precision of 98.50, 88.21, 92.62 for COVID-19,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy cases, respectively. Further, the severity
assessment model attained an R$^2$ coefficient of 70.51. Owing to the fact that
the proposed models have fewer trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art
models reported in the literature, we believe our models will go a long way in
aiding healthcare systems in the battle against the pandemic.</span>

                                        <span>Class imbalance is an inherent problem in many machine learning
classification tasks. This often leads to trained models that are unusable for
any practical purpose. In this study we explore an unsupervised approach to
address these imbalances by leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained image
classification models to encoder-based Generative Adversarial Network (eGAN).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this problem
using GAN without needing to augment with synthesized fake images.

In the proposed approach we use the discriminator network to output a
negative or positive score. We classify as minority, test samples with negative
scores and as majority those with positive scores. Our approach eliminates
epistemic uncertainty in model predictions, as the P(minority) + P(majority)
need not sum up to 1. The impact of transfer learning and combinations of
different pre-trained image classification models at the generator and
discriminator is also explored. Best result of 0.69 F1-score was obtained on
CIFAR-10 classification task with imbalance ratio of 1:2500.

Our approach also provides a mechanism of thresholding the specificity or
sensitivity of our machine learning system. Keywords: Class imbalance, Transfer

potential for use in nonseasonal time-series similar to those in the early days
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Developing improved forecast methods is essential as
they provide data-driven decisions to organisations and decision-makers during
critical phases. We propose using late data fusion, using a stacked ensemble of
two forecasting models and two meta-features that prove their predictive power
during a preliminary forecasting stage. The final ensembles include a Prophet

models are combined by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), taking into account
meta-features that indicate the highest correlation with each base model&#x27;s
forecast accuracy. We further show that the inclusion of meta-features
generally improves the ensemble&#x27;s forecast accuracy across two forecast
horizons of seven and fourteen days. This research reinforces previous work and
demonstrates the value of combining traditional statistical models with deep

                                        <span>Large-scale, two-sided matching platforms must find market outcomes that
align with user preferences while simultaneously learning these preferences
from data. However, since preferences are inherently uncertain during learning,
the classical notion of stability (Gale and Shapley, 1962; Shapley and Shubik,
1971) is unattainable in these settings. To bridge this gap, we develop a
framework and algorithms for learning stable market outcomes under uncertainty.
Our primary setting is matching with transferable utilities, where the platform
both matches agents and sets monetary transfers between them. We design an
incentive-aware learning objective that captures the distance of a market
outcome from equilibrium. Using this objective, we analyze the complexity of
learning as a function of preference structure, casting learning as a
stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Algorithmically, we show that &quot;optimism
in the face of uncertainty,&quot; the principle underlying many bandit algorithms,
applies to a primal-dual formulation of matching with transfers and leads to
near-optimal regret bounds. Our work takes a first step toward elucidating when
and how stable matchings arise in large, data-driven marketplaces.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) has become a commodity in our every-day lives. We
routinely ask ML empowered smartphones to suggest lovely food places or to
guide us through a strange place. ML methods have also become standard tools in
many fields of science and engineering. A plethora of ML applications transform
human lives at unprecedented pace and scale. This book portrays ML as the
combination of three basic components: data, model and loss. ML methods combine
these three components within computationally efficient implementations of the
basic scientific principle &quot;trial and error&quot;. This principle consists of the
continuous adaptation of a hypothesis about a phenomenon that generates data.
ML methods use a hypothesis to compute predictions for future events. We
believe that thinking about ML as combinations of three components given by
data, model, and loss helps to navigate the steadily growing offer for
ready-to-use ML methods. Our three-component picture of ML allows a unified
treatment of a wide range of concepts and techniques which seem quite unrelated
at first sight. The regularization effect of early stopping in iterative
methods is due to the shrinking of the effective hypothesis space.
Privacy-preserving ML is obtained by particular choices for the features of
data points. Explainable ML methods are characterized by particular choices for
the hypothesis space. To make good use of ML tools it is instrumental to
understand its underlying principles at different levels of detail. On a lower
level, this tutorial helps ML engineers to choose suitable methods for the
application at hand. The book also offers a higher-level view on the
implementation of ML methods which is typically required to manage a team of ML
engineers and data scientists.</span>

planning and decision-making. These quantitative approaches can add value
beyond traditional methods that do not rely on data and are particularly
relevant for public transportation. Lagos is experiencing rapid urbanization
and currently has a population of just under 15 million. Both long waiting
times and uncertain travel times has driven many people to acquire their own
vehicle or use alternative modes of transport. This has significantly increased
the number of vehicles on the roads leading to even more traffic and greater
traffic congestion. This paper investigates urban travel demand in Lagos and
explores passenger dynamics in time and space. Using individual commuter trip
data from tickets purchased from the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the
demand patterns through the hours of the day, days of the week and bus stations
are analysed. This study aims to quantify demand from actual passenger trips
and estimate the impact that dynamic scheduling could have on passenger waiting
times. Station segmentation is provided to cluster stations by their demand
characteristics in order to tailor specific bus schedules. Intra-day public
transportation demand in Lagos BRT is analysed and predictions are compared.
Simulations using fixed and dynamic bus scheduling demonstrate that the average
waiting time could be reduced by as much as 80%. The load curves, insights and
the approach developed will be useful for informing policymaking in Lagos and
similar African cities facing the challenges of rapid urbanization.</span>

the spectrum analysis method to extract the Cs-137 concentration. And when in
poor statistic situation, the calculation result of the traditional net peak
area (NPA) method has a large uncertainty. We present a machine learning based
method to better analyze the gamma-ray spectrum with low Cs-137 concentration.
We apply multilayer perceptron (MLP) to analyze the 662 keV full energy peak of
Cs-137 in the seawater spectrum. And the MLP can be trained with a few measured
background spectrums by combining the simulated Cs-137 signal with measured
background spectrums. Thus, it can save the time of preparing and measuring the
standard samples for generating the training dataset. To validate the MLP-based
method, we use Geant4 and background gamma-ray spectrums measured by a seaborne
monitoring device to generate an independent test dataset to test the result by
our method and the traditional NPA method. We find that the MLP-based method
achieves a root mean squared error of 0.159, 2.3 times lower than that of the
traditional net peak area method, indicating the MLP-based method improves the

evolution between two probability distributions given a prior stochastic
evolution. As well as applications in the natural sciences, problems of this
kind have important applications in machine learning such as dataset alignment
and hypothesis testing. Whilst the theory behind this problem is relatively
mature, scalable numerical recipes to estimate the Schr\&quot;odinger bridge remain
an active area of research. We prove an equivalence between the SBP and maximum

                                        <span>A core objective of the TERRA-REF project was to generate an open-access
reference dataset for the evaluation of sensing technologies to study plants
under field conditions. The TERRA-REF program deployed a suite of
high-resolution, cutting edge technology sensors on a gantry system with the
aim of scanning 1 hectare (10$^4$) at around 1 mm$^2$ spatial resolution
multiple times per week. The system contains co-located sensors including a
stereo-pair RGB camera, a thermal imager, a laser scanner to capture 3D
structure, and two hyperspectral cameras covering wavelengths of 300-2500nm.
This sensor data is provided alongside over sixty types of traditional plant
phenotype measurements that can be used to train new machine learning models.
Associated weather and environmental measurements, information about agronomic
management and experimental design, and the genomic sequences of hundreds of
plant varieties have been collected and are available alongside the sensor and
plant phenotype data.

Over the course of four years and ten growing seasons, the TERRA-REF system
generated over 1 PB of sensor data and almost 45 million files. The subset that
has been released to the public domain accounts for two seasons and about half
of the total data volume. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for
investigations far beyond the core biological scope of the project.

The focus of this paper is to provide the Computer Vision and Machine
Learning communities an overview of the available data and some potential
applications of this one of a kind data.</span>

practice, but are not so well-understood theoretically. We propose a new
offline actor-critic algorithm that naturally incorporates the pessimism
principle, leading to several key advantages compared to the state of the art.
The algorithm can operate when the Bellman evaluation operator is closed with
respect to the action value function of the actor&#x27;s policies; this is a more
general setting than the low-rank MDP model. Despite the added generality, the
procedure is computationally tractable as it involves the solution of a
sequence of second-order programs. We prove an upper bound on the suboptimality
gap of the policy returned by the procedure that depends on the data coverage
of any arbitrary, possibly data dependent comparator policy. The achievable
guarantee is complemented with a minimax lower bound that is matching up to
logarithmic factors.</span>

with outlier data that is far removed from their training distributions.
Likelihoods computed by deep generative models are a candidate metric for
outlier detection with unlabeled data. Yet, previous studies have shown that
such likelihoods are unreliable and can be easily biased by simple
transformations to input data. Here, we examine outlier detection with
variational autoencoders (VAEs), among the simplest class of deep generative
models. First, we show that a theoretically-grounded correction readily
ameliorates a key bias with VAE likelihood estimates. The bias correction is
model-free, sample-specific, and accurately computed with the Bernoulli and
continuous Bernoulli visible distributions. Second, we show that a well-known
preprocessing technique, contrast normalization, extends the effectiveness of
bias correction to natural image datasets. Third, we show that the variance of
the likelihoods computed over an ensemble of VAEs also enables robust outlier
detection. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of our remedies with nine
(grayscale and natural) image datasets, and demonstrate significant advantages,
in terms of both speed and accuracy, over four other state-of-the-art methods.
Our lightweight remedies are biologically inspired and may serve to achieve
efficient outlier detection with many types of deep generative models.</span>

of parameters required to be calibrated increases. This parameter expansion
leads to the ABMS equivalent of the \say{curse of dimensionality}. In
particular, infeasible computational requirements searching an infinite

that can effectively swap out parameterisation strategies and surrogate models

                                        <span>Machine learning is gaining popularity in a broad range of areas working with
geographic data, such as ecology or atmospheric sciences. Here, data often
exhibit spatial effects, which can be difficult to learn for neural networks.
In this study, we propose SXL, a method for embedding information on the
autoregressive nature of spatial data directly into the learning process using
auxiliary tasks. We utilize the local Moran&#x27;s I, a popular measure of local
spatial autocorrelation, to &quot;nudge&quot; the model to learn the direction and
magnitude of local spatial effects, complementing the learning of the primary
task. We further introduce a novel expansion of Moran&#x27;s I to multiple
resolutions, thus capturing spatial interactions over longer and shorter
distances simultaneously. The novel multi-resolution Moran&#x27;s I can be
constructed easily and as a multi-dimensional tensor offers seamless
integration into existing machine learning frameworks. Throughout a range of
experiments using real-world data, we highlight how our method consistently
improves the training of neural networks in unsupervised and supervised
learning tasks. In generative spatial modeling experiments, we propose a novel
loss for auxiliary task GANs utilizing task uncertainty weights. Our proposed
method outperforms domain-specific spatial interpolation benchmarks,
highlighting its potential for downstream applications. This study bridges
expertise from geographic information science and machine learning, showing how
this integration of disciplines can help to address domain-specific challenges.

                                        <span>Attention mechanism has demonstrated great potential in fine-grained visual
recognition tasks. In this paper, we present a counterfactual attention
learning method to learn more effective attention based on causal inference.
Unlike most existing methods that learn visual attention based on conventional
likelihood, we propose to learn the attention with counterfactual causality,
which provides a tool to measure the attention quality and a powerful
supervisory signal to guide the learning process. Specifically, we analyze the
effect of the learned visual attention on network prediction through
counterfactual intervention and maximize the effect to encourage the network to
learn more useful attention for fine-grained image recognition. Empirically, we
evaluate our method on a wide range of fine-grained recognition tasks where
attention plays a crucial role, including fine-grained image categorization,
person re-identification, and vehicle re-identification. The consistent
improvement on all benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

                                        <span>As a decentralized model training method, federated learning is designed to
integrate the isolated data islands and protect data privacy. Recent studies,
however, have demonstrated that the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based
attacks can be used in federated learning to learn the distribution of the
victim&#x27;s private dataset and accordingly reconstruct human-distinguishable
images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in
federated learning, and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers
from learning the real distribution of the victim&#x27;s data. The core idea of
Anti-GAN is to corrupt the visual features of the victim&#x27;s private training
images, such that the images restored by the attacker are indistinguishable to
human eyes. Specifically, in Anti-GAN, the victim first projects the personal
dataset onto a GAN&#x27;s generator, then mixes the fake images generated by the
generator with the real images to obtain the training dataset, which will be
fed into the federated model for training. We redesign the structure of the
victim&#x27;s GAN to encourage it to learn the classification features (instead of
the visual features) of the real images. We further introduce an unsupervised
task to the GAN model for obfuscating the visual features of the generated
images. The experiments demonstrate that Anti-GAN can effectively prevent the
attacker from learning the distribution of the private images, meanwhile
causing little harm to the accuracy of the federated model.</span>

                                        <span>Many tasks in graph machine learning, such as link prediction and node
classification, are typically solved by using representation learning, in which
each node or edge in the network is encoded via an embedding. Though there
exists a lot of network embeddings for static graphs, the task becomes much
more complicated when the dynamic (i.e. temporal) network is analyzed. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for dynamic network representation learning
based on Temporal Graph Network by using a highly custom message generating
function by extracting Causal Anonymous Walks. For evaluation, we provide a
benchmark pipeline for the evaluation of temporal network embeddings. This work
provides the first comprehensive comparison framework for temporal network
representation learning in every available setting for graph machine learning
problems involving node classification and link prediction. The proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. The work also justifies the
difference between them based on evaluation in various transductive/inductive
edge/node classification tasks. In addition, we show the applicability and
superior performance of our model in the real-world downstream graph machine
learning task provided by one of the top European banks, involving credit
scoring based on transaction data.</span>

show that for class weighted (where the accuracy for one class is more

                                        <span>In generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), the agent aims to learn
a policy from an expert demonstration so that its performance cannot be
discriminated from the expert policy on a certain predefined reward set. In
this paper, we study GAIL in both online and offline settings with linear
function approximation, where both the transition and reward function are
linear in the feature maps. Besides the expert demonstration, in the online
setting the agent can interact with the environment, while in the offline
setting the agent only accesses an additional dataset collected by a prior. For
online GAIL, we propose an optimistic generative adversarial policy
optimization algorithm (OGAP) and prove that OGAP achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2 d^{3/2}K^{1/2}+KH^{3/2}dN_1^{-1/2})$ regret. Here
$N_1$ represents the number of trajectories of the expert demonstration, $d$ is
the feature dimension, and $K$ is the number of episodes.

For offline GAIL, we propose a pessimistic generative adversarial policy
optimization algorithm (PGAP). For an arbitrary additional dataset, we obtain
the optimality gap of PGAP, achieving the minimax lower bound in the
utilization of the additional dataset. Assuming sufficient coverage on the
additional dataset, we show that PGAP achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^{2}dK^{-1/2}
+H^2d^{3/2}N_2^{-1/2}+H^{3/2}dN_1^{-1/2} \ )$ optimality gap. Here $N_2$

economic scenario generation approaches conditional on forward looking market
data. Such PiT ESGs should provide quicker and more flexible reactions to

of sample forecasting quality with a strategy backtest using model output as

tasks in graphs reaching state-of-the-art results. However, little work was
dedicated to creating unbiased GNNs, i.e., where the classification is
uncorrelated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. Some ignore the
sensitive attributes or optimize for the criteria of statistical parity for
fairness. However, it has been shown that neither approaches ensure fairness,
but rather cripple the utility of the prediction task. In this work, we present
a GNN framework that allows optimizing representations for the notion of
Equalized Odds fairness criteria. The architecture is composed of three
components: (1) a GNN classifier predicting the utility class, (2) a sampler
learning the distribution of the sensitive attributes of the nodes given their
labels. It generates samples fed into a (3) discriminator that discriminates
between true and sampled sensitive attributes using a novel &quot;permutation loss&quot;
function. Using these components, we train a model to neglect information
regarding the sensitive attribute only with respect to its label. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to optimize GNNs for the equalized odds
criteria. We evaluate our classifier over several graph datasets and sensitive
attributes and show our algorithm reaches state-of-the-art results.</span>

                                        <span>Virtual Reality (VR) games that feature physical activities have been shown
to increase players&#x27; motivation to do physical exercise. However, for such
exercises to have a positive healthcare effect, they have to be repeated
several times a week. To maintain player motivation over longer periods of
time, games often employ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to adapt the
game&#x27;s challenge according to the player&#x27;s capabilities. For exercise games,
this is mostly done by tuning specific in-game parameters like the speed of
objects. In this work, we propose to use experience-driven Procedural Content
Generation for DDA in VR exercise games by procedurally generating levels that
match the player&#x27;s current capabilities. Not only finetuning specific
parameters but creating completely new levels has the potential to decrease
repetition over longer time periods and allows for the simultaneous adaptation
of the cognitive and physical challenge of the exergame. As a proof-of-concept,
we implement an initial prototype in which the player must traverse a maze that
includes several exercise rooms, whereby the generation of the maze is realized
by a neural network. Passing those exercise rooms requires the player to
perform physical activities. To match the player&#x27;s capabilities, we use Deep
Reinforcement Learning to adjust the structure of the maze and to decide which
exercise rooms to include in the maze. We evaluate our prototype in an
exploratory user study utilizing both biodata and subjective questionnaires.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we study the problem of Novel Class Discovery (NCD). NCD aims
at inferring novel object categories in an unlabeled set by leveraging from
prior knowledge of a labeled set containing different, but related classes.
Existing approaches tackle this problem by considering multiple objective
functions, usually involving specialized loss terms for the labeled and the
unlabeled samples respectively, and often requiring auxiliary regularization
terms. In this paper, we depart from this traditional scheme and introduce a
UNified Objective function (UNO) for discovering novel classes, with the
explicit purpose of favoring synergy between supervised and unsupervised
learning. Using a multi-view self-labeling strategy, we generate pseudo-labels
that can be treated homogeneously with ground truth labels. This leads to a
single classification objective operating on both known and unknown classes.
Despite its simplicity, UNO outperforms the state of the art by a significant
margin on several benchmarks (~+10% on CIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet). The

                                        <span>In recent years, gradient boosted decision trees have become popular in
building robust machine learning models on big data. The primary technique that
has enabled these algorithms success has been distributing the computation
while building the decision trees. A distributed decision tree building, in
turn, has been enabled by building quantiles of the big datasets and choosing
the candidate split points from these quantile sets. In XGBoost, for instance,
a sophisticated quantile building algorithm is employed to identify the
candidate split points for the decision trees. This method is often projected
to yield better results when the computation is distributed. In this paper, we
dispel the notion that these methods provide more accurate and scalable methods
for building decision trees in a distributed manner. In a significant
contribution, we show theoretically and empirically that choosing the split
points uniformly at random provides the same or even better performance in
terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Hence, a simple random
selection of points suffices for decision tree building compared to more
sophisticated methods.</span>

as graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied in the sense of
improving recommendation accuracy. However, such attempts have focused mostly
on utilizing only the information of positive user-item interactions with high
ratings. Thus, there is a challenge on how to make use of low rating scores for
representing users&#x27; preferences since low ratings can be still informative in
designing NE-based recommender systems. In this study, we present SiReN, a new
sign-aware recommender system based on GNN models. Specifically, SiReN has
three key components: 1) constructing a signed bipartite graph for more
precisely representing users&#x27; preferences, which is split into two
edge-disjoint graphs with positive and negative edges each, 2) generating two
embeddings for the partitioned graphs with positive and negative edges via a
GNN model and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), respectively, and then using an
attention model to obtain the final embeddings, and 3) establishing a
sign-aware Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss function in the process of
optimization. Through comprehensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate
that SiReN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NE-aided recommendation

non-separable fuzzy rules with adaptive shapes is introduced. To reflect the
uncertainty, the shape of fuzzy sets considered to be uncertain. Therefore, a
new form of interval type-2 fuzzy sets based on a general Gaussian model able
to construct different shapes (including triangular, bell-shaped, trapezoidal)
is proposed. To consider the interactions among input variables, input vectors
are transformed to new feature spaces with uncorrelated variables proper for
defining each fuzzy rule. Next, the new features are fed to a fuzzification
layer using proposed interval type-2 fuzzy sets with adaptive shape.
Consequently, interval type-2 non-separable fuzzy rules with proper shapes,
considering the local interactions of variables and the uncertainty are formed.
For type reduction the contribution of the upper and lower firing strengths of
each fuzzy rule are adaptively selected separately. To train different
parameters of the network, the Levenberg-Marquadt optimization method is
utilized. The performance of the proposed method is investigated on clean and
noisy datasets to show the ability to consider the uncertainty. Moreover, the
proposed paradigm, is successfully applied to real-world time-series
predictions, regression problems, and nonlinear system identification.
According to the experimental results, the performance of our proposed model
outperforms other methods with a more parsimonious structure.</span>

(GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for autonomous vehicles (AV) that
consists of two concurrent strategies: (i) detection of vehicle state using
predicted location shift -- i.e., distance traveled between two consecutive
timestamps -- and monitoring of vehicle motion state -- i.e., standstill/ in
motion; and (ii) detection and classification of turns (i.e., left or right).
Data from multiple low-cost in-vehicle sensors (i.e., accelerometer, steering
angle sensor, speed sensor, and GNSS) are fused and fed into a recurrent neural
network model, which is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for predicting
the location shift, i.e., the distance that an AV travels between two
consecutive timestamps. This location shift is then compared with the
GNSS-based location shift to detect an attack. We have then combined k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect and
classify left and right turns using data from the steering angle sensor. To
prove the efficacy of the sensor fusion-based attack detection framework,
attack datasets are created for four unique and sophisticated spoofing
attacks-turn-by-turn, overshoot, wrong turn, and stop, using the publicly
available real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). Our
analysis reveals that the sensor fusion-based detection framework successfully
detects all four types of spoofing attacks within the required computational
latency threshold.</span>

                                        <span>Clustered Federated Multitask Learning (CFL) was introduced as an efficient
scheme to obtain reliable specialized models when data is imbalanced and
distributed in a non-i.i.d. (non-independent and identically distributed)
fashion amongst clients. While a similarity measure metric, like the cosine
similarity, can be used to endow groups of the client with a specialized model,
this process can be arduous as the server should involve all clients in each of
the federated learning rounds. Therefore, it is imperative that a subset of
clients is selected periodically due to the limited bandwidth and latency
constraints at the network edge. To this end, this paper proposes a new client
selection algorithm that aims to accelerate the convergence rate for obtaining
specialized machine learning models that achieve high test accuracies for all
client groups. Specifically, we introduce a client selection approach that
leverages the devices&#x27; heterogeneity to schedule the clients based on their
round latency and exploits the bandwidth reuse for clients that consume more
time to update the model. Then, the server performs model averaging and
clusters the clients based on predefined thresholds. When a specific cluster
reaches a stationary point, the proposed algorithm uses a greedy scheduling
algorithm for that group by selecting the clients with less latency to update
the model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach lowers the
training time and accelerates the convergence rate by up to 50% while imbuing
each client with a specialized model that is fit for its local data
distribution.</span>

flexibility and generalizability, as they only model a single type of
high-order correlation. In practice, multiple multilinear correlations may
exist within the features. In this paper, we present a novel Residual Tensor
Train (ResTT) which integrates the merits of TT and residual structure to
capture the multilinear feature correlations, from low to higher orders, within
the same model. In particular, we prove that the fully-connected layer in
neural networks and the Volterra series can be taken as special cases of ResTT.
Furthermore, we derive the rule for weight initialization that stabilizes the
training of ResTT based on a mean-field analysis. We prove that such a rule is
much more relaxed than that of TT, which means ResTT can easily address the
vanishing and exploding gradient problem that exists in the current TT models.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that ResTT outperforms the state-of-the-art
tensor network approaches, and is competitive with the benchmark deep learning
models on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Point clouds captured in real-world applications are often incomplete due to
the limited sensor resolution, single viewpoint, and occlusion. Therefore,
recovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable
task in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method
that reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem
and design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder
architecture for point cloud completion. By representing the point cloud as a
set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the
point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for
point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the
inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise
a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships
explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn
structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud
completion. Furthermore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with more
diverse incomplete point clouds that can better reflect the real-world
scenarios to promote future research. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both the new
benchmarks and the existing ones. Code is available at

                                        <span>Although LEGO sets have entertained generations of children and adults, the
challenge of designing customized builds matching the complexity of real-world
or imagined scenes remains too great for the average enthusiast. In order to
make this feat possible, we implement a system that generates a LEGO brick
model from 2D images. We design a novel solution to this problem that uses an
octree-structured autoencoder trained on 3D voxelized models to obtain a
feasible latent representation for model reconstruction, and a separate network
trained to predict this latent representation from 2D images. LEGO models are
obtained by algorithmic conversion of the 3D voxelized model to bricks. We
demonstrate first-of-its-kind conversion of photographs to 3D LEGO models. An
octree architecture enables the flexibility to produce multiple resolutions to
best fit a user&#x27;s creative vision or design needs. In order to demonstrate the
broad applicability of our system, we generate step-by-step building
instructions and animations for LEGO models of objects and human faces.
Finally, we test these automatically generated LEGO sets by constructing
physical builds using real LEGO bricks.</span>

methods that have emerged recently (SimCLR, MoCo, SwAV) all make use of data
augmentations in order to construct a pretext task of instant discrimination
consisting of similar and dissimilar pairs of images. Similar pairs are
constructed by randomly extracting patches from the same image and applying
several other transformations such as color jittering or blurring, while
transformed patches from different image instances in a given batch are
regarded as dissimilar pairs. We argue that this approach can result similar
pairs that are \textit{semantically} dissimilar. In this work, we address this
problem by introducing a \textit{batch curation} scheme that selects batches
during the training process that are more inline with the underlying
contrastive objective. We provide insights into what constitutes beneficial
similar and dissimilar pairs as well as validate \textit{batch curation} on
CIFAR10 by integrating it in the SimCLR model.</span>

                                        <span>Meta-learning has been the most common framework for few-shot learning in
recent years. It learns the model from collections of few-shot classification
tasks, which is believed to have a key advantage of making the training
objective consistent with the testing objective. However, some recent works
report that by training for whole-classification, i.e. classification on the
whole label-set, it can get comparable or even better embedding than many
meta-learning algorithms. The edge between these two lines of works has yet
been underexplored, and the effectiveness of meta-learning in few-shot learning
remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a simple process: meta-learning over
a whole-classification pre-trained model on its evaluation metric. We observe
this simple method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods
on standard benchmarks. Our further analysis shed some light on understanding
the trade-offs between the meta-learning objective and the whole-classification
objective in few-shot learning.</span>

fermionic systems by using feed-forward neural networks. The anticommutation
relation for fermions is usually implemented to a variational wave function by
the Slater determinant (or Pfaffian), which is a computational bottleneck
because of the numerical cost of $O(N^3)$ for $N$ particles. We bypass this
bottleneck by explicitly calculating the sign changes associated with particle
exchanges in real space and using fully connected neural networks for
optimizing the rest parts of the wave function. This reduces the computational
cost to $O(N^2)$ or less. We show that the accuracy of the approximation can be
improved by optimizing the &quot;variance&quot; of the energy simultaneously with the
energy itself. We also find that a reweighting method in Monte Carlo sampling
can stabilize the calculation. These improvements can be applied to other
approaches based on variational Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, we show that the
accuracy can be further improved by using the symmetry of the system, the
representative states, and an additional neural network implementing a
generalized Gutzwiller-Jastrow factor. We demonstrate the efficiency of the
method by applying it to a two-dimensional Hubbard model.</span>

safety of the prior policy when it is exposed to a new task for the very first
time. This is very important for some real-world applications, including field
robots and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we develop the PEARL PLUS
(PEARL$^+$) algorithm, which optimizes the policy for both prior safety and
posterior adaptation. Building on top of PEARL, our proposed PEARL$^+$
algorithm introduces a prior regularization term in the reward function and a
new Q-network for recovering the state-action value with prior context
assumption, to improve the robustness and safety of the trained network
exposing to a new task for the first time. The performance of the PEARL$^+$
method is demonstrated by solving three safety-critical decision-making
problems related to robots and AVs, including two MuJoCo benchmark problems.
From the simulation experiments, we show that the safety of the prior policy is
significantly improved compared to that of the original PEARL method.</span>

to others in succinct forms. However, despite their predictive power, current
machine learning models are largely blackboxes, making it difficult for humans
to extract useful insights. Focusing on sequential decision-making, we design a
novel machine learning algorithm that conveys its insights to humans in the
form of interpretable &quot;tips&quot;. Our algorithm selects the tip that best bridges
the gap in performance between human users and the optimal policy. We evaluate
our approach through a series of randomized controlled user studies where
participants manage a virtual kitchen. Our experiments show that the tips
generated by our algorithm can significantly improve human performance relative
to intuitive baselines. In addition, we discuss a number of empirical insights
that can help inform the design of algorithms intended for human-AI
collaboration. For instance, we find evidence that participants do not simply
blindly follow our tips; instead, they combine them with their own experience
to discover additional strategies for improving performance.</span>

for many applications such as web advertising or healthcare. In this paper, we
address the problem of learning stochastic policies with continuous actions
from the viewpoint of counterfactual risk minimization (CRM). While the CRM
framework is appealing and well studied for discrete actions, the continuous
action case raises new challenges about modelization, optimization, and~offline
model selection with real data which turns out to be particularly challenging.
Our paper contributes to these three aspects of the CRM estimation pipeline.
First, we introduce a modelling strategy based on a joint kernel embedding of
contexts and actions, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous
discretization approaches. Second, we empirically show that the optimization
aspect of counterfactual learning is important, and we demonstrate the benefits
of proximal point algorithms and differentiable estimators. Finally, we propose
an evaluation protocol for offline policies in real-world logged systems, which
is challenging since policies cannot be replayed on test data, and we release a
new large-scale dataset along with multiple synthetic, yet realistic,
evaluation setups.</span>

verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in
particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With
linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With
non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies
such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review
existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the
Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation
strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small
multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned
attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect
outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and
demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges
(complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a
real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in
thermodynamics.</span>

vehicle (CV) concept uses real-time vehicle trajectory data to regulate green
time and has the ability to reduce intersection waiting time significantly and
thereby improve travel time in a signalized corridor. However, the CV-based
ATSC increases the size of the surface vulnerable to potential cyber-attack,
allowing an attacker to generate disastrous traffic congestion in a roadway
network. An attacker can congest a route by generating fake vehicles by
maintaining traffic and car-following rules at a slow rate so that the signal
timing and phase change without having any abrupt changes in number of
vehicles. Because of the adaptive nature of ATSC, it is a challenge to model
this kind of attack and also to develop a strategy for detection. This paper
introduces an innovative &quot;slow poisoning&quot; cyberattack for a waiting time based
ATSC algorithm and a corresponding detection strategy. Thus, the objectives of
this paper are to: (i) develop a &quot;slow poisoning&quot; attack generation strategy
for an ATSC, and (ii) develop a prediction-based &quot;slow poisoning&quot; attack
detection strategy using a recurrent neural network -- i.e., long short-term
memory model. We have generated a &quot;slow poisoning&quot; attack modeling strategy
using a microscopic traffic simulator -- Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) --
and used generated data from the simulation to develop both the attack model
and detection model. Our analyses revealed that the attack strategy is
effective in creating a congestion in an approach and detection strategy is
able to flag the attack.</span>

to the massive increase in communication platforms, social networking sites,
and greater users&#x27; participation in online public discourse. An increasing
number of people exchange private information via emails, text messages, and
social media without being aware of the risks and implications. Researchers in
the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have concentrated on creating
tools and strategies to identify, categorize, and sanitize private information
in text data since a substantial amount of data is exchanged in textual form.
However, most of the detection methods solely rely on the existence of
pre-identified keywords in the text and disregard the inference of the
underlying meaning of the utterance in a specific context. Hence, in some
situations, these tools and algorithms fail to detect disclosure, or the
produced results are miss-classified. In this paper, we propose a multi-input,
multi-output hybrid neural network which utilizes transfer-learning,
linguistics, and metadata to learn the hidden patterns. Our goal is to better
classify disclosure/non-disclosure content in terms of the context of
situation. We trained and evaluated our model on a human-annotated ground truth
dataset, containing a total of 5,400 tweets. The results show that the proposed
model was able to identify privacy disclosure through tweets with an accuracy
of 77.4% while classifying the information type of those tweets with an
impressive accuracy of 99%, by jointly learning for two separate tasks.</span>

quantum networks. An important problem, especially for near-term quantum
networks, is to develop optimal entanglement distribution protocols that take
into account the limitations of current and near-term hardware, such as quantum
memories with limited coherence time. We address this problem by initiating the
study of quantum network protocols for entanglement distribution using the
theory of decision processes, such that optimal protocols (referred to as
policies in the context of decision processes) can be found using dynamic
programming or reinforcement learning algorithms. As a first step, in this work
we focus exclusively on the elementary link level. We start by defining a
quantum decision process for elementary links, along with figures of merit for
evaluating policies. We then provide two algorithms for determining policies,
one of which we prove to be optimal (with respect to fidelity and success
probability) among all policies. Then we show that the previously-studied
memory-cutoff protocol can be phrased as a policy within our decision process
framework, allowing us to obtain several new fundamental results about it. The
conceptual developments and results of this work pave the way for the
systematic study of the fundamental limitations of near-term quantum networks,
and the requirements for physically realizing them.</span>

necessity for the navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Global Navigation
Satelite System (GNSS) provides satellite-based PNT services. However, a
spoofer can temper an authentic GNSS signal and could transmit wrong position
information to an AV. Therefore, a GNSS must have the capability of real-time
detection and feedback-correction of spoofing attacks related to PNT receivers,
whereby it will help the end-user (autonomous vehicle in this case) to navigate
safely if it falls into any compromises. This paper aims to develop a deep
reinforcement learning (RL)-based turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection using
low-cost in-vehicle sensor data. We have utilized Honda Driving Dataset to
create attack and non-attack datasets, develop a deep RL model, and evaluate
the performance of the RL-based attack detection model. We find that the
accuracy of the RL model ranges from 99.99% to 100%, and the recall value is
100%. However, the precision ranges from 93.44% to 100%, and the f1 score
ranges from 96.61% to 100%. Overall, the analyses reveal that the RL model is

                                        <span>The vulnerability of deep neural networks against adversarial examples -
inputs with small imperceptible perturbations - has gained a lot of attention
in the research community recently. Simultaneously, the number of parameters of
state-of-the-art deep learning models has been growing massively, with
implications on the memory and computational resources required to train and
deploy such models. One approach to control the size of neural networks is
retrospectively reducing the number of parameters, so-called neural network
pruning. Available research on the impact of neural network pruning on the
adversarial robustness is fragmentary and often does not adhere to established
principles of robustness evaluation. We close this gap by evaluating the
robustness of pruned models against L-0, L-2 and L-infinity attacks for a wide
range of attack strengths, several architectures, data sets, pruning methods,
and compression rates. Our results confirm that neural network pruning and
adversarial robustness are not mutually exclusive. Instead, sweet spots can be
found that are favorable in terms of model size and adversarial robustness.
Furthermore, we extend our analysis to situations that incorporate additional
assumptions on the adversarial scenario and show that depending on the

                                        <span>Policy gradient (PG) methods are popular reinforcement learning (RL) methods
where a baseline is often applied to reduce the variance of gradient estimates.
In multi-agent RL (MARL), although the PG theorem can be naturally extended,
the effectiveness of multi-agent PG (MAPG) methods degrades as the variance of
gradient estimates increases rapidly with the number of agents. In this paper,
we offer a rigorous analysis of MAPG methods by, firstly, quantifying the
contributions of the number of agents and agents&#x27; explorations to the variance
of MAPG estimators. Based on this analysis, we derive the optimal baseline (OB)
that achieves the minimal variance. In comparison to the OB, we measure the
excess variance of existing MARL algorithms such as vanilla MAPG and COMA.
Considering using deep neural networks, we also propose a surrogate version of
OB, which can be seamlessly plugged into any existing PG methods in MARL. On
benchmarks of Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraft challenges, our OB technique
effectively stabilises training and improves the performance of multi-agent PPO
and COMA algorithms by a significant margin.</span>

pretext tasks which are either (1) discriminating that explicitly specify which
features should be separated or (2) aligning that precisely indicate which
features should be closed together, but ignore the fact how to jointly and
principally define which features to be repelled and which ones to be
attracted. In this work, we combine the positive aspects of the discriminating

respectively by discriminative predictive task and concurrently maximizing
mutual information between paired views sharing redundant information. We
qualitatively and quantitatively show that our proposed model learns better

classification to semantic segmentation. Our experiments on nine established

                                        <span>The Turing mechanism describes the emergence of spatial patterns due to
spontaneous symmetry breaking in reaction-diffusion processes and underlies
many developmental processes. Identifying Turing mechanisms in biological
systems defines a challenging problem. This paper introduces an approach to the
prediction of Turing parameter values from observed Turing patterns. The
parameter values correspond to a parametrized system of reaction-diffusion
equations that generate Turing patterns as steady state. The Gierer-Meinhardt
model with four parameters is chosen as a case study. A novel invariant pattern
representation based on resistance distance histograms is employed, along with
Wasserstein kernels, in order to cope with the highly variable arrangement of
local pattern structure that depends on the initial conditions which are
assumed to be unknown. This enables to compute physically plausible distances
between patterns, to compute clusters of patterns and, above all, model
parameter prediction: for small training sets, classical state-of-the-art
methods including operator-valued kernels outperform neural networks that are
applied to raw pattern data, whereas for large training sets the latter are
more accurate. Excellent predictions are obtained for single parameter values
and reasonably accurate results for jointly predicting all parameter values.</span>

                                        <span>We present a general learning-based solution for restoring images suffering
from spatially-varying degradations. Prior approaches are typically
degradation-specific and employ the same processing across different images and
different pixels within. However, we hypothesize that such spatially rigid
processing is suboptimal for simultaneously restoring the degraded pixels as
well as reconstructing the clean regions of the image. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SPAIR, a network design that harnesses
distortion-localization information and dynamically adjusts computation to
difficult regions in the image. SPAIR comprises of two components, (1) a
localization network that identifies degraded pixels, and (2) a restoration
network that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and
feature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels. Our key
idea is to exploit the non-uniformity of heavy degradations in spatial-domain
and suitably embed this knowledge within distortion-guided modules performing
sparse normalization, feature extraction and attention. Our architecture is
agnostic to physical formation model and generalizes across several types of
spatially-varying degradations. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPAIR
individually on four restoration tasks-removal of rain-streaks, raindrops,
shadows and motion blur. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons
with prior art on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
degradation-agnostic network design offers significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art degradation-specific architectures. Code available at

near their end of life is rare. Additionally, the data produced by a machine
can only be labeled after the machine failed. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)
can incorporate the unlabeled data produced by machines that did not yet fail.
Previous work on SSL evaluated their approaches under unrealistic conditions
where the data near failure was still available. Even so, only moderate
improvements were made. This paper proposes a novel SSL approach based on
self-supervised pre-training. The method can outperform two competing
approaches from the literature and a supervised baseline under realistic

vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recent research has shown that checking the
intrinsic consistencies in the input data is a promising way to detect
adversarial attacks (e.g., by checking the object co-occurrence relationships
in complex scenes). However, existing approaches are tied to specific models
and do not offer generalizability. Motivated by the observation that language
descriptions of natural scene images have already captured the object
co-occurrence relationships that can be learned by a language model, we develop
a novel approach to perform context consistency checks using such language
models. The distinguishing aspect of our approach is that it is independent of

                                        <span>The performance of a computer vision model depends on the size and quality of
its training data. Recent studies have unveiled previously-unknown composition
biases in common image datasets which then lead to skewed model outputs, and
have proposed methods to mitigate these biases. However, most existing works
assume that human-generated annotations can be considered gold-standard and
unbiased. In this paper, we reveal that this assumption can be problematic, and
that special care should be taken to prevent models from learning such
annotation biases. We focus on facial expression recognition and compare the
label biases between lab-controlled and in-the-wild datasets. We demonstrate
that many expression datasets contain significant annotation biases between
genders, especially when it comes to the happy and angry expressions, and that
traditional methods cannot fully mitigate such biases in trained models. To
remove expression annotation bias, we propose an AU-Calibrated Facial
Expression Recognition (AUC-FER) framework that utilizes facial action units
(AUs) and incorporates the triplet loss into the objective function.
Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is more effective in
removing expression annotation bias than existing techniques.</span>

reconstruction of heat source systems (TFR-HSS) with limited monitoring
tensors, performs an essential role in heat management. However, prior methods
with common interpolations usually cannot provide accurate reconstruction. In
addition, there exists no public dataset for widely research of reconstruction
methods to further boost the field reconstruction in engineering. To overcome
this problem, this work construct a specific dataset, namely TFRD, for TFR-HSS
task with commonly used methods, including the interpolation methods and the
surrogate model based methods, as baselines to advance the research over
temperature field reconstruction. First, the TFR-HSS task is mathematically
modelled from real-world engineering problem and three types of numerically
modellings have been constructed to transform the problem into discrete mapping
forms. Besides, this work selects four typical reconstruction problem with
different heat source information and boundary conditions and generate the
standard samples as training and testing samples for further research. Finally,
a comprehensive review of the prior methods for TFR-HSS task as well as recent
widely used deep learning methods is given and we provide a performance

                                        <span>Coronary heart disease (CAD) is one of the crucial reasons for cardiovascular
mortality in middle-aged people worldwide. The most typical tool is angiography
for diagnosing CAD. The challenges of CAD diagnosis using angiography are
costly and have side effects. One of the alternative solutions is the use of
machine learning-based patterns for CAD diagnosis. Hence, this paper provides a
new hybrid machine learning model called Genetic Support Vector Machine and
Analysis of Variance (GSVMA). The ANOVA is known as the kernel function for
SVM. The proposed model is performed based on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. A
genetic optimization algorithm is used to select crucial features. In addition,
SVM with Anova, Linear SVM, and LibSVM with radial basis function methods were
applied to classify the dataset. As a result, the GSVMA hybrid method performs
better than other methods. This proposed method has the highest accuracy of
89.45% through a 10-fold cross-validation technique with 35 selected features
on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. Therefore, the genetic optimization algorithm
is very effective for improving accuracy. The computer-aided GSVMA method can
be helped clinicians with CAD diagnosis.</span>

                                        <span>Human Pose Estimation (HPE) aims at retrieving the 3D position of human
joints from images or videos. We show that current 3D HPE methods suffer a lack
of viewpoint equivariance, namely they tend to fail or perform poorly when
dealing with viewpoints unseen at training time. Deep learning methods often
rely on either scale-invariant, translation-invariant, or rotation-invariant
operations, such as max-pooling. However, the adoption of such procedures does
not necessarily improve viewpoint generalization, rather leading to more
data-dependent methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel capsule
autoencoder network with fast Variational Bayes capsule routing, named DECA. By
modeling each joint as a capsule entity, combined with the routing algorithm,
our approach can preserve the joints&#x27; hierarchical and geometrical structure in
the feature space, independently from the viewpoint. By achieving viewpoint
equivariance, we drastically reduce the network data dependency at training
time, resulting in an improved ability to generalize for unseen viewpoints. In
the experimental validation, we outperform other methods on depth images from
both seen and unseen viewpoints, both top-view, and front-view. In the RGB
domain, the same network gives state-of-the-art results on the challenging
viewpoint transfer task, also establishing a new framework for top-view HPE.

                                        <span>This paper studies a distributed multi-agent convex optimization problem. The
system comprises multiple agents in this problem, each with a set of local data
points and an associated local cost function. The agents are connected to a
server, and there is no inter-agent communication. The agents&#x27; goal is to learn
a parameter vector that optimizes the aggregate of their local costs without
revealing their local data points. In principle, the agents can solve this
problem by collaborating with the server using the traditional distributed
gradient-descent method. However, when the aggregate cost is ill-conditioned,
the gradient-descent method (i) requires a large number of iterations to
converge, and (ii) is highly unstable against process noise. We propose an
iterative pre-conditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious effects of the
cost function&#x27;s conditioning on the convergence rate of distributed
gradient-descent. Unlike the conventional pre-conditioning techniques, the
pre-conditioner matrix in our proposed technique updates iteratively to
facilitate implementation on the distributed network. In the distributed
setting, we provably show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly with
an improved rate of convergence than the traditional and adaptive
gradient-descent methods. Additionally, for the special case when the minimizer
of the aggregate cost is unique, our algorithm converges superlinearly. We
demonstrate our algorithm&#x27;s superior performance compared to prominent
distributed algorithms for solving real logistic regression problems and
emulating neural network training via a noisy quadratic model, thereby
signifying the proposed algorithm&#x27;s efficiency for distributively solving
non-convex optimization. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed
algorithm results in faster training without compromising the generalization
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Spatial-temporal prediction is a critical problem for intelligent
transportation, which is helpful for tasks such as traffic control and accident
prevention. Previous studies rely on large-scale traffic data collected from
sensors. However, it is unlikely to deploy sensors in all regions due to the
device and maintenance costs. This paper addresses the problem via outdoor
cellular traffic distilled from over two billion records per day in a telecom
company, because outdoor cellular traffic induced by user mobility is highly
related to transportation traffic. We study road intersections in urban and aim
to predict future outdoor cellular traffic of all intersections given historic
outdoor cellular traffic. Furthermore, We propose a new model for multivariate
spatial-temporal prediction, mainly consisting of two extending graph attention
networks (GAT). First GAT is used to explore correlations among multivariate
cellular traffic. Another GAT leverages the attention mechanism into graph
propagation to increase the efficiency of capturing spatial dependency.
Experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on our dataset.</span>

low-dimensional vectors, while preserving their multiple relations and
attribute information. Contrastive learning-based methods have preliminarily
shown promising performance in this task. However, most contrastive
learning-based methods mostly rely on high-quality graph embedding and explore
less on the relationships between different graph views. To deal with these
deficiencies, we design a novel node-to-node Contrastive learning framework for
Multi-view network Embedding (CREME), which mainly contains two contrastive
objectives: Multi-view fusion InfoMax and Inter-view InfoMin. The former
objective distills information from embeddings generated from different graph
views, while the latter distinguishes different graph views better to capture
the complementary information between them. Specifically, we first apply a view
encoder to generate each graph view representation and utilize a multi-view
aggregator to fuse these representations. Then, we unify the two contrastive
objectives into one learning objective for training. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets show that CREME outperforms existing methods

allows model to be trained directly at the edge without uploading data. One of
the biggest challenges faced by FL in practical applications is the
heterogeneity of edge node data, which will slow down the convergence speed and
degrade the performance of the model. For the above problems, a representative
solution is to add additional constraints in the local training, such as
FedProx, FedCurv and FedCL. However, the above algorithms still have room for

similarity annotations. The data originate from the journalistic domain in the
Czech language. We describe the process of collecting and annotating the data
in detail. The dataset contains 138,556 human annotations divided into train
and test sets. In total, 485 journalism students participated in the creation
process. To increase the reliability of the test set, we compute the annotation
as an average of 9 individual annotations. We evaluate the quality of the
dataset by measuring inter and intra annotation annotators&#x27; agreements. Beside
agreement numbers, we provide detailed statistics of the collected dataset. We
conclude our paper with a baseline experiment of building a system for
predicting the semantic similarity of sentences. Due to the massive number of
training annotations (116 956), the model can perform significantly better than
an average annotator (0,92 versus 0,86 of Person&#x27;s correlation coefficients).</span>

                                        <span>Though inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as
the desired target performance distribution is specified, it has some
significant limitations that prevent full efficiency from being achieved.
First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target
distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to
clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional
problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due
to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic
distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical
predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric
constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization
framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational
autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target
distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from
the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution
optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed
framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve
accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through
aerodynamic shape optimizations of the airfoil of a wind turbine blade, where
inverse design is actively being applied. The results of the optimizations show
that this framework is sufficiently accurate, efficient, and flexible to be
applied to other inverse design engineering applications.</span>

                                        <span>Illicit drug trafficking via social media sites such as Instagram has become
a severe problem, thus drawing a great deal of attention from law enforcement
and public health agencies. How to identify illicit drug dealers from social
media data has remained a technical challenge due to the following reasons. On
the one hand, the available data are limited because of privacy concerns with
crawling social media sites; on the other hand, the diversity of drug dealing
patterns makes it difficult to reliably distinguish drug dealers from common
drug users. Unlike existing methods that focus on posting-based detection, we
propose to tackle the problem of illicit drug dealer identification by
constructing a large-scale multimodal dataset named Identifying Drug Dealers on
Instagram (IDDIG). Totally nearly 4,000 user accounts, of which over 1,400 are
drug dealers, have been collected from Instagram with multiple data sources
including post comments, post images, homepage bio, and homepage images. We
then design a quadruple-based multimodal fusion method to combine the multiple
data sources associated with each user account for drug dealer identification.
Experimental results on the constructed IDDIG dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying drug dealers (almost 95%
accuracy). Moreover, we have developed a hashtag-based community detection
technique for discovering evolving patterns, especially those related to
geography and drug types.</span>

                                        <span>Twitch chats pose a unique problem in natural language understanding due to a
large presence of neologisms, specifically emotes. There are a total of 8.06
million emotes, over 400k of which were used in the week studied. There is
virtually no information on the meaning or sentiment of emotes, and with a
constant influx of new emotes and drift in their frequencies, it becomes
impossible to maintain an updated manually-labeled dataset. Our paper makes a
two fold contribution. First we establish a new baseline for sentiment analysis
on Twitch data, outperforming the previous supervised benchmark by 7.9% points.
Secondly, we introduce a simple but powerful unsupervised framework based on
word embeddings and k-NN to enrich existing models with out-of-vocabulary
knowledge. This framework allows us to auto-generate a pseudo-dictionary of
emotes and we show that we can nearly match the supervised benchmark above even
when injecting such emote knowledge into sentiment classifiers trained on
extraneous datasets such as movie reviews or Twitter.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks have been successful in many learning problems and
real-world applications. A recent line of research explores the power of graph
neural networks to solve combinatorial and graph algorithmic problems such as
subgraph isomorphism, detecting cliques, and the traveling salesman problem.
However, many NP-complete problems are as of yet unexplored using this method.
In this paper, we tackle the Steiner Tree Problem. We employ four learning
frameworks to compute low cost Steiner trees: feed-forward neural networks,
graph neural networks, graph convolutional networks, and a graph attention
model. We use these frameworks in two fundamentally different ways: 1) to train
the models to learn the actual Steiner tree nodes, 2) to train the model to
learn good Steiner point candidates to be connected to the constructed tree
using a shortest path in a greedy fashion. We illustrate the robustness of our
heuristics on several random graph generation models as well as the SteinLib
data library. Our finding suggests that the out-of-the-box application of GNN
methods does worse than the classic 2-approximation method. However, when
combined with a greedy shortest path construction, it even does slightly better
than the 2-approximation algorithm. This result sheds light on the fundamental
capabilities and limitations of graph learning techniques on classical
NP-complete problems.</span>

                                        <span>Anomaly detection has been a challenging task given high-dimensional
multivariate time series data generated by networked sensors and actuators in
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Besides the highly nonlinear, complex, and
dynamic natures of such time series, the lack of labeled data impedes data
exploitation in a supervised manner and thus prevents an accurate detection of
abnormal phenomenons. On the other hand, the collected data at the edge of the
network is often privacy sensitive and large in quantity, which may hinder the
centralized training at the main server. To tackle these issues, we propose an
unsupervised time series anomaly detection framework in a federated fashion to
continuously monitor the behaviors of interconnected devices within a network
and alerts for abnormal incidents so that countermeasures can be taken before
undesired consequences occur. To be specific, we leave the training data
distributed at the edge to learn a shared Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based
on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) model, which jointly captures
feature and temporal dependencies in the multivariate time series data for
representation learning and downstream anomaly detection tasks. Experiments on
three real-world networked sensor datasets illustrate the advantage of our
approach over other state-of-the-art models. We also conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection framework under
non-federated and federated settings in terms of overall performance and
detection latency.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning-based blind super-resolution (SR) methods have recently
achieved unprecedented performance in upscaling frames with unknown
degradation. These models are able to accurately estimate the unknown
downscaling kernel from a given low-resolution (LR) image in order to leverage
the kernel during restoration. Although these approaches have largely been
successful, they are predominantly image-based and therefore do not exploit the
temporal properties of the kernels across multiple video frames. In this paper,
we investigated the temporal properties of the kernels and highlighted its
importance in the task of blind video super-resolution. Specifically, we
measured the kernel temporal consistency of real-world videos and illustrated
how the estimated kernels might change per frame in videos of varying
dynamicity of the scene and its objects. With this new insight, we revisited
previous popular video SR approaches, and showed that previous assumptions of
using a fixed kernel throughout the restoration process can lead to visual
artifacts when upscaling real-world videos. In order to counteract this, we
tailored existing single-image and video SR techniques to leverage kernel
consistency during both kernel estimation and video upscaling processes.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world videos show substantial
restoration gains quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving the new
state-of-the-art in blind video SR and underlining the potential of exploiting
kernel temporal consistency.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) can protect data privacy in distributed learning
since it merely collects local gradients from users without access to their
data. However, FL is fragile in the presence of heterogeneity that is commonly
encountered in practical settings, e.g., non-IID data over different users.
Existing FL approaches usually update a single global model to capture the
shared knowledge of all users by aggregating their gradients, regardless of the
discrepancy between their data distributions. By comparison, a mixture of
multiple global models could capture the heterogeneity across various users if
assigning the users to different global models (i.e., centers) in FL. To this
end, we propose a novel multi-center aggregation mechanism . It learns multiple
global models from data, and simultaneously derives the optimal matching
between users and centers. We then formulate it as a bi-level optimization
problem that can be efficiently solved by a stochastic expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of FL show that our
method outperforms several popular FL competitors. The source code are open

there are $m$ machines, each observing $n$ samples function from an unknown
distribution on non-convex loss functions. Let $F:[-1,1]^d\to\mathbb{R}$ be the

to find an estimate of the minimizer of $F$. Based on its observations, each

bounded by $\max\big(1/\sqrt{n}(mB)^{1/d}, 1/\sqrt{mn}\big)$, up to

                                        <span>Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a classical nonlinear classifier in
statistical machine learning. Newton method with quadratic convergence rate can
solve KLR problem more effectively than the gradient method. However, an
obvious limitation of Newton method for training large-scale problems is the
$O(n^{3})$ time complexity and $O(n^{2})$ space complexity, where $n$ is the
number of training instances. In this paper, we employ the multilevel circulant
matrix (MCM) approximate kernel matrix to save in storage space and accelerate
the solution of the KLR. Combined with the characteristics of MCM and our
ingenious design, we propose an MCM approximate Newton iterative method. We
first simplify the Newton direction according to the semi-positivity of the
kernel matrix and then perform a two-step approximation of the Newton direction
by using MCM. Our method reduces the time complexity of each iteration to $O(n
\log n)$ by using the multidimensional fast Fourier transform (mFFT). In
addition, the space complexity can be reduced to $O(n)$ due to the built-in
periodicity of MCM. Experimental results on some large-scale binary and
multi-classification problems show that our method makes KLR scalable for
large-scale problems, with less memory consumption, and converges to test
accuracy without sacrifice in a shorter time.</span>

Transformer-based models to aid their interpretability in cross-lingual and
multi-lingual tasks. Prior research has found that only a few attention heads
are important in each mono-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) task and
pruning the remaining heads leads to comparable or improved performance of the
model. However, the impact of pruning attention heads is not yet clear in
cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show
that (1) pruning a number of attention heads in a multi-lingual
Transformer-based model has, in general, positive effects on its performance in
cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks and (2) the attention heads to be pruned
can be ranked using gradients and identified with a few trial experiments. Our
experiments focus on sequence labeling tasks, with potential applicability on
other cross-lingual and multi-lingual tasks. For comprehensiveness, we examine
two pre-trained multi-lingual models, namely multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) and
XLM-R, on three tasks across 9 languages each. We also discuss the validity of
our findings and their extensibility to truly resource-scarce languages and
other task settings.</span>

design/deployment of custom architectures to squeeze out maximum possible
performance and energy efficiency. Conventionally, optimizations require
iterative sampling of the design space using simulation or heuristic tools. In
this paper we investigate the possibility of learning the optimization task
using machine learning and hence using the learnt model to predict optimal
parameters for the design and mapping space of custom architectures, bypassing
any exploration step. We use three case studies involving the optimal array
design, SRAM buffer sizing, mapping, and schedule determination for
systolic-array-based custom architecture design and mapping space. Within the
purview of these case studies, we show that it is possible to capture the
design space and train a model to &quot;generalize&quot; prediction the optimal design
and mapping parameters when queried with workload and design constraints. We
perform systematic design-aware and statistical analysis of the optimization
space for our case studies and highlight the patterns in the design space. We
formulate the architecture design and mapping as a machine learning problem
that allows us to leverage existing ML models for training and inference. We
design and train a custom network architecture called AIRCHITECT, which is
capable of learning the architecture design space with as high as 94.3% test
accuracy and predicting optimal configurations which achieve on average
(GeoMean) of 99.9% the best possible performance on a test dataset with $10^5$

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student&#x27;s performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.</span>

                                        <span>Actor-critic algorithms are widely used in reinforcement learning, but are
challenging to mathematically analyze due to the online arrival of non-i.i.d.
data samples. The distribution of the data samples dynamically changes as the
model is updated, introducing a complex feedback loop between the data
distribution and the reinforcement learning algorithm. We prove that, under a
time rescaling, the online actor-critic algorithm with tabular parametrization
converges to an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as the number of updates
becomes large. The proof first establishes the geometric ergodicity of the data
samples under a fixed actor policy. Then, using a Poisson equation, we prove
that the fluctuations of the data samples around a dynamic probability measure,
which is a function of the evolving actor model, vanish as the number of
updates become large. Once the ODE limit has been derived, we study its
convergence properties using a two time-scale analysis which asymptotically
de-couples the critic ODE from the actor ODE. The convergence of the critic to
the solution of the Bellman equation and the actor to the optimal policy are
proven. In addition, a convergence rate to this global minimum is also
established. Our convergence analysis holds under specific choices for the
learning rates and exploration rates in the actor-critic algorithm, which could
provide guidance for the implementation of actor-critic algorithms in practice.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, the generalization behavior of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
is gradually transparent through explanation techniques with the frequency
components decomposition. However, the importance of the phase spectrum of the
image for a robust vision system is still ignored. In this paper, we notice
that the CNN tends to converge at the local optimum which is closely related to
the high-frequency components of the training images, while the amplitude
spectrum is easily disturbed such as noises or common corruptions. In contrast,
more empirical studies found that humans rely on more phase components to
achieve robust recognition. This observation leads to more explanations of the
CNN&#x27;s generalization behaviors in both robustness to common perturbations and
out-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data
augmentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and
the amplitude spectrum of the distracter image. That is, the generated samples
force the CNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase

several image datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performances on multiple generalizations and calibration
tasks, including adaptability for common corruptions and surface variations,
out-of-distribution detection, and adversarial attack.</span>

effective monitoring and decision making algorithms. This paper addresses the
partial observability issue of data-driven distribution modeling in order to
improve the accuracy of line parameter estimation. Inspired by the sparse
changes in residential loads, we advocate to regularize the group sparsity of
the unobservable injections in a bi-linear estimation problem. The alternating
minimization scheme of guaranteed convergence is proposed to take advantage of
convex subproblems with efficient solutions. Numerical results using real-world
load data on the single-phase equivalent of the IEEE 123-bus test case have
demonstrated the accuracy improvements of the proposed solution over existing
work for both parameter estimation and voltage modeling.</span>

interconnectivity of the world&#x27;s Internet infrastructures, a machine learning
based intrusion detection system (IDS) has become a vital component to protect
our economic and national security. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive
study on NSL-KDD, a network traffic dataset, by visualizing patterns and
employing different learning-based models to detect cyber attacks. Unlike
previous shallow learning and deep learning models that use the single learning
model approach for intrusion detection, we adopt a hierarchy strategy, in which
the intrusion and normal behavior are classified firstly, and then the specific
types of attacks are classified. We demonstrate the advantage of the
unsupervised representation learning model in binary intrusion detection tasks.
Besides, we alleviate the data imbalance problem with SVM-SMOTE oversampling
technique in 4-class classification and further demonstrate the effectiveness
and the drawback of the oversampling mechanism with a deep neural network as a
base model.</span>

still be integrated into such networks by applying a line graph transformation.
We also propose a method for neighborhood sampling based on a topological
neighborhood composed of both local and global neighbors. We compare the

                                        <span>We prove novel algorithmic guarantees for several online problems in the
smoothed analysis model. In this model, at each time an adversary chooses an
input distribution with density function bounded above by $\tfrac{1}{\sigma}$
times that of the uniform distribution; nature then samples an input from this
distribution. Crucially, our results hold for {\em adaptive} adversaries that
can choose an input distribution based on the decisions of the algorithm and
the realizations of the inputs in the previous time steps.

This paper presents a general technique for proving smoothed algorithmic
guarantees against adaptive adversaries, in effect reducing the setting of
adaptive adversaries to the simpler case of oblivious adversaries. We apply
this technique to prove strong smoothed guarantees for three problems:

-Online learning: We consider the online prediction problem, where instances
are generated from an adaptive sequence of $\sigma$-smooth distributions and
the hypothesis class has VC dimension $d$. We bound the regret by
$\tilde{O}\big(\sqrt{T d\ln(1/\sigma)} + d\sqrt{\ln(T/\sigma)}\big)$. This
answers open questions of [RST11,Hag18].

-Online discrepancy minimization: We consider the online Koml\&#x27;os problem,
where the input is generated from an adaptive sequence of $\sigma$-smooth and
isotropic distributions on the $\ell_2$ unit ball. We bound the $\ell_\infty$
norm of the discrepancy vector by $\tilde{O}\big(\ln^2\!\big(
\frac{nT}{\sigma}\big) \big)$.

-Dispersion in online optimization: We consider online optimization of
piecewise Lipschitz functions where functions with $\ell$ discontinuities are
chosen by a smoothed adaptive adversary and show that the resulting sequence is
$\big( {\sigma}/{\sqrt{T\ell}}, \tilde O\big(\sqrt{T\ell}
\big)\big)$-dispersed. This matches the parameters of [BDV18] for oblivious
adversaries, up to log factors.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of PAC learning halfspaces on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with
Massart noise under Gaussian marginals. In the Massart noise model, an
adversary is allowed to flip the label of each point $\mathbf{x}$ with
probability $\eta(\mathbf{x}) \leq \eta$, for some parameter $\eta \in
[0,1/2]$.

The goal of the learner is to output a hypothesis with missclassification
error $\mathrm{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathrm{opt}$ is the error of the
target halfspace. Prior work studied this problem assuming that the target
halfspace is homogeneous and that the parameter $\eta$ is strictly smaller than
$1/2$. We explore how the complexity of the problem changes when either of
these assumptions is removed, establishing the following threshold phenomena:

For $\eta &#x3D; 1/2$, we prove a lower bound of $d^{\Omega (\log(1/\epsilon))}$
on the complexity of any Statistical Query (SQ) algorithm for the problem,
which holds even for homogeneous halfspaces. On the positive side, we give a
new learning algorithm for arbitrary halfspaces in this regime with sample
complexity and running time $O_\epsilon(1) \, d^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$.

For $\eta &lt;1/2$, we establish a lower bound of $d^{\Omega(\log(1/\gamma))}$
on the SQ complexity of the problem, where $\gamma &#x3D; \max\{\epsilon,
\min\{\mathbf{Pr}[f(\mathbf{x}) &#x3D; 1], \mathbf{Pr}[f(\mathbf{x}) &#x3D; -1]\} \}$ and
$f$ is the target halfspace. In particular, this implies an SQ lower bound of
$d^{\Omega (\log(1/\epsilon) )}$ for learning arbitrary Massart halfspaces
(even for small constant $\eta$). We complement this lower bound with a new
learning algorithm for this regime with sample complexity and runtime
$d^{O_{\eta}(\log(1/\gamma))} \mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$.

Taken together, our results qualitatively characterize the complexity of
learning halfspaces in the Massart model.</span>

learning mappings between finite dimensional Euclidean spaces or finite sets.
We propose a generalization of neural networks tailored to learn operators
mapping between infinite dimensional function spaces. We formulate the
approximation of operators by composition of a class of linear integral
operators and nonlinear activation functions, so that the composed operator can
approximate complex nonlinear operators. Furthermore, we introduce four classes
of operator parameterizations: graph-based operators, low-rank operators,
multipole graph-based operators, and Fourier operators and describe efficient
algorithms for computing with each one. The proposed neural operators are
resolution-invariant: they share the same network parameters between different
discretizations of the underlying function spaces and can be used for zero-shot
super-resolutions. Numerically, the proposed models show superior performance
compared to existing machine learning based methodologies on Burgers&#x27; equation,
Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation, while being several order of
magnitude faster compared to conventional PDE solvers.</span>

often correlate poorly with human judgements. Newer metrics such as BERTScore
have addressed many weaknesses in prior metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, which
rely on n-gram matching. These newer methods, however, are still limited in
that they do not consider the generation context, so they cannot properly
reward generated text that is correct but deviates from the given reference.

In this paper, we propose Language Model Augmented Relevance Score (MARS), a
new context-aware metric for NLG evaluation. MARS leverages off-the-shelf
language models, guided by reinforcement learning, to create augmented
references that consider both the generation context and available human
references, which are then used as additional references to score generated
text. Compared with seven existing metrics in three common NLG tasks, MARS not
only achieves higher correlation with human reference judgements, but also
differentiates well-formed candidates from adversarial samples to a larger
degree.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) has gain growing interests for its capability of
learning from distributed data sources collectively without the need of
accessing the raw data samples across different sources. So far FL research has
mostly focused on improving the performance, how the algorithmic disparity will
be impacted for the model learned from FL and the impact of algorithmic
disparity on the utility inconsistency are largely unexplored. In this paper,
we propose an FL framework to jointly consider performance consistency and
algorithmic fairness across different local clients (data sources). We derive
our framework from a constrained multi-objective optimization perspective, in
which we learn a model satisfying fairness constraints on all clients with
consistent performance. Specifically, we treat the algorithm prediction loss at
each local client as an objective and maximize the worst-performing client with
fairness constraints through optimizing a surrogate maximum function with all
objectives involved. A gradient-based procedure is employed to achieve the
Pareto optimality of this optimization problem. Theoretical analysis is
provided to prove that our method can converge to a Pareto solution that
achieves the min-max performance with fairness constraints on all clients.
Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority that our approach over baselines and its effectiveness in achieving
both fairness and consistency across all local clients.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning has been successfully applied to pre-train video
representations, which aims at efficient adaptation from pre-training domain to
downstream tasks. Existing approaches merely leverage contrastive loss to learn
instance-level discrimination. However, lack of category information will lead
to hard-positive problem that constrains the generalization ability of this
kind of methods. We find that the multi-task process of meta learning can
provide a solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a
Meta-Contrastive Network (MCN), which combines the contrastive learning and
meta learning, to enhance the learning ability of existing self-supervised
approaches. Our method contains two training stages based on model-agnostic
meta learning (MAML), each of which consists of a contrastive branch and a meta
branch. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For
two downstream tasks, i.e., video action recognition and video retrieval, MCN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. To be
more specific, with R(2+1)D backbone, MCN achieves Top-1 accuracies of 84.8%
and 54.5% for video action recognition, as well as 52.5% and 23.7% for video
retrieval.</span>

                                        <span>With the popularity of blockchain technology, the financial security issues
of blockchain transaction networks have become increasingly serious. Phishing
scam detection methods will protect possible victims and build a healthier
blockchain ecosystem. Usually, the existing works define phishing scam
detection as a node classification task by learning the potential features of
users through graph embedding methods such as random walk or graph neural
network (GNN). However, these detection methods are suffered from high
complexity due to the large scale of the blockchain transaction network,
ignoring temporal information of the transaction. Addressing this problem, we
defined the transaction pattern graphs for users and transformed the phishing
scam detection into a graph classification task. To extract richer information
from the input graph, we proposed a multi-channel graph classification model
(MCGC) with multiple feature extraction channels for GNN. The transaction
pattern graphs and MCGC are more able to detect potential phishing scammers by
extracting the transaction pattern features of the target users. Extensive
experiments on seven benchmark and Ethereum datasets demonstrate that the
proposed MCGC can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance in the graph
classification task but also achieve effective phishing scam detection based on
the target users&#x27; transaction pattern graphs.</span>

                                        <span>Virtual Reality (VR) games that feature physical activities have been shown
to increase players&#x27; motivation to do physical exercise. However, for such
exercises to have a positive healthcare effect, they have to be repeated
several times a week. To maintain player motivation over longer periods of
time, games often employ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to adapt the
game&#x27;s challenge according to the player&#x27;s capabilities. For exercise games,
this is mostly done by tuning specific in-game parameters like the speed of
objects. In this work, we propose to use experience-driven Procedural Content
Generation for DDA in VR exercise games by procedurally generating levels that
match the player&#x27;s current capabilities. Not only finetuning specific
parameters but creating completely new levels has the potential to decrease
repetition over longer time periods and allows for the simultaneous adaptation
of the cognitive and physical challenge of the exergame. As a proof-of-concept,
we implement an initial prototype in which the player must traverse a maze that
includes several exercise rooms, whereby the generation of the maze is realized
by a neural network. Passing those exercise rooms requires the player to
perform physical activities. To match the player&#x27;s capabilities, we use Deep
Reinforcement Learning to adjust the structure of the maze and to decide which
exercise rooms to include in the maze. We evaluate our prototype in an
exploratory user study utilizing both biodata and subjective questionnaires.</span>

fundamental performance bottleneck for state of the art skeleton action
recognition models. Despite this bottleneck, community&#x27;s efforts seem to be
invested only in coming up with novel architectures. To specifically address
this bottleneck, we introduce two new pose based human action datasets -
NTU60-X and NTU120-X. Our datasets extend the largest existing action
recognition dataset, NTU-RGBD. In addition to the 25 body joints for each
skeleton as in NTU-RGBD, NTU60-X and NTU120-X dataset includes finger and
facial joints, enabling a richer skeleton representation. We appropriately
modify the state of the art approaches to enable training using the introduced

overcoming the aforementioned bottleneck and improve state of the art

in count distribution and exhibit discontinuities across the count range. As a
result, the de facto statistical measures (MSE, MAE) exhibit large variance and
tend to be unreliable indicators of performance across the count range. To
address these concerns in a holistic manner, we revise processes at various
stages of the standard crowd counting pipeline. To enable principled and
balanced minibatch sampling, we propose a novel smoothed Bayesian sample
stratification approach. We propose a novel cost function which can be readily
incorporated into existing crowd counting deep networks to encourage
strata-aware optimization. We analyze the performance of representative crowd

standard datasets and demonstrate that our proposed modifications noticeably

paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the

spatio-temporal relationship between humans and objects are the important cue
to understand the contextual information presented in the video. With the
effective spatio-temporal relationship modeling, it is possible not only to
uncover contextual information in each frame but also to directly capture
inter-time dependencies. It is more critical to capture the position changes of
human and objects over the spatio-temporal dimension when their appearance
features may not show up significant changes over time. The full use of
appearance features, the spatial location and the semantic information are also
the key to improve the video-based Human-Object Interaction recognition
performance. In this paper, Spatio-Temporal Interaction Graph Parsing Networks
(STIGPN) are constructed, which encode the videos with a graph composed of
human and object nodes. These nodes are connected by two types of relations:
(i) spatial relations modeling the interactions between human and the
interacted objects within each frame. (ii) inter-time relations capturing the
long range dependencies between human and the interacted objects across frame.
With the graph, STIGPN learn spatio-temporal features directly from the whole
video-based Human-Object Interaction scenes. Multi-modal features and a
multi-stream fusion strategy are used to enhance the reasoning capability of
STIGPN. Two Human-Object Interaction video datasets, including CAD-120 and
Something-Else, are used to evaluate the proposed architectures, and the
state-of-the-art performance demonstrates the superiority of STIGPN.</span>

network (RP-Net) and a feature-aided loop filter (LF-Net). For the RP-Net, we
exploit the residual of previous multiple frames to further eliminate the
redundancy of the current frame residual. For the LF-Net, the features from
residual decoding network and the motion compensation network are used to aid
the reconstruction quality. To reduce the complexity, a light ResNet structure
is used as the backbone for both RP-Net and LF-Net. Experimental results
illustrate that we can save about 10% BD-rate compared with previous learned
video compression frameworks. Moreover, we can achieve faster coding speed due
to the ResNet backbone. This project is available at

                                        <span>The performance of a computer vision model depends on the size and quality of
its training data. Recent studies have unveiled previously-unknown composition
biases in common image datasets which then lead to skewed model outputs, and
have proposed methods to mitigate these biases. However, most existing works
assume that human-generated annotations can be considered gold-standard and
unbiased. In this paper, we reveal that this assumption can be problematic, and
that special care should be taken to prevent models from learning such
annotation biases. We focus on facial expression recognition and compare the
label biases between lab-controlled and in-the-wild datasets. We demonstrate
that many expression datasets contain significant annotation biases between
genders, especially when it comes to the happy and angry expressions, and that
traditional methods cannot fully mitigate such biases in trained models. To
remove expression annotation bias, we propose an AU-Calibrated Facial
Expression Recognition (AUC-FER) framework that utilizes facial action units
(AUs) and incorporates the triplet loss into the objective function.
Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is more effective in
removing expression annotation bias than existing techniques.</span>

allows model to be trained directly at the edge without uploading data. One of
the biggest challenges faced by FL in practical applications is the
heterogeneity of edge node data, which will slow down the convergence speed and
degrade the performance of the model. For the above problems, a representative
solution is to add additional constraints in the local training, such as
FedProx, FedCurv and FedCL. However, the above algorithms still have room for
improvement. We propose to use the aggregation of all models obtained in the

documents, which often require additional information outside the table. To
this end, we propose a method of retrieving relevant sentences from the paper
body, and feeding the table content as well as the retrieved sentences into
pre-trained language models (e.g. T5 and GPT-2) for generating table captions.
The contributions of this paper are: (1) discussion on the challenges in table
captioning for scholarly documents; (2) development of a dataset DocBank-TB,
which is publicly available; and (3) comparison of caption generation methods
for scholarly documents with different strategies to retrieve relevant
sentences from the paper body. Our experimental results showed that T5 is the
better generation model for this task, as it outperformed GPT-2 in BLEU and
METEOR implying that the generated text are clearer and more precise. Moreover,
inputting relevant sentences matching the row header or whole table is
effective.</span>

share a similar goal: to design a rule-fact network that allows a computer to

phishing website detection study uses a MLES to detect potential phishing
websites by analyzing site properties (like URL length and expiration time).
The fake news detection study uses a MLES rule-fact network to gauge news story
truthfulness based on factors such as emotion, the speaker&#x27;s political
affiliation status, and job. The two studies use different MLES network
implementations, which are presented and compared herein. The fake news study
utilized a more linear design while the phishing project utilized a more

understanding (NLU) tasks, there is a gap between these pretrained encoders and
natural language generation (NLG). NLG tasks are often based on the
encoder-decoder framework, where the pretrained encoders can only benefit part
of it. To reduce this gap, we introduce DeltaLM, a pretrained multilingual
encoder-decoder model that regards the decoder as the task layer of
off-the-shelf pretrained encoders. Specifically, we augment the pretrained
multilingual encoder with a decoder and pre-train it in a self-supervised way.
To take advantage of both the large-scale monolingual data and bilingual data,
we adopt the span corruption and translation span corruption as the
pre-training tasks. Experiments show that DeltaLM outperforms various strong
baselines on both natural language generation and translation tasks, including
machine translation, abstractive text summarization, data-to-text, and question
generation. The code and pretrained models are available at

which is of great commercial potential. Considering the customer preferences on
different product aspects, it would benefit from generating aspect-oriented
customized summaries. However, conventional systems typically focus on
providing general product summaries, which may miss the opportunity to match
products with customer interests. To address the problem, we propose CUSTOM,
aspect-oriented product summarization for e-commerce, which generates diverse
and controllable summaries towards different product aspects. To support the
study of CUSTOM and further this line of research, we construct two Chinese
datasets, i.e., SMARTPHONE and COMPUTER, including 76,279 / 49,280 short
summaries for 12,118 / 11,497 real-world commercial products, respectively.
Furthermore, we introduce EXT, an extraction-enhanced generation framework for
CUSTOM, where two famous sequence-to-sequence models are implemented in this
paper. We conduct extensive experiments on the two proposed datasets for CUSTOM
and show results of two famous baseline models and EXT, which indicates that
EXT can generate diverse, high-quality, and consistent summaries.</span>

                                        <span>We propose UniT, a Unified Transformer model to simultaneously learn the most
prominent tasks across different domains, ranging from object detection to
natural language understanding and multimodal reasoning. Based on the
transformer encoder-decoder architecture, our UniT model encodes each input
modality with an encoder and makes predictions on each task with a shared
decoder over the encoded input representations, followed by task-specific
output heads. The entire model is jointly trained end-to-end with losses from
each task. Compared to previous efforts on multi-task learning with
transformers, we share the same model parameters across all tasks instead of
separately fine-tuning task-specific models and handle a much higher variety of
tasks across different domains. In our experiments, we learn 7 tasks jointly
over 8 datasets, achieving strong performance on each task with significantly
fewer parameters. Our code is available in MMF at https://mmf.sh.</span>

                                        <span>The open-access dissemination of pretrained language models through online
repositories has led to a democratization of state-of-the-art natural language
processing (NLP) research. This also allows people outside of NLP to use such
models and adapt them to specific use-cases. However, a certain amount of
technical proficiency is still required which is an entry barrier for users who
want to apply these models to a certain task but lack the necessary knowledge
or resources. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by providing a tool
which allows researchers to leverage pretrained models without writing a single
line of code. Built upon the parameter-efficient adapter modules for transfer
learning, our AdapterHub Playground provides an intuitive interface, allowing
the usage of adapters for prediction, training and analysis of textual data for
a variety of NLP tasks. We present the tool&#x27;s architecture and demonstrate its
advantages with prototypical use-cases, where we show that predictive
performance can easily be increased in a few-shot learning scenario. Finally,
we evaluate its usability in a user study. We provide the code and a live

                                        <span>Recently, there has been an increasing number of efforts to introduce models
capable of generating natural language explanations (NLEs) for their
predictions on vision-language (VL) tasks. Such models are appealing, because
they can provide human-friendly and comprehensive explanations. However, there
is a lack of comparison between existing methods, which is due to a lack of
re-usable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. In this work, we
introduce e-ViL and e-SNLI-VE. e-ViL is a benchmark for explainable
vision-language tasks that establishes a unified evaluation framework and
provides the first comprehensive comparison of existing approaches that
generate NLEs for VL tasks. It spans four models and three datasets and both
automatic metrics and human evaluation are used to assess model-generated
explanations. e-SNLI-VE is currently the largest existing VL dataset with NLEs
(over 430k instances). We also propose a new model that combines UNITER, which
learns joint embeddings of images and text, and GPT-2, a pre-trained language
model that is well-suited for text generation. It surpasses the previous state
of the art by a large margin across all datasets. Code and data are available

                                        <span>The number of biomedical literature on new biomedical concepts is rapidly
increasing, which necessitates a reliable biomedical named entity recognition
(BioNER) model for identifying new and unseen entity mentions. However, it is
questionable whether existing BioNER models can effectively handle them. In
this work, we systematically analyze the three types of recognition abilities
of BioNER models: memorization, synonym generalization, and concept
generalization. We find that although BioNER models achieve state-of-the-art
performance on BioNER benchmarks based on overall performance, they have
limitations in identifying synonyms and new biomedical concepts such as
COVID-19. From this observation, we conclude that existing BioNER models are
overestimated in terms of their generalization abilities. Also, we identify
several difficulties in recognizing unseen mentions in BioNER and make the
following conclusions: (1) BioNER models tend to exploit dataset biases, which
hinders the models&#x27; abilities to generalize, and (2) several biomedical names
have novel morphological patterns with little name regularity such as COVID-19,
and models fail to recognize them. We apply a current statistics-based
debiasing method to our problem as a simple remedy and show the improvement in
generalization to unseen mentions. We hope that our analyses and findings would
be able to facilitate further research into the generalization capabilities of
NER models in a domain where their reliability is of utmost importance.</span>

                                        <span>Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest
X-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
Since manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent
auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and
immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the
COVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the
detected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize
the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning
strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the
knowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize
the acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through
observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report
generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical
findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital
of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of
the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale
Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for
further fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT
achieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report
generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset. The
Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset is available at https://covid19ct.github.io/.</span>

that achieve state-of-the-art performance rarely solve the problem by paying
enough emphasis on the modeling of evidence, missing the opportunity to further
improve the model&#x27;s reasoning ability for R-MRC. To alleviate the above issue,
in this paper, we propose an evidence-emphasized discrete reasoning approach
(EviDR), in which sentence and clause level evidence is first detected based on
distant supervision, and then used to drive a reasoning module implemented with
a relational heterogeneous graph convolutional network to derive answers.
Extensive experiments are conducted on DROP (discrete reasoning over
paragraphs) dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. In addition, qualitative analysis verifies the capability of
the proposed evidence-emphasized discrete reasoning for R-MRC.</span>

when applied to the long-text generation scenarios such as story generation or
advertising text generation in the commercial scenario, these methods may
generate illogical and uncontrollable texts. To address these aforementioned
issues, we propose a graph-based grouping planner(GGP) following the idea of
first-plan-then-generate. Specifically, given a collection of key phrases, GGP
firstly encodes these phrases into an instance-level sequential representation
and a corpus-level graph-based representation separately. With these two
synergic representations, we then regroup these phrases into a fine-grained
plan, based on which we generate the final long text. We conduct our
experiments on three long text generation datasets and the experimental results
reveal that GGP significantly outperforms baselines, which proves that GGP can
control the long text generation by knowing how to say and in what order.</span>

                                        <span>Quantum computing has been a fascinating research field in quantum physics.
Recent progresses motivate us to study in depth the universal quantum computing
models (UQCM), which lie at the foundation of quantum computing and have tight
connections with fundamental physics. Although being developed decades ago, a
physically concise principle or picture to formalize and understand UQCM is
still lacking. This is challenging given the diversity of still-emerging
models, but important to understand the difference between classical and
quantum computing. In this work, we carried out a primary attempt to unify UQCM
by classifying a few of them as two categories, hence making a table of models.
With such a table, some known models or schemes appear as hybridization or
combination of models, and more importantly, it leads to new schemes that have
not been explored yet. Our study of UQCM also leads to some insights into
quantum algorithms. This work reveals the importance and feasibility of
systematic study of computing models.</span>

                                        <span>Sequence-to-sequence models provide a viable new approach to generative
summarization, allowing models that are no longer limited to simply selecting
and recombining sentences from the original text. However, these models have
three drawbacks: their grasp of the details of the original text is often
inaccurate, and the text generated by such models often has repetitions, while
it is difficult to handle words that are beyond the word list. In this paper,
we propose a new architecture that combines reinforcement learning and
adversarial generative networks to enhance the sequence-to-sequence attention
model. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that copies words
directly from the source text, contributing to accurate reproduction of
information without sacrificing the ability of generators to generate new
words. Second, we use both intra-temporal and intra-decoder attention to
penalize summarized content and thus discourage repetition. We apply our model
to our own proposed COVID-19 paper title summarization task and achieve close
approximations to the current model on ROUEG, while bringing better
readability.</span>

particularly challenging for small businesses with limited advertising
experience. When an inexperienced advertiser onboards with a poorly written ad
text, the ad platform has the opportunity to detect low performing ad text, and
provide improvement suggestions. To realize this opportunity, we propose an ad
text strength indicator (TSI) which: (i) predicts the click-through-rate (CTR)
for an input ad text, (ii) fetches similar existing ads to create a
neighborhood around the input ad, (iii) and compares the predicted CTRs in the
neighborhood to declare whether the input ad is strong or weak. In addition, as
suggestions for ad text improvement, TSI shows anonymized versions of superior
ads (higher predicted CTR) in the neighborhood. For (i), we propose a BERT
based text-to-CTR model trained on impressions and clicks associated with an ad
text. For (ii), we propose a sentence-BERT based semantic-ad-similarity model
trained using weak labels from ad campaign setup data. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our BERT based text-to-CTR model achieves a significant lift
in CTR prediction AUC for cold start (new) advertisers compared to bag-of-words
based baselines. In addition, our semantic-textual-similarity model for similar
ads retrieval achieves a precision@1 of 0.93 (for retrieving ads from the same
product category); this is significantly higher compared to unsupervised
TF-IDF, word2vec, and sentence-BERT baselines. Finally, we share promising
online results from advertisers in the Yahoo (Verizon Media) ad platform where
a variant of TSI was implemented with sub-second end-to-end latency.</span>

to address latency challenges? (3) How to ensure model robustness? This work
builds on existing efforts of LinkedIn search, and is tested at scale on a

scale transformer models. Although they achieve state of the art on many
important language tasks, transformers often require expensive compute
resources, and days spanning to weeks to train. This is feasible for
researchers at big tech companies and leading research universities, but not
for scrappy start-up founders, students, and independent researchers. Stephen
Merity&#x27;s SHA-RNN, a compact, hybrid attention-RNN model, is designed for
consumer-grade modeling as it requires significantly fewer parameters and less
training time to reach near state of the art results. We analyze Merity&#x27;s model
here through an exploratory model analysis over several units of the
architecture considering both training time and overall quality in our
assessment. Ultimately, we combine these findings into a new architecture which
we call SHAQ: Single Headed Attention Quasi-recurrent Neural Network. With our
new architecture we achieved similar accuracy results as the SHA-RNN while

                                        <span>Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks in natural language
understanding (NLU) for identifying users&#x27; needs from their utterances. These
two tasks are highly related and often trained jointly. However, most previous
works assume that each utterance only corresponds to one intent, ignoring the
fact that a user utterance in many cases could include multiple intents. In
this paper, we propose a novel Self-Distillation Joint NLU model (SDJN) for
multi-intent NLU. First, we formulate multiple intent detection as a weakly
supervised problem and approach with multiple instance learning (MIL). Then, we
design an auxiliary loop via self-distillation with three orderly arranged
decoders: Initial Slot Decoder, MIL Intent Decoder, and Final Slot Decoder. The
output of each decoder will serve as auxiliary information for the next
decoder. With the auxiliary knowledge provided by the MIL Intent Decoder, we
set Final Slot Decoder as the teacher model that imparts knowledge back to
Initial Slot Decoder to complete the loop. The auxiliary loop enables intents
and slots to guide mutually in-depth and further boost the overall NLU
performance. Experimental results on two public multi-intent datasets indicate
that our model achieves strong performance compared to others.</span>

Extractor&#x27; \footnote{https://abera87.github.io/annotate/} (RTE) for annotating
relation triplets from the text. Relation extraction is an important task for
extracting structured information about real-world entities from the
unstructured text available on the Web. In relation extraction, we focus on
binary relation that refers to relations between two entities. Recently, many
supervised models are proposed to solve this task, but they mostly use noisy
training data obtained using the distant supervision method. In many cases,
evaluation of the models is also done based on a noisy test dataset. The lack
of annotated clean dataset is a key challenge in this area of research. In this
work, we built a web-based tool where researchers can annotate datasets for
relation extraction on their own very easily. We use a server-less architecture
for this tool, and the entire annotation operation is processed using
client-side code. Thus it does not suffer from any network latency, and the
privacy of the user&#x27;s data is also maintained. We hope that this tool will be
beneficial for the researchers to advance the field of relation extraction.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise and development of deep learning over the past decade, there
has been a steady momentum of innovation and breakthroughs that convincingly
push the state-of-the-art of cross-modal analytics between vision and language
in multimedia field. Nevertheless, there has not been an open-source codebase
in support of training and deploying numerous neural network models for
cross-modal analytics in a unified and modular fashion. In this work, we
propose X-modaler -- a versatile and high-performance codebase that
encapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several
general-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,
decoder, and decode strategy). Each stage is empowered with the functionality
that covers a series of modules widely adopted in state-of-the-arts and allows
seamless switching in between. This way naturally enables a flexible
implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video
captioning, and vision-language pre-training, aiming to facilitate the rapid
development of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular
designs in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across
different vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power
startup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual
question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.
X-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects
and pre-trained models are available on-line:

                                        <span>In this paper, we explore the problem of developing personalized chatbots. A
personalized chatbot is designed as a digital chatting assistant for a user.
The key characteristic of a personalized chatbot is that it should have a
consistent personality with the corresponding user. It can talk the same way as
the user when it is delegated to respond to others&#x27; messages. We present a
retrieval-based personalized chatbot model, namely IMPChat, to learn an
implicit user profile from the user&#x27;s dialogue history. We argue that the
implicit user profile is superior to the explicit user profile regarding
accessibility and flexibility. IMPChat aims to learn an implicit user profile
through modeling user&#x27;s personalized language style and personalized
preferences separately. To learn a user&#x27;s personalized language style, we
elaborately build language models from shallow to deep using the user&#x27;s
historical responses; To model a user&#x27;s personalized preferences, we explore
the conditional relations underneath each post-response pair of the user. The
personalized preferences are dynamic and context-aware: we assign higher
weights to those historical pairs that are topically related to the current
query when aggregating the personalized preferences. We match each response
candidate with the personalized language style and personalized preference,
respectively, and fuse the two matching signals to determine the final ranking
score. Comprehensive experiments on two large datasets show that our method
outperforms all baseline models.</span>

and development of reliable, valid, robust, and practical solutions for
automatically detecting descriptions of socio-political events, such as
protests, riots, wars and armed conflicts, in text streams. This year workshop
contributors make use of the state-of-the-art NLP technologies, such as Deep
Learning, Word Embeddings and Transformers and cover a wide range of topics
from text classification to news bias detection. Around 40 teams have
registered and 15 teams contributed to three tasks that are i) multilingual
protest news detection, ii) fine-grained classification of socio-political
events, and iii) discovering Black Lives Matter protest events. The workshop
also highlights two keynote and four invited talks about various aspects of
creating event data sets and multi- and cross-lingual machine learning in few-

target style. Despite there being a number of style tasks with available data,
there has been limited systematic discussion of how text style datasets relate
to each other. This understanding, however, is likely to have implications for
selecting multiple data sources for model training. While it is prudent to
consider inherent stylistic properties when determining these relationships, we
also must consider how a style is realized in a particular dataset. In this

                                        <span>Programming microcontrollers involves low-level interfacing with hardware and
peripherals that are concurrent and reactive. Such programs are typically
written in a mixture of C and assembly using concurrent language extensions
(like $\texttt{FreeRTOS tasks}$ and $\texttt{semaphores}$), resulting in
unsafe, callback-driven, error-prone and difficult-to-maintain code.

We address this challenge by introducing $\texttt{SenseVM}$ - a
bytecode-interpreted virtual machine that provides a message-passing based
$\textit{higher-order concurrency}$ model, originally introduced by Reppy, for
microcontroller programming. This model treats synchronous operations as
first-class values (called $\texttt{Events}$) akin to the treatment of
first-class functions in functional languages. This primarily allows the
programmer to compose and tailor their own concurrency abstractions and,
additionally, abstracts away unsafe memory operations, common in shared-memory
concurrency models, thereby making microcontroller programs safer, composable
and easier-to-maintain.

Our VM is made portable via a low-level $\textit{bridge}$ interface, built
atop the embedded OS - Zephyr. The bridge is implemented by all drivers and
designed such that programming in response to a software message or a hardware
interrupt remains uniform and indistinguishable. In this paper we demonstrate
the features of our VM through an example, written in a Caml-like functional
language, running on the $\texttt{nRF52840}$ and $\texttt{STM32F4}$
microcontrollers.</span>

in addition to performing knowledge distillation. First, we revisit the search
space of generative models, introducing an inception-based residual block into
generators. Second, to achieve target computation cost, we propose a one-step
pruning algorithm that searches a student architecture from the teacher model
and substantially reduces searching cost. It requires no l1 sparsity
regularization and its associated hyper-parameters, simplifying the training
procedure. Finally, we propose to distill knowledge through maximizing feature
similarity between teacher and student via an index named Global Kernel
Alignment (GKA). Our compressed networks achieve similar or even better image
fidelity (FID, mIoU) than the original models with much-reduced computational
cost, e.g., MACs. Code will be released at

                                        <span>Recently, there has been an increasing number of efforts to introduce models
capable of generating natural language explanations (NLEs) for their
predictions on vision-language (VL) tasks. Such models are appealing, because
they can provide human-friendly and comprehensive explanations. However, there
is a lack of comparison between existing methods, which is due to a lack of
re-usable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. In this work, we
introduce e-ViL and e-SNLI-VE. e-ViL is a benchmark for explainable
vision-language tasks that establishes a unified evaluation framework and
provides the first comprehensive comparison of existing approaches that
generate NLEs for VL tasks. It spans four models and three datasets and both
automatic metrics and human evaluation are used to assess model-generated
explanations. e-SNLI-VE is currently the largest existing VL dataset with NLEs
(over 430k instances). We also propose a new model that combines UNITER, which
learns joint embeddings of images and text, and GPT-2, a pre-trained language
model that is well-suited for text generation. It surpasses the previous state
of the art by a large margin across all datasets. Code and data are available
here: https://github.com/maximek3/e-ViL.</span>

                                        <span>3D ultrasound (US) is widely used for its rich diagnostic information.
However, it is criticized for its limited field of view. 3D freehand US
reconstruction is promising in addressing the problem by providing broad range
and freeform scan. The existing deep learning based methods only focus on the
basic cases of skill sequences, and the model relies on the training data
heavily. The sequences in real clinical practice are a mix of diverse skills
and have complex scanning paths. Besides, deep models should adapt themselves
to the testing cases with prior knowledge for better robustness, rather than
only fit to the training cases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
sensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction considering the complex skill
sequences. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a novel online
learning framework by designing a differentiable reconstruction algorithm. It
realizes an end-to-end optimization from section sequences to the reconstructed
volume. Second, a self-supervised learning method is developed to explore the
context information that reconstructed by the testing data itself, promoting
the perception of the model. Third, inspired by the effectiveness of shape
prior, we also introduce adversarial training to strengthen the learning of
anatomical shape prior in the reconstructed volume. By mining the context and
structural cues of the testing data, our online learning methods can drive the
model to handle complex skill sequences. Experimental results on developmental
dysplasia of the hip US and fetal US datasets show that, our proposed method
can outperform the start-of-the-art methods regarding the shift errors and path
similarities.</span>

pose and shape. Though substantial progress has been made in estimating 3D
human motion and shape from dynamic observations, recovering plausible pose
sequences in the presence of noise and occlusions remains a challenge. For this
purpose, we propose an expressive generative model in the form of a conditional
variational autoencoder, which learns a distribution of the change in pose at
each step of a motion sequence. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible
optimization-based approach that leverages HuMoR as a motion prior to robustly
estimate plausible pose and shape from ambiguous observations. Through
extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our model generalizes to diverse
motions and body shapes after training on a large motion capture dataset, and
enables motion reconstruction from multiple input modalities including 3D
keypoints and RGB(-D) videos.</span>

                                        <span>Conditional image synthesis aims to create an image according to some
multi-modal guidance in the forms of textual descriptions, reference images,
and image blocks to preserve, as well as their combinations. In this paper,
instead of investigating these control signals separately, we propose a new
two-stage architecture, UFC-BERT, to unify any number of multi-modal controls.
In UFC-BERT, both the diverse control signals and the synthesized image are
uniformly represented as a sequence of discrete tokens to be processed by
Transformer. Different from existing two-stage autoregressive approaches such
as DALL-E and VQGAN, UFC-BERT adopts non-autoregressive generation (NAR) at the
second stage to enhance the holistic consistency of the synthesized image, to
support preserving specified image blocks, and to improve the synthesis speed.
Further, we design a progressive algorithm that iteratively improves the
non-autoregressively generated image, with the help of two estimators developed
for evaluating the compliance with the controls and evaluating the fidelity of
the synthesized image, respectively. Extensive experiments on a newly collected
large-scale clothing dataset M2C-Fashion and a facial dataset Multi-Modal
CelebA-HQ verify that UFC-BERT can synthesize high-fidelity images that comply
with flexible multi-modal controls.</span>

                                        <span>Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest
X-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
Since manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent
auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and
immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the
COVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the
detected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize
the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning
strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the
knowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize
the acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through
observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report
generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical
findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital
of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of
the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale
Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for
further fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT
achieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report
generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset. The
Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset is available at https://covid19ct.github.io/.</span>

identity features without annotations. Recently, self-supervised contrastive
learning has gained increasing attention for its effectiveness in unsupervised
representation learning. The main idea of instance contrastive learning is to
match a same instance in different augmented views. However, the relationship
between different instances has not been fully explored in previous contrastive
methods, especially for instance-level contrastive loss. To address this issue,
we propose Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE) that leverages
inter-instance pairwise similarity scores to boost previous class-level
contrastive ReID methods. We first use pairwise similarity ranking as one-hot
hard pseudo labels for hard instance contrast, which aims at reducing
intra-class variance. Then, we use similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to
enhance the consistency between augmented and original views, which makes our
model more robust to augmentation perturbations. Experiments on several
large-scale person ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed
unsupervised method ICE, which is competitive with even supervised methods.

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks built from deep convolutional neural networks
(GANs) lack the ability to exactly replicate the high-frequency components of
natural images. To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training
techniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match).
The key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components
from the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents
the discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency
components. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the
low-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural
images. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the
frequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented
as a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it
penalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the
generators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the
real image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and
F-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and
spatial domain on multiple image benchmarks.</span>

all-optically compute a given machine learning or computational imaging task as
the light propagates from the input to the output plane. Here, we report the
design of diffractive optical networks for the classification and
reconstruction of spatially overlapping, phase-encoded objects. When two
different phase-only objects spatially overlap, the individual object functions
are perturbed since their phase patterns are summed up. The retrieval of the
underlying phase images from solely the overlapping phase distribution presents
a challenging problem, the solution of which is generally not unique. We show
that through a task-specific training process, passive diffractive networks
composed of successive transmissive layers can all-optically and simultaneously
classify two different randomly-selected, spatially overlapping phase images at
the input. After trained with ~550 million unique combinations of phase-encoded
handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, our blind testing results reveal
that the diffractive network achieves an accuracy of &gt;85.8% for all-optical
classification of two overlapping phase images of new handwritten digits. In
addition to all-optical classification of overlapping phase objects, we also
demonstrate the reconstruction of these phase images based on a shallow
electronic neural network that uses the highly compressed output of the
diffractive network as its input (with e.g., ~20-65 times less number of
pixels) to rapidly reconstruct both of the phase images, despite their spatial
overlap and related phase ambiguity. The presented phase image classification
and reconstruction framework might find applications in e.g., computational
imaging, microscopy and quantitative phase imaging fields.</span>

demonstrations. Although humans are good drivers, they are not good coaches for
end-to-end algorithms that demand dense on-policy supervision. On the contrary,
automated experts that leverage privileged information can efficiently generate
large scale on-policy and off-policy demonstrations. However, existing
automated experts for urban driving make heavy use of hand-crafted rules and
perform suboptimally even on driving simulators, where ground-truth information
is available. To address these issues, we train a reinforcement learning expert
that maps bird&#x27;s-eye view images to continuous low-level actions. While setting
a new performance upper-bound on CARLA, our expert is also a better coach that
provides informative supervision signals for imitation learning agents to learn
from. Supervised by our reinforcement learning coach, a baseline end-to-end
agent with monocular camera-input achieves expert-level performance. Our

                                        <span>Image denoising is often empowered by accurate prior information. In recent
years, data-driven neural network priors have shown promising performance for
RGB natural image denoising. Compared to classic handcrafted priors (e.g.,
sparsity and total variation), the &quot;deep priors&quot; are learned using a large
number of training samples -- which can accurately model the complex image
generating process. However, data-driven priors are hard to acquire for
hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the lack of training data. A remedy is to
use the so-called unsupervised deep image prior (DIP). Under the unsupervised
DIP framework, it is hypothesized and empirically demonstrated that proper
neural network structures are reasonable priors of certain types of images, and
the network weights can be learned without training data. Nonetheless, the most
effective unsupervised DIP structures were proposed for natural images instead
of HSIs. The performance of unsupervised DIP-based HSI denoising is limited by
a couple of serious challenges, namely, network structure design and network
complexity. This work puts forth an unsupervised DIP framework that is based on
the classic spatio-spectral decomposition of HSIs. Utilizing the so-called
linear mixture model of HSIs, two types of unsupervised DIPs, i.e., U-Net-like
network and fully-connected networks, are employed to model the abundance maps
and endmembers contained in the HSIs, respectively. This way, empirically
validated unsupervised DIP structures for natural images can be easily
incorporated for HSI denoising. Besides, the decomposition also substantially
reduces network complexity. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm is
proposed to handle the formulated denoising problem. Semi-real and real data
experiments are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.</span>

                                        <span>Spatio-temporal action detection is an important and challenging problem in
video understanding. The existing action detection benchmarks are limited in
aspects of small numbers of instances in a trimmed video or low-level atomic
actions. This paper aims to present a new multi-person dataset of
spatio-temporal localized sports actions, coined as MultiSports. We first
analyze the important ingredients of constructing a realistic and challenging
dataset for spatio-temporal action detection by proposing three criteria: (1)
multi-person scenes and motion dependent identification, (2) with well-defined
boundaries, (3) relatively fine-grained classes of high complexity. Based on
these guide-lines, we build the dataset of MultiSports v1.0 by selecting 4
sports classes, collecting 3200 video clips, and annotating 37701 action
instances with 902k bounding boxes. Our datasets are characterized with
important properties of high diversity, dense annotation, and high quality. Our
Multi-Sports, with its realistic setting and detailed annotations, exposes the
intrinsic challenges of spatio-temporal action detection. To benchmark this, we
adapt several baseline methods to our dataset and give an in-depth analysis on
the action detection results in our dataset. We hope our MultiSports can serve
as a standard benchmark for spatio-temporal action detection in the future. Our
dataset website is at https://deeperaction.github.io/multisports/.</span>

                                        <span>Video activity localisation has recently attained increasing attention due to
its practical values in automatically localising the most salient visual
segments corresponding to their language descriptions (sentences) from
untrimmed and unstructured videos. For supervised model training, a temporal
annotation of both the start and end time index of each video segment for a
sentence (a video moment) must be given. This is not only very expensive but
also sensitive to ambiguity and subjective annotation bias, a much harder task
than image labelling. In this work, we develop a more accurate
weakly-supervised solution by introducing Cross-Sentence Relations Mining (CRM)
in video moment proposal generation and matching when only a paragraph
description of activities without per-sentence temporal annotation is
available. Specifically, we explore two cross-sentence relational constraints:
(1) Temporal ordering and (2) semantic consistency among sentences in a
paragraph description of video activities. Existing weakly-supervised
techniques only consider within-sentence video segment correlations in training
without considering cross-sentence paragraph context. This can mislead due to
ambiguous expressions of individual sentences with visually indiscriminate
video moment proposals in isolation. Experiments on two publicly available
activity localisation datasets show the advantages of our approach over the
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, especially so when the video
activity descriptions become more complex.</span>

created new threat vectors for airports and national infrastructures. The
economic damage for a single major airport from drone incursions is estimated
to be millions per day. Due to the lack of diverse drone training data,
accurate training of deep learning detection algorithms under scarce data is an
open challenge. Existing methods largely rely on collecting diverse and
comprehensive experimental drone footage data, artificially induced data
augmentation, transfer and meta-learning, as well as physics-informed learning.
However, these methods cannot guarantee capturing diverse drone designs and
fully understanding the deep feature space of drones. Here, we show how
understanding the general distribution of the drone data via a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and explaining the missing features using Topological
Data Analysis (TDA) - can allow us to acquire missing data to achieve rapid and
more accurate learning. We demonstrate our results on a drone image dataset,
which contains both real drone images as well as simulated images from
computer-aided design. When compared to random data collection (usual practice
- discriminator accuracy of 94.67\% after 200 epochs), our proposed GAN-TDA
informed data collection method offers a significant 4\% improvement (99.42\%
after 200 epochs). We believe that this approach of exploiting general data
distribution knowledge form neural networks can be applied to a wide range of
scarce data open challenges.</span>

presented Directional Truncated Signed Distance Function (DTSDF) is an
augmentation of the regular TSDF and shows potential for more coherent maps and
improved tracking performance. In this work, we present methods for rendering
depth- and color maps from the DTSDF, making it a true drop-in replacement for
the regular TSDF in established trackers. We evaluate and show, that our method
increases re-usability of mapped scenes. Furthermore, we add color integration
which notably improves color-correctness at adjacent surfaces.</span>

                                        <span>Finding local features that are repeatable across multiple views is a
cornerstone of sparse 3D reconstruction. The classical image matching paradigm
detects keypoints per-image once and for all, which can yield poorly-localized
features and propagate large errors to the final geometry. In this paper, we
refine two key steps of structure-from-motion by a direct alignment of
low-level image information from multiple views: we first adjust the initial
keypoint locations prior to any geometric estimation, and subsequently refine
points and camera poses as a post-processing. This refinement is robust to
large detection noise and appearance changes, as it optimizes a featuremetric
error based on dense features predicted by a neural network. This significantly
improves the accuracy of camera poses and scene geometry for a wide range of
keypoint detectors, challenging viewing conditions, and off-the-shelf deep
features. Our system easily scales to large image collections, enabling
pixel-perfect crowd-sourced localization at scale. Our code is publicly

priors with the aim of learning meaningful features. However, this was done
without considering the description length of the learned representations which
is a direct and unbiased measure of the model complexity. In this paper, first
we introduce the $\varphi$ metric that evaluates unsupervised models based on
their reconstruction accuracy and the degree of compression of their internal
representations. We then present and define two activation functions (Identity,
ReLU) as base of reference and three sparse activation functions (top-k
absolutes, Extrema-Pool indices, Extrema) as candidate structures that minimize
the previously defined $\varphi$. We lastly present Sparsely Activated Networks
(SANs) that consist of kernels with shared weights that, during encoding, are
convolved with the input and then passed through a sparse activation function.
During decoding, the same weights are convolved with the sparse activation map
and subsequently the partial reconstructions from each weight are summed to
reconstruct the input. We compare SANs using the five previously defined
activation functions on a variety of datasets (Physionet, UCI-epilepsy, MNIST,
FMNIST) and show that models that are selected using $\varphi$ have small
description representation length and consist of interpretable kernels.</span>

reference dataset for the evaluation of sensing technologies to study plants
under field conditions. The TERRA-REF program deployed a suite of
high-resolution, cutting edge technology sensors on a gantry system with the
aim of scanning 1 hectare (10$^4$) at around 1 mm$^2$ spatial resolution
multiple times per week. The system contains co-located sensors including a
stereo-pair RGB camera, a thermal imager, a laser scanner to capture 3D
structure, and two hyperspectral cameras covering wavelengths of 300-2500nm.
This sensor data is provided alongside over sixty types of traditional plant
phenotype measurements that can be used to train new machine learning models.
Associated weather and environmental measurements, information about agronomic
management and experimental design, and the genomic sequences of hundreds of
plant varieties have been collected and are available alongside the sensor and
plant phenotype data.

Over the course of four years and ten growing seasons, the TERRA-REF system
generated over 1 PB of sensor data and almost 45 million files. The subset that
has been released to the public domain accounts for two seasons and about half
of the total data volume. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for
investigations far beyond the core biological scope of the project.

The focus of this paper is to provide the Computer Vision and Machine
Learning communities an overview of the available data and some potential
applications of this one of a kind data.</span>

                                        <span>The use of gait for person identification has important advantages such as
being non-invasive, unobtrusive, not requiring cooperation and being less
likely to be obscured compared to other biometrics. Existing methods for gait
recognition require cooperative gait scenarios, in which a single person is
walking multiple times in a straight line in front of a camera. We aim to
address the challenges of real-world scenarios in which camera feeds capture
multiple people, who in most cases pass in front of the camera only once. We
address privacy concerns by using only motion information of walking
individuals, with no identifiable appearance-based information. As such, we
propose a novel weakly supervised learning framework, WildGait, which consists
of training a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network on a large number of
automatically annotated skeleton sequences obtained from raw, real-world,
surveillance streams to learn useful gait signatures. We collected the training
data and compiled the largest dataset of walking skeletons called Uncooperative
Wild Gait, containing over 38k tracklets of anonymized walking 2D skeletons. We
release the dataset for public use. Our results show that, with fine-tuning, we
surpass the current state-of-the-art pose-based gait recognition solutions. Our
proposed method is reliable in training gait recognition methods in
unconstrained environments, especially in settings with scarce amounts of
annotated data.</span>

its importance in applications such as autonomous vehicles and indoor robots.
However, most existing methods make predictions based on human-labeled
trajectories and ignore the errors and noises in detection and tracking. In
this paper, we study the problem of human trajectory forecasting in raw videos,
and show that the prediction accuracy can be severely affected by various types
of tracking errors. Accordingly, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to
correct the tracking failures by enforcing prediction consistency over time.
The proposed &quot;re-tracking&quot; algorithm can be applied to any existing tracking
and prediction pipelines. Experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method can improve both tracking and prediction performance
in challenging real-world scenarios. The code and data are available at

to process information in a local neighbourhood with fixed-weight kernels and
aggregate global context hierarchically. However, non-local neural networks and
self-attention for 2D vision have shown that explicitly modeling long-range
interactions can lead to more robust and competitive models. In this paper, we
propose two variants of self-attention for contextual modeling in 3D object
detection by augmenting convolutional features with self-attention features. We
first incorporate the pairwise self-attention mechanism into the current
state-of-the-art BEV, voxel and point-based detectors and show consistent
improvement over strong baseline models of up to 1.5 3D AP while simultaneously
reducing their parameter footprint and computational cost by 15-80% and 30-50%,
respectively, on the KITTI validation set. We next propose a self-attention
variant that samples a subset of the most representative features by learning
deformations over randomly sampled locations. This not only allows us to scale
explicit global contextual modeling to larger point-clouds, but also leads to
more discriminative and informative feature descriptors. Our method can be
flexibly applied to most state-of-the-art detectors with increased accuracy and
parameter and compute efficiency. We show our proposed method improves 3D
object detection performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets. Code

                                        <span>Learning from noisy labels is an important concern because of the lack of
accurate ground-truth labels in plenty of real-world scenarios. In practice,
various approaches for this concern first make some corrections corresponding
to potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update predictive model with
information of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as
medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often
difficult or even impossible for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free
ground-truth labels which leads to labels with complex noise. This situation
raises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making
corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has
limitations due to the complex noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate
evaluation strategy for validation/testing is unclear because of the great
difficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels. In this paper, we
focus on alleviating these two problems. For the problem 1), we present
one-step abductive multi-target learning (OSAMTL) that imposes a one-step
logical reasoning upon machine learning via a multi-target learning procedure
to constrain the predictions of the learning model to be subject to our prior
knowledge about the true target. For the problem 2), we propose a logical
assessment formula (LAF) that evaluates the logical rationality of the outputs
of an approach by estimating the consistencies between the predictions of the

logical reasoning of OSAMTL. Applying OSAMTL and LAF to the Helicobacter pylori
(H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL is able to enable
the machine learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which
is beyond various state-of-the-art approaches in handling complex noisy labels.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise and development of deep learning over the past decade, there
has been a steady momentum of innovation and breakthroughs that convincingly
push the state-of-the-art of cross-modal analytics between vision and language
in multimedia field. Nevertheless, there has not been an open-source codebase
in support of training and deploying numerous neural network models for
cross-modal analytics in a unified and modular fashion. In this work, we
propose X-modaler -- a versatile and high-performance codebase that
encapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several
general-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,
decoder, and decode strategy). Each stage is empowered with the functionality
that covers a series of modules widely adopted in state-of-the-arts and allows
seamless switching in between. This way naturally enables a flexible
implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video
captioning, and vision-language pre-training, aiming to facilitate the rapid
development of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular
designs in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across
different vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power
startup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual
question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.
X-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects
and pre-trained models are available on-line:

                                        <span>Video-Text Retrieval has been a hot research topic with the growth of
multimedia data on the internet. Transformer for video-text learning has
attracted increasing attention due to its promising performance. However,
existing cross-modal transformer approaches typically suffer from two major
limitations: 1) Exploitation of the transformer architecture where different
layers have different feature characteristics is limited; 2) End-to-end
training mechanism limits negative sample interactions in a mini-batch. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Transformer (HiT) for
video-text retrieval. HiT performs Hierarchical Cross-modal Contrastive
Matching in both feature-level and semantic-level, achieving multi-view and
comprehensive retrieval results. Moreover, inspired by MoCo, we propose
Momentum Cross-modal Contrast for cross-modal learning to enable large-scale
negative sample interactions on-the-fly, which contributes to the generation of
more precise and discriminative representations. Experimental results on the
three major Video-Text Retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages
of our method.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a three-tier modality alignment approach to learning
text-image joint embedding, coined as JEMA, for cross-modal retrieval of
cooking recipes and food images. The first tier improves recipe text embedding
by optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced
sequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the
ResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with
word2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint
embedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin
optimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of
cross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further
reduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific
embedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the
image category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint
embedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the
visual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint
embedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark
dataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and
recipe-to-image retrievals.</span>

                                        <span>Internet video delivery has undergone a tremendous explosion of growth over
the past few years. However, the quality of video delivery system greatly
depends on the Internet bandwidth. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized to
improve the quality of video delivery recently. These methods divide a video
into chunks, and stream LR video chunks and corresponding content-aware models
to the client. The client runs the inference of models to super-resolve the LR
chunks. Consequently, a large number of models are streamed in order to deliver
a video. In this paper, we first carefully study the relation between models of
different chunks, then we tactfully design a joint training framework along
with the Content-aware Feature Modulation (CaFM) layer to compress these models
for neural video delivery. {\bf With our method, each video chunk only requires
less than $1\% $ of original parameters to be streamed, achieving even better
SR performance.} We conduct extensive experiments across various SR backbones,
video time length, and scaling factors to demonstrate the advantages of our
method. Besides, our method can be also viewed as a new approach of video
coding. Our primary experiments achieve better video quality compared with the
commercial H.264 and H.265 standard under the same storage cost, showing the
great potential of the proposed method. Code is available

derived by introducing a learned error metric and a latent representation of
the target image, which transforms the MAP objective to a deep feature space.
The deep reparametrization allows us to directly model the image formation
process in the latent space, and to integrate learned image priors into the
prediction. Our approach thereby leverages the advantages of deep learning,
while also benefiting from the principled multi-frame fusion provided by the
classical MAP formulation. We validate our approach through comprehensive

before memorizing the mislabeled samples. Motivated by this early-learning
phenomenon, we propose a novel method to prevent memorization of the mislabeled
samples. Unlike the existing approaches which use the model output to identify

learned to assign large confidence values to correctly-labeled samples and
small confidence values to mislabeled samples. We also propose an auxiliary
regularization term to further improve the robustness of the model. To improve
the performance, we gradually correct the noisy labels with a well-designed
target estimation strategy. We provide the theoretical analysis and conduct the

                                        <span>Recent advances in trajectory prediction have shown that explicit reasoning
about agents&#x27; intent is important to accurately forecast their motion. However,
the current research activities are not directly applicable to intelligent and
safety critical systems. This is mainly because very few public datasets are
available, and they only consider pedestrian-specific intents for a short
temporal horizon from a restricted egocentric view. To this end, we propose
LOKI (LOng term and Key Intentions), a novel large-scale dataset that is
designed to tackle joint trajectory and intention prediction for heterogeneous
traffic agents (pedestrians and vehicles) in an autonomous driving setting. The
LOKI dataset is created to discover several factors that may affect intention,
including i) agent&#x27;s own will, ii) social interactions, iii) environmental
constraints, and iv) contextual information. We also propose a model that
jointly performs trajectory and intention prediction, showing that recurrently
reasoning about intention can assist with trajectory prediction. We show our
method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by upto
$27\%$ and also provide a baseline for frame-wise intention estimation.</span>

                                        <span>Attention mechanism has been regarded as an advanced technique to capture
long-range feature interactions and to boost the representation capability for
convolutional neural networks. However, we found two ignored problems in
current attentional activations-based models: the approximation problem and the
insufficient capacity problem of the attention maps. To solve the two problems
together, we initially propose an attention module for convolutional neural
networks by developing an AW-convolution, where the shape of attention maps
matches that of the weights rather than the activations. Our proposed attention
module is a complementary method to previous attention-based schemes, such as
those that apply the attention mechanism to explore the relationship between
channel-wise and spatial features. Experiments on several datasets for image
classification and object detection tasks show the effectiveness of our
proposed attention module. In particular, our proposed attention module
achieves 1.00% Top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet classification over a
ResNet101 baseline and 0.63 COCO-style Average Precision improvement on the
COCO object detection on top of a Faster R-CNN baseline with the backbone of
ResNet101-FPN. When integrating with the previous attentional activations-based
models, our proposed attention module can further increase their Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet classification by up to 0.57% and COCO-style Average Precision on
the COCO object detection by up to 0.45. Code and pre-trained models will be
publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Object detection is a challenging task in remote sensing because objects only
occupy a few pixels in the images, and the models are required to
simultaneously learn object locations and detection. Even though the
established approaches well perform for the objects of regular sizes, they
achieve weak performance when analyzing small ones or getting stuck in the
local minima (e.g. false object parts). Two possible issues stand in their way.
First, the existing methods struggle to perform stably on the detection of
small objects because of the complicated background. Second, most of the
standard methods used hand-crafted features, and do not work well on the
detection of objects parts of which are missing. We here address the above
issues and propose a new architecture with a multiple patch feature pyramid
network (MPFP-Net). Different from the current models that during training only
pursue the most discriminative patches, in MPFPNet the patches are divided into
class-affiliated subsets, in which the patches are related and based on the
primary loss function, a sequence of smooth loss functions are determined for
the subsets to improve the model for collecting small object parts. To enhance
the feature representation for patch selection, we introduce an effective
method to regularize the residual values and make the fusion transition layers
strictly norm-preserving. The network contains bottom-up and crosswise
connections to fuse the features of different scales to achieve better
accuracy, compared to several state-of-the-art object detection models. Also,
the developed architecture is more efficient than the baselines.</span>

abundant gender information. At present, the academic research of fingerprint
gender characteristics is generally at the level of understanding, while the
standardization research is quite limited. In this work, we propose a more
robust method, Dense Dilated Convolution ResNet (DDC-ResNet) to extract valid
gender information from fingerprints. By replacing the normal convolution
operations with the atrous convolution in the backbone, prior knowledge is
provided to keep the edge details and the global reception field can be
extended. We explored the results in 3 ways: 1) The efficiency of the
DDC-ResNet. 6 typical methods of automatic feature extraction coupling with 9
mainstream classifiers are evaluated in our dataset with fair implementation
details. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of our approach
outperforms other combinations in terms of average accuracy and separate-gender
accuracy. It reaches 96.5% for average and 0.9752 (males)/0.9548 (females) for
separate-gender accuracy. 2) The effect of fingers. It is found that the best
performance of classifying gender with separate fingers is achieved by the
right ring finger. 3) The effect of specific features. Based on the
observations of the concentrations of fingerprints visualized by our approach,
it can be inferred that loops and whorls (level 1), bifurcations (level 2), as
well as line shapes (level 3) are connected with gender. Finally, we will open
source the dataset that contains 6000 fingerprint images</span>

(GAN) with Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction for the complex
scenarios with unknown and even randomly initialized camera poses. Recent
NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view
synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses
estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses
in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and
require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes
randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel
two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the
new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while
the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome
local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive
experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the
effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the
baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures
that are regarded as extremely challenging before.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, FCNs have attracted widespread attention in the CD field. In
pursuit of better CD performance, it has become a tendency to design deeper and
more complicated FCNs, which inevitably brings about huge numbers of parameters
and an unbearable computational burden. With the goal of designing a quite deep
architecture to obtain more precise CD results while simultaneously decreasing
parameter numbers to improve efficiency, in this work, we present a very deep
and efficient CD network, entitled EffCDNet. In EffCDNet, to reduce the
numerous parameters associated with deep architecture, an efficient convolution
consisting of depth-wise convolution and group convolution with a channel
shuffle mechanism is introduced to replace standard convolutional layers. In
terms of the specific network architecture, EffCDNet does not use mainstream
UNet-like architecture, but rather adopts the architecture with a very deep
encoder and a lightweight decoder. In the very deep encoder, two very deep
siamese streams stacked by efficient convolution first extract two highly
representative and informative feature maps from input image-pairs.
Subsequently, an efficient ASPP module is designed to capture multi-scale
change information. In the lightweight decoder, a recurrent criss-cross
self-attention (RCCA) module is applied to efficiently utilize non-local
similar feature representations to enhance discriminability for each pixel,
thus effectively separating the changed and unchanged regions. Moreover, to
tackle the optimization problem in confused pixels, two novel loss functions
based on information entropy are presented. On two challenging CD datasets, our
approach outperforms other SOTA FCN-based methods, with only benchmark-level
parameter numbers and quite low computational overhead.</span>

of oxygen and nutrients to the surrounding cells. Various diseases have been
shown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of
erythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have
been assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a standard
20-second long microvascular video takes on average 20 minutes and requires
extensive training. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders
the application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this
paper, we present a fully automated state-of-the-art system, called
CapillaryNet, that can quantify skin nutritive capillary density and red blood
cell velocity from handheld microscopy videos. Moreover, CapillaryNet measures
several novel microvascular parameters that researchers were previously unable
to quantify, i.e. capillary hematocrit and Intra-capillary flow velocity

                                        <span>Stereo-based 3D detection aims at detecting 3D object bounding boxes from
stereo images using intermediate depth maps or implicit 3D geometry
representations, which provides a low-cost solution for 3D perception. However,
its performance is still inferior compared with LiDAR-based detection
algorithms. To detect and localize accurate 3D bounding boxes, LiDAR-based
models can encode accurate object boundaries and surface normal directions from
LiDAR point clouds. However, the detection results of stereo-based detectors
are easily affected by the erroneous depth features due to the limitation of
stereo matching. To solve the problem, we propose LIGA-Stereo (LiDAR Geometry
Aware Stereo Detector) to learn stereo-based 3D detectors under the guidance of
high-level geometry-aware representations of LiDAR-based detection models. In
addition, we found existing voxel-based stereo detectors failed to learn
semantic features effectively from indirect 3D supervisions. We attach an
auxiliary 2D detection head to provide direct 2D semantic supervisions.
Experiment results show that the above two strategies improved the geometric
and semantic representation capabilities. Compared with the state-of-the-art
stereo detector, our method has improved the 3D detection performance of cars,
pedestrians, cyclists by 10.44%, 5.69%, 5.97% mAP respectively on the official
KITTI benchmark. The gap between stereo-based and LiDAR-based 3D detectors is
further narrowed.</span>

                                        <span>The past year has witnessed the rapid development of applying the Transformer
module to vision problems. While some researchers have demonstrated that
Transformer-based models enjoy a favorable ability of fitting data, there are
still growing number of evidences showing that these models suffer over-fitting
especially when the training data is limited. This paper offers an empirical
study by performing step-by-step operations to gradually transit a
Transformer-based model to a convolution-based model. The results we obtain
during the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual
recognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named
Visformer, which is abbreviated from the &#x60;Vision-friendly Transformer&#x27;. With
the same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the
Transformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet
classification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the
model complexity is lower or the training set is smaller. The code is available

                                        <span>Neural architecture search can discover neural networks with good
performance, and One-Shot approaches are prevalent. One-Shot approaches
typically require a supernet with weight sharing and predictors that predict
the performance of architecture. However, the previous methods take much time
to generate performance predictors thus are inefficient. To this end, we
propose FOX-NAS that consists of fast and explainable predictors based on
simulated annealing and multivariate regression. Our method is
quantization-friendly and can be efficiently deployed to the edge. The
experiments on different hardware show that FOX-NAS models outperform some
other popular neural network architectures. For example, FOX-NAS matches
MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-Lite0 accuracy with 240% and 40% less latency on
the edge CPU. FOX-NAS is the 3rd place winner of the 2020 Low-Power Computer

                                        <span>Based on the powerful feature extraction ability of deep learning
architecture, recently, deep-learning based watermarking algorithms have been
widely studied. The basic framework of such algorithm is the auto-encoder like
end-to-end architecture with an encoder, a noise layer and a decoder. The key
to guarantee robustness is the adversarial training with the differential noise
layer. However, we found that none of the existing framework can well ensure
the robustness against JPEG compression, which is non-differential but is an
essential and important image processing operation. To address such
limitations, we proposed a novel end-to-end training architecture, which
utilizes Mini-Batch of Real and Simulated JPEG compression (MBRS) to enhance
the JPEG robustness. Precisely, for different mini-batches, we randomly choose
one of real JPEG, simulated JPEG and noise-free layer as the noise layer.
Besides, we suggest to utilize the Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks which can
learn better feature in embedding and extracting stage, and propose a &quot;message
processor&quot; to expand the message in a more appreciate way. Meanwhile, to
improve the robustness against crop attack, we propose an additive diffusion
block into the network. The extensive experimental results have demonstrated
the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the
state-of-the-art algorithms. Under the JPEG compression with quality factor
Q&#x3D;50, our models achieve a bit error rate less than 0.01% for extracted
messages, with PSNR larger than 36 for the encoded images, which shows the
well-enhanced robustness against JPEG attack. Besides, under many other
distortions such as Gaussian filter, crop, cropout and dropout, the proposed
framework also obtains strong robustness. The code implemented by PyTorch
\cite{2011torch7} is avaiable in https://github.com/jzyustc/MBRS.</span>

multi-robot cooperative localization (CL) which efficiently fuses environmental
features and loop-closure constraints across time and robots. In particular, we
leverage covariance intersection (CI) to allow each robot to only estimate its
own state and autocovariance and compensate for the unknown correlations
between robots. Two novel multi-robot methods for utilizing common
environmental SLAM features are introduced and evaluated in terms of accuracy
and efficiency. Moreover, we adapt CI to enable drift-free estimation through
the use of loop-closure measurement constraints to other robots&#x27; historical
poses without a significant increase in computational cost. The proposed

to obtain per-pixel ground truth labels from real images. We address this
challenge by introducing Hypersim, a photorealistic synthetic dataset for
holistic indoor scene understanding. To create our dataset, we leverage a large
repository of synthetic scenes created by professional artists, and we generate
77,400 images of 461 indoor scenes with detailed per-pixel labels and
corresponding ground truth geometry. Our dataset: (1) relies exclusively on
publicly available 3D assets; (2) includes complete scene geometry, material
information, and lighting information for every scene; (3) includes dense
per-pixel semantic instance segmentations and complete camera information for
every image; and (4) factors every image into diffuse reflectance, diffuse
illumination, and a non-diffuse residual term that captures view-dependent
lighting effects.

We analyze our dataset at the level of scenes, objects, and pixels, and we
analyze costs in terms of money, computation time, and annotation effort.
Remarkably, we find that it is possible to generate our entire dataset from
scratch, for roughly half the cost of training a popular open-source natural
language processing model. We also evaluate sim-to-real transfer performance on
two real-world scene understanding tasks - semantic segmentation and 3D shape
prediction - where we find that pre-training on our dataset significantly
improves performance on both tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the most challenging Pix3D test set. All of our rendered image data, as well
as all the code we used to generate our dataset and perform our experiments, is

                                        <span>Vision Transformer (ViT) extends the application range of transformers from
language processing to computer vision tasks as being an alternative
architecture against the existing convolutional neural networks (CNN). Since
the transformer-based architecture has been innovative for computer vision
modeling, the design convention towards an effective architecture has been less
studied yet. From the successful design principles of CNN, we investigate the
role of spatial dimension conversion and its effectiveness on transformer-based
architecture. We particularly attend to the dimension reduction principle of
CNNs; as the depth increases, a conventional CNN increases channel dimension
and decreases spatial dimensions. We empirically show that such a spatial
dimension reduction is beneficial to a transformer architecture as well, and
propose a novel Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT) upon the original ViT
model. We show that PiT achieves the improved model capability and
generalization performance against ViT. Throughout the extensive experiments,
we further show PiT outperforms the baseline on several tasks such as image
classification, object detection, and robustness evaluation. Source codes and

                                        <span>Bicubic downscaling is a prevalent technique used to reduce the video storage
burden or to accelerate the downstream processing speed. However, the inverse
upscaling step is non-trivial, and the downscaled video may also deteriorate
the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a
self-conditioned probabilistic framework for video rescaling to learn the
paired downscaling and upscaling procedures simultaneously. During the
training, we decrease the entropy of the information lost in the downscaling by
maximizing its probability conditioned on the strong spatial-temporal prior
information within the downscaled video. After optimization, the downscaled
video by our framework preserves more meaningful information, which is
beneficial for both the upscaling step and the downstream tasks, e.g., video
action recognition task. We further extend the framework to a lossy video
compression system, in which a gradient estimator for non-differential
industrial lossy codecs is proposed for the end-to-end training of the whole
system. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
approach on video rescaling, video compression, and efficient action
recognition tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Physical photographs now can be conveniently scanned by smartphones and
stored forever as a digital version, yet the scanned photos are not restored
well. One solution is to train a supervised deep neural network on many digital
photos and the corresponding scanned photos. However, it requires a high labor
cost, leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by
simulating degradation using image processing techniques. Their synthetic
images are formed with perfectly scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the
real-world degradation in smartphone photo scanning remains unsolved since it
is more complicated due to lens defocus, lighting conditions, losing details
via printing. Besides, locally structural misalignment still occurs in data due
to distorted shapes captured in a 3-D world, reducing restoration performance
and the reliability of the quantitative evaluation. To solve these problems, we
propose a semi-supervised Deep Photo Scan (DPScan). First, we present a way of
producing real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for
smartphone-scanned photo restoration. Also, Local Alignment is proposed to
reduce the minor misalignment remaining in data. Second, we simulate many
different variants of the real-world degradation using low-level image
transformation to gain a generalization in smartphone-scanned image properties,
then train a degradation network to generalize all styles of degradation and
provide pseudo-scanned photos for unscanned images as if they were scanned by a
smartphone. Finally, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning that allows our
restoration network to be trained on both scanned and unscanned images,
diversifying training image content. As a result, the proposed DPScan
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms its baseline architecture,
state-of-the-art academic research, and industrial products in smartphone photo
scanning.</span>

                                        <span>In a real-world scenario, human actions are typically out of the distribution
from training data, which requires a model to both recognize the known actions
and reject the unknown. Different from image data, video actions are more
challenging to be recognized in an open-set setting due to the uncertain
temporal dynamics and static bias of human actions. In this paper, we propose a
Deep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method to recognize actions in an
open testing set. Specifically, we formulate the action recognition problem
from the evidential deep learning (EDL) perspective and propose a novel model
calibration method to regularize the EDL training. Besides, to mitigate the
static bias of video representation, we propose a plug-and-play module to
debias the learned representation through contrastive learning. Experimental
results show that our DEAR method achieves consistent performance gain on
multiple mainstream action recognition models and benchmarks. Code and

                                        <span>3D LiDAR (light detection and ranging) semantic segmentation is important in
scene understanding for many applications, such as auto-driving and robotics.
For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and LiDAR, it is
crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors for robust and
accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however, may not achieve
promising performance due to the vast difference between the two modalities. In
this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called perception-aware
multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information from two
modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and spatio-depth
information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point clouds to
the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB images.
Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two
modalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based
fusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to
measure the perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For
example, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8 in
mIoU.</span>

super-resolution that multiple possible reconstructions exist for a given
low-resolution image. Using normalizing flows, SRflow[23] achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual quality by learning the distribution of the output
instead of a deterministic output to one estimate. In this paper, we adapt the
concepts of SRFlow to improve GAN-based super-resolution by properly
implementing the one-to-many property. We modify the generator to estimate a
distribution as a mapping from random noise. We improve the content loss that
hampers the perceptual training objectives. We also propose additional training
techniques to further enhance the perceptual quality of generated images. Using
our proposed methods, we were able to improve the performance of ESRGAN[1] in
x4 perceptual SR and achieve the state-of-the-art LPIPS score in x16 perceptual
extreme SR by applying our methods to RFB-ESRGAN[21].</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models can synthesize photorealistic images of human faces
with novel identities. However, a key challenge to the wide applicability of
such techniques is to provide independent control over semantically meaningful
parameters: appearance, head pose, face shape, and facial expressions. In this
paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our knowledge the first method that
learns a variational latent feature space of neural face textures, which allows
sampling of novel identities. We combine this generative model with a
parametric face model and gain explicit control over head pose and facial
expressions. To generate complete images of human heads, we propose an additive
decoder that adds plausible details such as hair. A novel training scheme
enforces a pose-independent latent space and in consequence, allows learning a
one-to-many mapping between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions.
The resulting method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel
identities under fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial
expressions. This facilitates a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling
novel identities, changing the head pose, expression transfer, and more. Code
and models are available for research on https://mcbuehler.github.io/VariTex.</span>

                                        <span>Instance segmentation models today are very accurate when trained on large
annotated datasets, but collecting mask annotations at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We address the partially supervised instance segmentation problem in
which one can train on (significantly cheaper) bounding boxes for all
categories but use masks only for a subset of categories. In this work, we
focus on a popular family of models which apply differentiable cropping to a
feature map and predict a mask based on the resulting crop. Under this family,
we study Mask R-CNN and discover that instead of its default strategy of
training the mask-head with a combination of proposals and groundtruth boxes,
training the mask-head with only groundtruth boxes dramatically improves its
performance on novel classes. This training strategy also allows us to take
advantage of alternative mask-head architectures, which we exploit by replacing
the typical mask-head of 2-4 layers with significantly deeper off-the-shelf
architectures (e.g. ResNet, Hourglass models). While many of these
architectures perform similarly when trained in fully supervised mode, our main
finding is that they can generalize to novel classes in dramatically different
ways. We call this ability of mask-heads to generalize to unseen classes the
strong mask generalization effect and show that without any specialty modules
or losses, we can achieve state-of-the-art results in the partially supervised
COCO instance segmentation benchmark. Finally, we demonstrate that our effect
is general, holding across underlying detection methodologies (including
anchor-based, anchor-free or no detector at all) and across different backbone
networks. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://git.io/deepmac.</span>

                                        <span>The recently proposed Visual image Transformers (ViT) with pure attention
have achieved promising performance on image recognition tasks, such as image
classification. However, the routine of the current ViT model is to maintain a
full-length patch sequence during inference, which is redundant and lacks
hierarchical representation. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Visual
Transformer (HVT) which progressively pools visual tokens to shrink the
sequence length and hence reduces the computational cost, analogous to the
feature maps downsampling in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It brings a
great benefit that we can increase the model capacity by scaling dimensions of
depth/width/resolution/patch size without introducing extra computational
complexity due to the reduced sequence length. Moreover, we empirically find
that the average pooled visual tokens contain more discriminative information
than the single class token. To demonstrate the improved scalability of our
HVT, we conduct extensive experiments on the image classification task. With
comparable FLOPs, our HVT outperforms the competitive baselines on ImageNet and
CIFAR-100 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/MonashAI/HVT</span>

representation for articulated objects learned from images. While recent
advances in 3D implicit representation have made it possible to learn models of
complex objects, learning pose-controllable representations of articulated
objects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervision
and are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representation
of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation
of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D
location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes
without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully
differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover,
through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over
multiple instances of an object class. Experiments show that the proposed
method is efficient and can generalize well to novel poses. The code is

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are known to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial
examples under white-box setting. Moreover, the malicious adversaries crafted
on the surrogate (source) model often exhibit black-box transferability on
other models with the same learning task but having different architectures.
Recently, various methods are proposed to boost the adversarial
transferability, among which the input transformation is one of the most
effective approaches. We investigate in this direction and observe that
existing transformations are all applied on a single image, which might limit
the adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a new input
transformation based attack method called Admix that considers the input image
and a set of images randomly sampled from other categories. Instead of directly
calculating the gradient on the original input, Admix calculates the gradient
on the input image admixed with a small portion of each add-in image while
using the original label of the input to craft more transferable adversaries.
Empirical evaluations on standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Admix could
achieve significantly better transferability than existing input transformation
methods under both single model setting and ensemble-model setting. By
incorporating with existing input transformations, our method could further
improve the transferability and outperforms the state-of-the-art combination of
input transformations by a clear margin when attacking nine advanced defense
models under ensemble-model setting. Code is available at

                                        <span>Multi-level feature fusion is a fundamental topic in computer vision. It has
been exploited to detect, segment and classify objects at various scales. When
multi-level features meet multi-modal cues, the optimal feature aggregation and
multi-modal learning strategy become a hot potato. In this paper, we leverage
the inherent multi-modal and multi-level nature of RGB-D salient object
detection to devise a novel cascaded refinement network. In particular, first,
we propose to regroup the multi-level features into teacher and student
features using a bifurcated backbone strategy (BBS). Second, we introduce a
depth-enhanced module (DEM) to excavate informative depth cues from the channel
and spatial views. Then, RGB and depth modalities are fused in a complementary
way. Our architecture, named Bifurcated Backbone Strategy Network (BBS-Net), is
simple, efficient, and backbone-independent. Extensive experiments show that
BBS-Net significantly outperforms eighteen SOTA models on eight challenging
datasets under five evaluation measures, demonstrating the superiority of our
approach ($\sim 4 \%$ improvement in S-measure $vs.$ the top-ranked model:
DMRA-iccv2019). In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the
generalization ability of different RGB-D datasets and provide a powerful
training set for future research.</span>

                                        <span>Metric learning has received conflicting assessments concerning its
suitability for solving instance segmentation tasks. It has been dismissed as
theoretically flawed due to the shift equivariance of the employed CNNs and
their respective inability to distinguish same-looking objects. Yet it has been
shown to yield state of the art results for a variety of tasks, and practical
issues have mainly been reported in the context of tile-and-stitch approaches,
where discontinuities at tile boundaries have been observed. To date, neither
of the reported issues have undergone thorough formal analysis. In our work, we
contribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties
of encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and
cannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects. In
particular, we prove that a standard encoder-decoder network that takes
$d$-dimensional images as input, with $l$ pooling layers and pooling factor
$f$, has the capacity to distinguish at most $f^{dl}$ same-looking objects, and
we show that this upper limit can be reached. Furthermore, we show that to
avoid discontinuities in a tile-and-stitch approach, assuming standard batch
size 1, it is necessary to employ valid convolutions in combination with a
training output window size strictly greater than $f^l$, while at test-time it
is necessary to crop tiles to size $n\cdot f^l$ before stitching, with $n\geq
1$. We complement these theoretical findings by discussing a number of
insightful special cases for which we show empirical results on synthetic data.</span>

RGB image as input. The main insight is that simply shrink-wrapping a planar
mesh sheet onto the input image, consistent with the learned intermediate
depth, captures underlying geometry sufficient to generate photorealistic
unseen views with large viewpoint changes. To operationalize this, we propose a
novel differentiable texture sampler that allows our wrapped mesh sheet to be
textured and rendered differentiably into an image from a target viewpoint. Our
approach is category-agnostic, end-to-end trainable without using any 3D
supervision, and requires a single image at test time. We also explore a simple
extension by stacking multiple layers of Worldsheets to better handle
occlusions. Worldsheet consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods
on single-image view synthesis across several datasets. Furthermore, this
simple idea captures novel views surprisingly well on a wide range of
high-resolution in-the-wild images, converting them into navigable 3D pop-ups.

                                        <span>For all the ways convolutional neural nets have revolutionized computer
vision in recent years, one important aspect has received surprisingly little
attention: the effect of image size on the accuracy of tasks being trained for.
Typically, to be efficient, the input images are resized to a relatively small
spatial resolution (e.g. 224x224), and both training and inference are carried
out at this resolution. The actual mechanism for this re-scaling has been an
afterthought: Namely, off-the-shelf image resizers such as bilinear and bicubic
are commonly used in most machine learning software frameworks. But do these
resizers limit the on task performance of the trained networks? The answer is
yes. Indeed, we show that the typical linear resizer can be replaced with
learned resizers that can substantially improve performance. Importantly, while
the classical resizers typically result in better perceptual quality of the
downscaled images, our proposed learned resizers do not necessarily give better
visual quality, but instead improve task performance. Our learned image resizer
is jointly trained with a baseline vision model. This learned CNN-based resizer
creates machine friendly visual manipulations that lead to a consistent
improvement of the end task metric over the baseline model. Specifically, here
we focus on the classification task with the ImageNet dataset, and experiment
with four different models to learn resizers adapted to each model. Moreover,
we show that the proposed resizer can also be useful for fine-tuning the
classification baselines for other vision tasks. To this end, we experiment
with three different baselines to develop image quality assessment (IQA) models
on the AVA dataset.</span>

are usually annotated by some commonly used attributes (e.g., gender), while
labels for the other attributes (e.g., big nose) are limited which causes their
prediction challenging. To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task
Learning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the
knowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization
performance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it
is assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial
attributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,
predictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a
limited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the
coefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task
is represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed
that the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters
of the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.
Our MTL methods are compared with competing methods for facial attribute
prediction to show its effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>The automation of neural architecture design has been a coveted alternative
to human experts. Recent works have small search space, which is easier to
optimize but has a limited upper bound of the optimal solution. Extra human
design is needed for those methods to propose a more suitable space with
respect to the specific task and algorithm capacity. To further enhance the
degree of automation for neural architecture search, we present a Neural
Search-space Evolution (NSE) scheme that iteratively amplifies the results from
the previous effort by maintaining an optimized search space subset. This
design minimizes the necessity of a well-designed search space. We further
extend the flexibility of obtainable architectures by introducing a learnable
multi-branch setting. By employing the proposed method, a consistent
performance gain is achieved during a progressive search over upcoming search
spaces. We achieve 77.3% top-1 retrain accuracy on ImageNet with 333M FLOPs,
which yielded a state-of-the-art performance among previous auto-generated
architectures that do not involve knowledge distillation or weight pruning.
When the latency constraint is adopted, our result also performs better than
the previous best-performing mobile models with a 77.9% Top-1 retrain accuracy.</span>

poses a fundamental challenge in appearance-based visual tracking. Such
distractor objects are easily misclassified as the target itself, leading to
eventual tracking failure. While most methods strive to suppress distractors
through more powerful appearance models, we take an alternative approach.

We propose to keep track of distractor objects in order to continue tracking
the target. To this end, we introduce a learned association network, allowing
us to propagate the identities of all target candidates from frame-to-frame. To
tackle the problem of lacking ground-truth correspondences between distractor
objects in visual tracking, we propose a training strategy that combines
partial annotations with self-supervision. We conduct comprehensive
experimental validation and analysis of our approach on several challenging
datasets. Our tracker sets a new state-of-the-art on six benchmarks, achieving
an AUC score of 67.1% on LaSOT and a +5.8% absolute gain on the OxUvA long-term

for nonlinear function approximation. In order to achieve good generalization
on unseen data, a suitable inductive bias is of great importance for neural
networks. One of the most straightforward ways is to regularize the neural
network with some additional objectives. L2 regularization serves as a standard
regularization for neural networks. Despite its popularity, it essentially
regularizes one dimension of the individual neuron, which is not strong enough
to control the capacity of highly over-parameterized neural networks. Motivated
by this, hyperspherical uniformity is proposed as a novel family of relational
regularizations that impact the interaction among neurons. We consider several
geometrically distinct ways to achieve hyperspherical uniformity. The
effectiveness of hyperspherical uniformity is justified by theoretical insights
and empirical evaluations.</span>

first step in studying their evolution in a corpus of similar manuscripts is to
identify which ones correspond to each other. This image collation task is
daunting for manuscripts separated by many lost copies, spreading over
centuries, which might have been completely re-organized and greatly modified
to adapt to novel knowledge or belief and include hundreds of illustrations.
Our contributions in this paper are threefold. First, we introduce the task of
illustration collation and a large annotated public dataset to evaluate
solutions, including 6 manuscripts of 2 different texts with more than 2 000
illustrations and 1 200 annotated correspondences. Second, we analyze state of
the art similarity measures for this task and show that they succeed in simple
cases but struggle for large manuscripts when the illustrations have undergone
very significant changes and are discriminated only by fine details. Finally,
we show clear evidence that significant performance boosts can be expected by
exploiting cycle-consistent correspondences. Our code and data are available on

                                        <span>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) marks a milestone in Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), boasting simplicity and small search costs. However,
DARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some
operations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the
architecture. In this paper, we are the first to point out that the phenomenon
is attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely
uses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture
parameters simultaneously with the same data batch. Even single-level
optimization has been previously attempted, no literature provides a systematic
explanation on this essential point. Replacing the bi-level optimization,
Single-DARTS obviously alleviates performance collapse as well as enhances the
stability of architecture search. Experiment results show that Single-DARTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream search spaces. For
instance, on NAS-Benchmark-201, the searched architectures are nearly optimal
ones. We also validate that the single-level optimization framework is much
more stable than the bi-level one. We hope that this simple yet effective
method will give some insights on differential architecture search. The code is

                                        <span>RGB-D saliency detection has attracted increasing attention, due to its
effectiveness and the fact that depth cues can now be conveniently captured.
Existing works often focus on learning a shared representation through various
fusion strategies, with few methods explicitly considering how to preserve
modality-specific characteristics. In this paper, taking a new perspective, we
propose a specificity-preserving network (SP-Net) for RGB-D saliency detection,
which benefits saliency detection performance by exploring both the shared
information and modality-specific properties (e.g., specificity). Specifically,
two modality-specific networks and a shared learning network are adopted to
generate individual and shared saliency maps. A cross-enhanced integration
module (CIM) is proposed to fuse cross-modal features in the shared learning
network, which are then propagated to the next layer for integrating
cross-level information. Besides, we propose a multi-modal feature aggregation
(MFA) module to integrate the modality-specific features from each individual
decoder into the shared decoder, which can provide rich complementary
multi-modal information to boost the saliency detection performance. Further, a
skip connection is used to combine hierarchical features between the encoder
and decoder layers. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
SP-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at:

major challenges: learning novel classes from only few samples per class,
preventing catastrophic forgetting of base classes, and classifier calibration
across novel and base classes. In this work we propose a three-stage framework
that allows to explicitly and effectively address these challenges. While the
first phase learns base classes with many samples, the second phase learns a
calibrated classifier for novel classes from few samples while also preventing
catastrophic forgetting. In the final phase, calibration is achieved across all
classes. We evaluate the proposed framework on four challenging benchmark

endoscopy, which can only be performed by doctors, X-ray imaging can also be
performed by radiographers, and thus, can treat more patients. However, the
diagnostic accuracy of gastric radiographs is as low as 85%. To address this
problem, highly accurate and quantitative automated diagnosis using machine
learning needs to be performed. This paper proposes a diagnostic support method
for detecting gastric cancer sites from X-ray images with high accuracy. The
two new technical proposal of the method are (1) stochastic functional gastric
image augmentation (sfGAIA), and (2) hard boundary box training (HBBT). The
former is a probabilistic enhancement of gastric folds in X-ray images based on
medical knowledge, whereas the latter is a recursive retraining technique to
reduce false positives. We use 4,724 gastric radiographs of 145 patients in
clinical practice and evaluate the cancer detection performance of the method
in a patient-based five-group cross-validation. The proposed sfGAIA and HBBT
significantly enhance the performance of the EfficientDet-D7 network by 5.9% in
terms of the F1-score, and our screening method reaches a practical screening
capability for gastric cancer (F1: 57.8%, recall: 90.2%, precision: 42.5%).</span>

                                        <span>Learning RAW-to-sRGB mapping has drawn increasing attention in recent years,
wherein an input raw image is trained to imitate the target sRGB image captured
by another camera. However, the severe color inconsistency makes it very
challenging to generate well-aligned training pairs of input raw and target
sRGB images. While learning with inaccurately aligned supervision is prone to
causing pixel shift and producing blurry results. In this paper, we circumvent
such issue by presenting a joint learning model for image alignment and
RAW-to-sRGB mapping. To diminish the effect of color inconsistency in image
alignment, we introduce to use a global color mapping (GCM) module to generate
an initial sRGB image given the input raw image, which can keep the spatial
location of the pixels unchanged, and the target sRGB image is utilized to
guide GCM for converting the color towards it. Then a pre-trained optical flow
estimation network (e.g., PWC-Net) is deployed to warp the target sRGB image to
align with the GCM output. To alleviate the effect of inaccurately aligned
supervision, the warped target sRGB image is leveraged to learn RAW-to-sRGB
mapping. When training is done, the GCM module and optical flow network can be
detached, thereby bringing no extra computation cost for inference. Experiments
show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts on ZRR and
SR-RAW datasets. With our joint learning model, a light-weight backbone can
achieve better quantitative and qualitative performance on ZRR dataset. Codes

Tuning model of visual attention for complex real-world visuospatial tasks and
behaviors. However, knowledge of how humans solve such tasks in 3D as active
observers is lean. We thus devised a novel experimental setup and examined such
behavior. We discovered that humans exhibit a variety of problem-solving
strategies whose breadth and complexity are surprising and not easily handled
by current methodologies. It is apparent that solution methods are dynamically
composed by hypothesizing sequences of actions, testing them, and if they fail,
trying different ones. The importance of active observation is striking as is
the lack of any learning effect. These results inform our Cognitive Program

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaption has proven to be an effective approach for
alleviating the intensive workload of manual annotation by aligning the
synthetic source-domain data and the real-world target-domain samples.
Unfortunately, mapping the target-domain distribution to the source-domain
unconditionally may distort the essential structural information of the
target-domain data. To this end, we firstly propose to introduce a novel
multi-anchor based active learning strategy to assist domain adaptation
regarding the semantic segmentation task. By innovatively adopting multiple
anchors instead of a single centroid, the source domain can be better
characterized as a multimodal distribution, thus more representative and
complimentary samples are selected from the target domain. With little workload
to manually annotate these active samples, the distortion of the target-domain
distribution can be effectively alleviated, resulting in a large performance
gain. The multi-anchor strategy is additionally employed to model the
target-distribution. By regularizing the latent representation of the target
samples compact around multiple anchors through a novel soft alignment loss,
more precise segmentation can be achieved. Extensive experiments are conducted
on public datasets to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods significantly, along with thorough ablation study to
verify the effectiveness of each component.</span>

In this study, we aim to address the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) problem as one
of the open challenges in medical imaging. In this research, we propose a new
lesion detection architecture, comprising of two sub-modules, which is an
optimal solution to detect and find not only the type of lesions caused by DR,
their corresponding bounding boxes, and their masks; but also the severity
level of the overall case. Aside from traditional accuracy, we also use two
popular evaluation criteria to evaluate the outputs of our models, which are
intersection over union (IOU) and mean average precision (mAP). We hypothesize
that this new solution enables specialists to detect lesions with high

(VidSGG), which could serve as a structured video representation for high-level
understanding tasks. We present a new {\em detect-to-track} paradigm for this
task by decoupling the context modeling for relation prediction from the
complicated low-level entity tracking. Specifically, we design an efficient
method for frame-level VidSGG, termed as {\em Target Adaptive Context
Aggregation Network} (TRACE), with a focus on capturing spatio-temporal context
information for relation recognition. Our TRACE framework streamlines the
VidSGG pipeline with a modular design, and presents two unique blocks of
Hierarchical Relation Tree (HRTree) construction and Target-adaptive Context
Aggregation. More specific, our HRTree first provides an adpative structure for
organizing possible relation candidates efficiently, and guides context
aggregation module to effectively capture spatio-temporal structure
information. Then, we obtain a contextualized feature representation for each
relation candidate and build a classification head to recognize its relation
category. Finally, we provide a simple temporal association strategy to track
TRACE detected results to yield the video-level VidSGG. We perform experiments
on two VidSGG benchmarks: ImageNet-VidVRD and Action Genome, and the results
demonstrate that our TRACE achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The code

data from the India Driving Dataset (IDD). Our approach, DualFusion, combines
object detectors in a manner that allows us to learn to detect rare objects

detector on the abundant classes. In the IDD OpenSet incremental few-shot

recover a full 3D model consisting of both a triangular mesh and a texture map
from the colored 3D point cloud. Different from previous methods either
exploiting 2D self-prior for image editing or 3D self-prior for pure surface
reconstruction, we propose to exploit a novel hybrid 2D-3D self-prior in deep
neural networks to significantly improve the geometry quality and produce a
high-resolution texture map, which is typically missing from the output of
commodity-level 3D scanners. In particular, we first generate an initial mesh
using a 3D convolutional neural network with 3D self-prior, and then encode
both 3D information and color information in the 2D UV atlas, which is further
refined by 2D convolutional neural networks with the self-prior. In this way,
both 2D and 3D self-priors are utilized for the mesh and texture recovery.

architectural reconstruction from an aerial image. Starting from a potentially
imperfect building reconstruction by an existing algorithm, our approach 1)
explores the space of building models by modifying the reconstruction via
heuristic actions; 2) learns to classify the correctness of building models
while generating classification labels based on the ground-truth, and 3)
repeat. At test time, we iterate exploration and classification, seeking for a
result with the best classification score. We evaluate the approach using
initial reconstructions by two baselines and two state-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
that our approach consistently improves the reconstruction quality from every
initial reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>As one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision,
object detection tries to locate object instances and find their categories in
natural images. The most important step in the evaluation of object detection
algorithm is calculating the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the
predicted bounding box and the ground truth one. Although this procedure is
well-defined and solved for planar images, it is not easy for spherical image
object detection. Existing methods either compute the IoUs based on biased
bounding box representations or make excessive approximations, thus would give
incorrect results. In this paper, we first identify that spherical rectangles
are unbiased bounding boxes for objects in spherical images, and then propose
an analytical method for IoU calculation without any approximations. Based on
the unbiased representation and calculation, we also present an anchor free
object detection algorithm for spherical images. The experiments on two
spherical object detection datasets show that the proposed method can achieve
better performance than existing methods.</span>

intractability of collecting a new large-scale dataset which has plentiful
images with large diversity in density, scene, etc. Thus, for learning a
general model, training with data from multiple different datasets might be a
remedy and be of great value. In this paper, we resort to the multi-domain
joint learning and propose a simple but effective Domain-specific Knowledge
Propagating Network (DKPNet)1 for unbiasedly learning the knowledge from
multiple diverse data domains at the same time. It is mainly achieved by
proposing the novel Variational Attention(VA) technique for explicitly modeling
the attention distributions for different domains. And as an extension to VA,
Intrinsic Variational Attention(InVA) is proposed to handle the problems of
over-lapped domains and sub-domains. Extensive experiments have been conducted
to validate the superiority of our DKPNet over several popular datasets,
including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF and NWPU.</span>

core research challenge is to generate images from arbitrarily complex
distributions with little supervision. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
as an implicit approach have achieved great successes in this direction and
therefore been employed widely. However, GANs are known to suffer from issues
such as mode collapse, non-structured latent space, being unable to compute
likelihoods, etc. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised non-parametric
method named mixture of infinite conditional GANs or MIC-GANs, to tackle
several GAN issues together, aiming for image generation with parsimonious
prior knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluations across different datasets,
we show that MIC-GANs are effective in structuring the latent space and
avoiding mode collapse, and outperform state-of-the-art methods. MICGANs are
adaptive, versatile, and robust. They offer a promising solution to several
well-known GAN issues. Code available: github.com/yinghdb/MICGANs.</span>

has been applied in many machine vision areas. However, to achieve an entire
surrounding 360-degree geometric sensing, traditional stereo matching
algorithms for depth estimation are limited due to large noise, low accuracy,
and strict requirements for multi-camera calibration. In this work, for a
unified surrounding perception, we introduce panoramic images to obtain larger
field of view. We extend PADENet first appeared in our previous conference work
for outdoor scene understanding, to perform panoramic monocular depth
estimation with a focus for indoor scenes. At the same time, we improve the
training process of the neural network adapted to the characteristics of
panoramic images. In addition, we fuse traditional stereo matching algorithm
with deep learning methods and further improve the accuracy of depth
predictions. With a comprehensive variety of experiments, this research
demonstrates the effectiveness of our schemes aiming for indoor scene

paper focuses on addressing this problem. Firstly, we propose two small-scale

Secondly, we introduce channel-temporal attention blocks to capture the
channel-wise and temporal-wise relationships and model their inter-dependencies

                                        <span>With the recent success of deep neural networks, remarkable progress has been
achieved on face recognition. However, collecting large-scale real-world
training data for face recognition has turned out to be challenging, especially
due to the label noise and privacy issues. Meanwhile, existing face recognition
datasets are usually collected from web images, lacking detailed annotations on
attributes (e.g., pose and expression), so the influences of different
attributes on face recognition have been poorly investigated. In this paper, we
address the above-mentioned issues in face recognition using synthetic face
images, i.e., SynFace. Specifically, we first explore the performance gap
between recent state-of-the-art face recognition models trained with synthetic
and real face images. We then analyze the underlying causes behind the
performance gap, e.g., the poor intra-class variations and the domain gap
between synthetic and real face images. Inspired by this, we devise the SynFace
with identity mixup (IM) and domain mixup (DM) to mitigate the above
performance gap, demonstrating the great potentials of synthetic data for face
recognition. Furthermore, with the controllable face synthesis model, we can
easily manage different factors of synthetic face generation, including pose,
expression, illumination, the number of identities, and samples per identity.
Therefore, we also perform a systematically empirical analysis on synthetic
face images to provide some insights on how to effectively utilize synthetic
data for face recognition.</span>

effect in a specific resolution data set. With the purpose of improving change
detection effectiveness of the model in the multi-resolution data set, a
weighted rich-scale inception coder network (WRICNet) is proposed in this
article, which can make a great fusion of shallow multi-scale features, and
deep multi-scale features. The weighted rich-scale inception module of the

module can obtain deep multi-scale features. The weighted scale block assigns
appropriate weights to features of different scales, which can strengthen
expressive ability of the edge of the changing area. The performance
experiments on the multi-resolution data set demonstrate that, compared to the

                                        <span>Applying feature dependent network weights have been proved to be effective
in many fields. However, in practice, restricted by the enormous size of model
parameters and memory footprints, scalable and versatile dynamic convolutions
with per-pixel adapted filters are yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we
address this challenge by decomposing filters, adapted to each spatial
position, over dynamic filter atoms generated by a light-weight network from
local features. Adaptive receptive fields can be supported by further
representing each filter atom over sets of pre-fixed multi-scale bases. As
plug-and-play replacements to convolutional layers, the introduced adaptive
convolutions with per-pixel dynamic atoms enable explicit modeling of
intra-image variance, while avoiding heavy computation, parameters, and memory
cost. Our method preserves the appealing properties of conventional
convolutions as being translation-equivariant and parametrically efficient. We
present experiments to show that, the proposed method delivers comparable or
even better performance across tasks, and are particularly effective on
handling tasks with significant intra-image variance.</span>

                                        <span>Advanced self-supervised visual representation learning methods rely on the
instance discrimination (ID) pretext task. We point out that the ID task has an
implicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in
unconstrained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive mask
prediction (CMP) task for visual representation learning and design a mask
contrast (MaskCo) framework to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts
region-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possible
to identify the positive sample without any assumptions. To solve the domain
gap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction
head in MaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP.
We evaluated MaskCo on training datasets beyond ImageNet and compare its
performance with MoCo V2. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable
performance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a
stronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual
Captions are used for training. MaskCo provides a promising alternative to the
ID-based methods for self-supervised learning in the wild.</span>

dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG). However, most available
resources are still in standard dynamic range (SDR). Therefore, there is an
urgent demand to transform existing SDR-TV contents into their HDR-TV versions.
In this paper, we conduct an analysis of SDRTV-to-HDRTV task by modeling the
formation of SDRTV/HDRTV content. Base on the analysis, we propose a three-step
solution pipeline including adaptive global color mapping, local enhancement
and highlight generation. Moreover, the above analysis inspires us to present a
lightweight network that utilizes global statistics as guidance to conduct
image-adaptive color mapping. In addition, we construct a dataset using HDR
videos in HDR10 standard, named HDRTV1K, and select five metrics to evaluate
the results of SDRTV-to-HDRTV algorithms. Furthermore, our final results
achieve state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and visual
quality. The code and dataset are available at

                                        <span>Background: Histopathology is an important modality for the diagnosis and
management of many diseases in modern healthcare, and plays a critical role in
cancer care. Pathology samples can be large and require multi-site sampling,
leading to upwards of 20 slides for a single tumor, and the human-expert tasks
of site selection and and quantitative assessment of mitotic figures are time
consuming and subjective. Automating these tasks in the setting of a digital
pathology service presents significant opportunities to improve workflow
efficiency and augment human experts in practice. Approach: Multiple
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for histopathology image
classification and mitotic figure detection were used in the development of
OncoPetNet. Additionally, model-free approaches were used to increase speed and
accuracy. The robust and scalable inference engine leverages Pytorch&#x27;s
performance optimizations as well as specifically developed speed up techniques
in inference. Results: The proposed system, demonstrated significantly improved
mitotic counting performance for 41 cancer cases across 14 cancer types
compared to human expert baselines. In 21.9% of cases use of OncoPetNet led to
change in tumor grading compared to human expert evaluation. In deployment, an
effective 0.27 min/slide inference was achieved in a high throughput veterinary
diagnostic pathology service across 2 centers processing 3,323 digital whole
slide images daily. Conclusion: This work represents the first successful
automated deployment of deep learning systems for real-time expert-level
performance on important histopathology tasks at scale in a high volume
clinical practice. The resulting impact outlines important considerations for
model development, deployment, clinical decision making, and informs best
practices for implementation of deep learning systems in digital histopathology
practices.</span>

                                        <span>The key challenge in learning dense correspondences lies in the lack of
ground-truth matches for real image pairs. While photometric consistency losses
provide unsupervised alternatives, they struggle with large appearance changes,
which are ubiquitous in geometric and semantic matching tasks. Moreover,
methods relying on synthetic training pairs often suffer from poor
generalisation to real data.

We propose Warp Consistency, an unsupervised learning objective for dense
correspondence regression. Our objective is effective even in settings with
large appearance and view-point changes. Given a pair of real images, we first
construct an image triplet by applying a randomly sampled warp to one of the
original images. We derive and analyze all flow-consistency constraints arising
between the triplet. From our observations and empirical results, we design a
general unsupervised objective employing two of the derived constraints. We
validate our warp consistency loss by training three recent dense
correspondence networks for the geometric and semantic matching tasks. Our
approach sets a new state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarks,
including MegaDepth, RobotCar and TSS. Code and models are at

                                        <span>The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely adopted to alleviate
the data scalability issue, while the existing works usually focus on
classifying independently discrete labels. However, in many tasks (e.g.,
medical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The
UDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal
distribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered
set (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the
typically i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior, in this work, a recursively conditional
Gaussian (RCG) set is adapted for ordered constraint modeling, which admits a
tractable joint distribution prior. Furthermore, we are able to control the
density of content vector that violates the poset constraints by a simple
&quot;three-sigma rule&quot;. We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a
shared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate
source/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the
shared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment. Extensive
experiments on UDA medical diagnoses and facial age estimation demonstrate its
effectiveness.</span>

the aim to improve the computational efficiency. It is observed that the most
informative region in each frame of a video is usually a small image patch,
which shifts smoothly across frames. Therefore, we model the patch localization
problem as a sequential decision task, and propose a reinforcement learning
based approach for efficient spatially adaptive video recognition (AdaFocus).

full video sequence, whose features are used by a recurrent policy network to
localize the most task-relevant regions. Then the selected patches are inferred
by a high-capacity network for the final prediction. During offline inference,
once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation
can be done in parallel, and is efficient on modern GPU devices. In addition,
we demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily extended by further
considering the temporal redundancy, e.g., dynamically skipping less valuable
frames. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet,
FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&amp;V2, demonstrate that our method is
significantly more efficient than the competitive baselines. Code is available
at https://github.com/blackfeather-wang/AdaFocus.</span>

                                        <span>Predictor-based algorithms have achieved remarkable performance in the Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) tasks. However, these methods suffer from high
computation costs, as training the performance predictor usually requires
training and evaluating hundreds of architectures from scratch. Previous works
along this line mainly focus on reducing the number of architectures required
to fit the predictor. In this work, we tackle this challenge from a different
perspective - improve search efficiency by cutting down the computation budget
of architecture training. We propose NOn-uniform Successive Halving (NOSH), a
hierarchical scheduling algorithm that terminates the training of
underperforming architectures early to avoid wasting budget. To effectively
leverage the non-uniform supervision signals produced by NOSH, we formulate
predictor-based architecture search as learning to rank with pairwise
comparisons. The resulting method - RANK-NOSH, reduces the search budget by ~5x
while achieving competitive or even better performance than previous
state-of-the-art predictor-based methods on various spaces and datasets.</span>

understanding with new algorithms offering constant improvements of the
detection performance. However, there is little emphasis on experiences and
needs for deployment in embedded environments. We therefore perform a case
study of the deployment of two representative object detection networks on an
edge AI platform. In particular, we consider RetinaNet for image-based 2D
object detection and PointPillars for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. We
describe the modifications necessary to convert the algorithms from a PyTorch
training environment to the deployment environment taking into account the
available tools. We evaluate the runtime of the deployed DNN using two
different libraries, TensorRT and TorchScript. In our experiments, we observe
slight advantages of TensorRT for convolutional layers and TorchScript for
fully connected layers. We also study the trade-off between runtime and
performance, when selecting an optimized setup for deployment, and observe that
quantization significantly reduces the runtime while having only little impact
on the detection performance.</span>

the recent years. Although these methods are reported to outperform the
classical techniques, the performance of the classical methods is not examined
in detail. In this study, we compare classical and learning-based methods by
employing mutual nearest neighbor search with ratio test and optimizing the
ratio test threshold to achieve the best performance on two different
performance metrics. After a fair comparison, the experimental results on
HPatches dataset reveal that the performance gap between classical and
learning-based methods is not that significant. Throughout the experiments, we
demonstrated that SuperGlue is the state-of-the-art technique for the image
matching problem on HPatches dataset. However, if a single parameter, namely
ratio test threshold, is carefully optimized, a well-known traditional method
SIFT performs quite close to SuperGlue and even outperforms in terms of mean
matching accuracy (MMA) under 1 and 2 pixel thresholds. Moreover, a recent
approach, DFM, which only uses pre-trained VGG features as descriptors and
ratio test, is shown to outperform most of the well-trained learning-based
methods. Therefore, we conclude that the parameters of any classical method
should be analyzed carefully before comparing against a learning-based
technique.</span>

                                        <span>A formal autism diagnosis is an inefficient and lengthy process. Families
often have to wait years before receiving a diagnosis for their child; some may
not receive one at all due to this delay. One approach to this problem is to
use digital technologies to detect the presence of behaviors related to autism,
which in aggregate may lead to remote and automated diagnostics. One of the
strongest indicators of autism is stimming, which is a set of repetitive,
self-stimulatory behaviors such as hand flapping, headbanging, and spinning.
Using computer vision to detect hand flapping is especially difficult due to
the sparsity of public training data in this space and excessive shakiness and
motion in such data. Our work demonstrates a novel method that overcomes these
issues: we use hand landmark detection over time as a feature representation
which is then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We achieve a
validation accuracy and F1 Score of about 72% on detecting whether videos from
the Self-Stimulatory Behaviour Dataset (SSBD) contain hand flapping or not. Our
best model also predicts accurately on external videos we recorded of ourselves
outside of the dataset it was trained on. This model uses less than 26,000
parameters, providing promise for fast deployment into ubiquitous and wearable
digital settings for a remote autism diagnosis.</span>

and time-sensitive distinction between blood cells affected by Acute
Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and their healthy counterparts calls for the usage
of machine learning architectures. However, three of the most common models,
VGG, ResNet, and Inception, each come with their own set of flaws with room for
improvement which demands the need for a superior model. ALLNet, the proposed
hybrid convolutional neural network architecture, consists of a combination of
the VGG, ResNet, and Inception models. The ALL Challenge dataset of ISBI 2019
(available here) contains 10,691 images of white blood cells which were used to
train and test the models. 7,272 of the images in the dataset are of cells with
ALL and 3,419 of them are of healthy cells. Of the images, 60% were used to
train the model, 20% were used for the cross-validation set, and 20% were used
for the test set. ALLNet outperformed the VGG, ResNet, and the Inception models
across the board, achieving an accuracy of 92.6567%, a sensitivity of 95.5304%,
a specificity of 85.9155%, an AUC score of 0.966347, and an F1 score of 0.94803

92.0991%, a sensitivity of 96.5446%, a specificity of 82.8035%, an AUC score of
0.959972, and an F1 score of 0.942963. The utilization of ALLNet in the

physically accurate sensor modeling with deep network-based image
representation. Our key enabling observations are that the images captured by
thermal sensors can be factored into slowly changing, scene-independent sensor
non-uniformities (that can be accurately modeled using physics) and a
scene-specific radiance flux (that is well-represented using a deep
network-based regularizer). DeepIR requires neither training data nor periodic
ground-truth calibration with a known black body target--making it well suited
for practical computer vision tasks. We demonstrate the power of going DeepIR
by developing new denoising and super-resolution algorithms that exploit
multiple images of the scene captured with camera jitter. Simulated and real
data experiments demonstrate that DeepIR can perform high-quality
non-uniformity correction with as few as three images, achieving a 10dB PSNR
improvement over competing approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Point completion refers to completing the missing geometries of an object
from incomplete observations. Main-stream methods predict the missing shapes by
decoding a global feature learned from the input point cloud, which often leads
to deficient results in preserving topology consistency and surface details. In
this work, we present ME-PCN, a point completion network that leverages
&#x60;emptiness&#x27; in 3D shape space. Given a single depth scan, previous methods
often encode the occupied partial shapes while ignoring the empty regions (e.g.
holes) in depth maps. In contrast, we argue that these &#x60;emptiness&#x27; clues
indicate shape boundaries that can be used to improve topology representation
and detail granularity on surfaces. Specifically, our ME-PCN encodes both the
occupied point cloud and the neighboring &#x60;empty points&#x27;. It estimates
coarse-grained but complete and reasonable surface points in the first stage,
followed by a refinement stage to produce fine-grained surface details.
Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-PCN presents better qualitative
and quantitative performance against the state-of-the-art. Besides, we further
prove that our &#x60;emptiness&#x27; design is lightweight and easy to embed in existing
methods, which shows consistent effectiveness in improving the CD and EMD
scores.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a talking face generation method that takes an
audio signal as input and a short target video clip as reference, and
synthesizes a photo-realistic video of the target face with natural lip
motions, head poses, and eye blinks that are in-sync with the input audio
signal. We note that the synthetic face attributes include not only explicit
ones such as lip motions that have high correlations with speech, but also
implicit ones such as head poses and eye blinks that have only weak correlation
with the input audio. To model such complicated relationships among different
face attributes with input audio, we propose a FACe Implicit Attribute Learning
Generative Adversarial Network (FACIAL-GAN), which integrates the
phonetics-aware, context-aware, and identity-aware information to synthesize
the 3D face animation with realistic motions of lips, head poses, and eye
blinks. Then, our Rendering-to-Video network takes the rendered face images and
the attention map of eye blinks as input to generate the photo-realistic output
video frames. Experimental results and user studies show our method can
generate realistic talking face videos with not only synchronized lip motions,
but also natural head movements and eye blinks, with better qualities than the
results of state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can pose a major risk for aviation safety, due
to both negligent and malicious use. For this reason, the automated detection
and tracking of UAV is a fundamental task in aerial security systems. Common
technologies for UAV detection include visible-band and thermal infrared
imaging, radio frequency and radar. Recent advances in deep neural networks
(DNNs) for image-based object detection open the possibility to use visual
information for this detection and tracking task. Furthermore, these detection
architectures can be implemented as backbones for visual tracking systems,
thereby enabling persistent tracking of UAV incursions. To date, no
comprehensive performance benchmark exists that applies DNNs to visible-band
imagery for UAV detection and tracking. To this end, three datasets with varied
environmental conditions for UAV detection and tracking, comprising a total of
241 videos (331,486 images), are assessed using four detection architectures
and three tracking frameworks. The best performing detector architecture
obtains an mAP of 98.6% and the best performing tracking framework obtains a
MOTA of 96.3%. Cross-modality evaluation is carried out between visible and
infrared spectrums, achieving a maximal 82.8% mAP on visible images when
training in the infrared modality. These results provide the first public
multi-approach benchmark for state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods and
give insight into which detection and tracking architectures are effective in
the UAV domain.</span>

availability of big data and the power of parallel computational units such as
graphical processing units. The vast majority of deep learning research is
conducted using images as training data, however the biomedical domain is rich
in physiological signals that are used for diagnosis and prediction problems.
It is still an open research question how to best utilize signals to train deep
neural networks.

In this paper we define the term Signal2Image (S2Is) as trainable or
non-trainable prefix modules that convert signals, such as
Electroencephalography (EEG), to image-like representations making them
suitable for training image-based deep neural networks defined as &#x60;base
models&#x27;. We compare the accuracy and time performance of four S2Is (&#x60;signal as
image&#x27;, spectrogram, one and two layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs))
combined with a set of &#x60;base models&#x27; (LeNet, AlexNet, VGGnet, ResNet, DenseNet)
along with the depth-wise and 1D variations of the latter. We also provide
empirical evidence that the one layer CNN S2I performs better in eleven out of
fifteen tested models than non-trainable S2Is for classifying EEG signals and
we present visual comparisons of the outputs of the S2Is.</span>

with the advent of large-scale autonomous driving datasets. However, drastic
performance degradation remains a critical challenge for cross-domain
deployment. In addition, existing 3D domain adaptive detection methods often
assume prior access to the target domain annotations, which is rarely feasible
in the real world. To address this challenge, we study a more realistic
setting, unsupervised 3D domain adaptive detection, which only utilizes source
domain annotations. 1) We first comprehensively investigate the major
underlying factors of the domain gap in 3D detection. Our key insight is that
geometric mismatch is the key factor of domain shift. 2) Then, we propose a
novel and unified framework, Multi-Level Consistency Network (MLC-Net), which
employs a teacher-student paradigm to generate adaptive and reliable
pseudo-targets. MLC-Net exploits point-, instance- and neural statistics-level
consistency to facilitate cross-domain transfer. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLC-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
(including those using additional target domain information) on standard
benchmarks. Notably, our approach is detector-agnostic, which achieves
consistent gains on both single- and two-stage 3D detectors.</span>

camera motion, speed variation, and different activities. To effectively
capture this diverse motion pattern, this paper presents a new temporal
adaptive module ({\bf TAM}) to generate video-specific temporal kernels based
on its own feature map. TAM proposes a unique two-level adaptive modeling
scheme by decoupling the dynamic kernel into a location sensitive importance
map and a location invariant aggregation weight. The importance map is learned
in a local temporal window to capture short-term information, while the
aggregation weight is generated from a global view with a focus on long-term
structure. TAM is a modular block and could be integrated into 2D CNNs to yield
a powerful video architecture (TANet) with a very small extra computational
cost. The extensive experiments on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something
datasets demonstrate that our TAM outperforms other temporal modeling methods
consistently, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance under the similar
complexity. The code is available at \url{

However, they introduce a domain gap that severely hurts real-world
performance. We propose to use self-supervised monocular depth estimation as a
proxy task to bridge this gap and improve sim-to-real unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA). Our Geometric Unsupervised Domain Adaptation method (GUDA)
learns a domain-invariant representation via a multi-task objective combining
synthetic semantic supervision with real-world geometric constraints on videos.
GUDA establishes a new state of the art in UDA for semantic segmentation on
three benchmarks, outperforming methods that use domain adversarial learning,

labels has become a trend for person re-identification (re-ID) algorithms in
domain adaptation. A potential limitation of these clustering-based methods is
that they always tend to introduce noisy labels, which will undoubtedly hamper
the performance of our re-ID system. To handle this limitation, an intuitive
solution is to utilize collaborative training to purify the pseudo label
quality. However, there exists a challenge that the complementarity of two
networks, which inevitably share a high similarity, becomes weakened gradually
as training process goes on; worse still, these approaches typically ignore to
consider the self-discrepancy of intra-class relations. To address this issue,
in this paper, we propose a multiple co-teaching framework for domain adaptive
person re-ID, opening up a promising direction about self-discrepancy problem
under unsupervised condition. On top of that, a mean-teaching mechanism is
leveraged to enlarge the difference and discover more complementary features.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on several large-scale datasets show that
our method achieves competitive performance compared with the
state-of-the-arts.</span>

                                        <span>Existing optical flow methods are erroneous in challenging scenes, such as
fog, rain, and night because the basic optical flow assumptions such as
brightness and gradient constancy are broken. To address this problem, we
present an unsupervised learning approach that fuses gyroscope into optical
flow learning. Specifically, we first convert gyroscope readings into motion
fields named gyro field. Second, we design a self-guided fusion module to fuse
the background motion extracted from the gyro field with the optical flow and
guide the network to focus on motion details. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first deep learning-based framework that fuses gyroscope data and
image content for optical flow learning. To validate our method, we propose a
new dataset that covers regular and challenging scenes. Experiments show that
our method outperforms the state-of-art methods in both regular and challenging
scenes. Code and dataset are available at

                                        <span>Vision-based Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) aims to recognize
unsegmented signs from image streams. Overfitting is one of the most critical
problems in CSLR training, and previous works show that the iterative training
scheme can partially solve this problem while also costing more training time.
In this study, we revisit the iterative training scheme in recent CSLR works
and realize that sufficient training of the feature extractor is critical to
solving the overfitting problem. Therefore, we propose a Visual Alignment
Constraint (VAC) to enhance the feature extractor with alignment supervision.
Specifically, the proposed VAC comprises two auxiliary losses: one focuses on
visual features only, and the other enforces prediction alignment between the
feature extractor and the alignment module. Moreover, we propose two metrics to
reflect overfitting by measuring the prediction inconsistency between the
feature extractor and the alignment module. Experimental results on two
challenging CSLR datasets show that the proposed VAC makes CSLR networks
end-to-end trainable and achieves competitive performance.</span>

Rather than transferring the style of an image as a whole, our goal is to
translate the geometry of an object as depicted in different domains while
preserving its appearance characteristics. Our model is trained in an unpaired
fashion, i.e. without the need of paired images during training. It performs
all steps of the shape transfer within a single model and without additional
post-processing stages. Extensive experiments on the VITON, CMU-Multi-PIE and
our own FashionStyle datasets show the effectiveness of the method. In

                                        <span>Existing research on autonomous driving primarily focuses on urban driving,
which is insufficient for characterising the complex driving behaviour
underlying high-speed racing. At the same time, existing racing simulation
frameworks struggle in capturing realism, with respect to visual rendering,
vehicular dynamics, and task objectives, inhibiting the transfer of learning
agents to real-world contexts. We introduce a new environment, where agents
Learn-to-Race (L2R) in simulated competition-style racing, using multimodal
information--from virtual cameras to a comprehensive array of inertial
measurement sensors. Our environment, which includes a simulator and an
interfacing training framework, accurately models vehicle dynamics and racing
conditions. In this paper, we release the Arrival simulator for autonomous
racing. Next, we propose the L2R task with challenging metrics, inspired by
learning-to-drive challenges, Formula-style racing, and multimodal trajectory
prediction for autonomous driving. Additionally, we provide the L2R framework
suite, facilitating simulated racing on high-precision models of real-world
tracks. Finally, we provide an official L2R task dataset of expert
demonstrations, as well as a series of baseline experiments and reference
implementations. We make all code available:

mask, which poses a huge challenge to deep face recognition. In this workshop,
we organize Masked Face Recognition (MFR) challenge and focus on bench-marking
deep face recognition methods under the existence of facial masks. In the MFR
challenge, there are two main tracks: the InsightFace track and the WebFace260M
track. For the InsightFace track, we manually collect a large-scale masked face
test set with 7K identities. In addition, we also collect a children test set
including 14K identities and a multi-racial test set containing 242K
identities. By using these three test sets, we build up an online model testing
system, which can give a comprehensive evaluation of face recognition models.
To avoid data privacy problems, no test image is released to the public. As the
challenge is still under-going, we will keep on updating the top-ranked
solutions as well as this report on the arxiv.</span>

                                        <span>A long-standing goal in computer vision is to capture, model, and
realistically synthesize human behavior. Specifically, by learning from data,
our goal is to enable virtual humans to navigate within cluttered indoor scenes
and naturally interact with objects. Such embodied behavior has applications in
virtual reality, computer games, and robotics, while synthesized behavior can
be used as a source of training data. This is challenging because real human
motion is diverse and adapts to the scene. For example, a person can sit or lie
on a sofa in many places and with varying styles. It is necessary to model this
diversity when synthesizing virtual humans that realistically perform
human-scene interactions. We present a novel data-driven, stochastic motion
synthesis method that models different styles of performing a given action with
a target object. Our method, called SAMP, for Scene-Aware Motion Prediction,
generalizes to target objects of various geometries while enabling the
character to navigate in cluttered scenes. To train our method, we collected
MoCap data covering various sitting, lying down, walking, and running styles.
We demonstrate our method on complex indoor scenes and achieve superior
performance compared to existing solutions. Our code and data are available for
research at https://samp.is.tue.mpg.de.</span>

estimation. Our contributions are 3 folds. First, unlike previous methods that
regress 4 offsets for a homography, we propose a homography flow
representation, which can be estimated by a weighted sum of 8 pre-defined
homography flow bases. Second, considering a homography contains 8
Degree-of-Freedoms (DOFs) that is much less than the rank of the network
features, we propose a Low Rank Representation (LRR) block that reduces the
feature rank, so that features corresponding to the dominant motions are
retained while others are rejected. Last, we propose a Feature Identity Loss
(FIL) to enforce the learned image feature warp-equivariant, meaning that the
result should be identical if the order of warp operation and feature
extraction is swapped. With this constraint, the unsupervised optimization is
achieved more effectively and more stable features are learned. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly
proposed components, and results show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art on the homography benchmark datasets both qualitatively and
quantitatively. Code is available at

                                        <span>Most of stereo vision works are focusing on computing the dense pixel
disparity of a given pair of left and right images. A camera pair usually
required lens undistortion and stereo calibration to provide an undistorted
epipolar line calibrated image pair for accurate dense pixel disparity
computation. Due to noise, object occlusion, repetitive or lack of texture and
limitation of matching algorithms, the pixel disparity accuracy usually suffers
the most at those object boundary areas. Although statistically the total
number of pixel disparity errors might be low (under 2% according to the Kitti
Vision Benchmark of current top ranking algorithms), the percentage of these
disparity errors at object boundaries are very high. This renders the
subsequence 3D object distance detection with much lower accuracy than desired.
This paper proposed a different approach for solving a 3D object distance
detection by detecting object disparity directly without going through a dense
pixel disparity computation. An example squeezenet Object Disparity-SSD
(OD-SSD) was constructed to demonstrate an efficient object disparity detection
with comparable accuracy compared with Kitti dataset pixel disparity ground
truth. Further training and testing results with mixed image dataset captured
by several different stereo systems may suggest that an OD-SSD might be
agnostic to stereo system parameters such as a baseline, FOV, lens distortion,
even left/right camera epipolar line misalignment.</span>

                                        <span>Domain shift happens in cross-domain scenarios commonly because of the wide
gaps between different domains: when applying a deep learning model
well-trained in one domain to another target domain, the model usually performs
poorly. To tackle this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques
are proposed to bridge the gap between different domains, for the purpose of
improving model performance without annotation in the target domain.
Particularly, UDA has a great value for multimodal medical image analysis,
where annotation difficulty is a practical concern. However, most existing UDA
methods can only achieve satisfactory improvements in one adaptation direction
(e.g., MRI to CT), but often perform poorly in the other (CT to MRI), limiting
their practical usage. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional UDA (BiUDA)
framework based on disentangled representation learning for equally competent
two-way UDA performances. This framework employs a unified domain-aware pattern
encoder which not only can adaptively encode images in different domains
through a domain controller, but also improve model efficiency by eliminating
redundant parameters. Furthermore, to avoid distortion of contents and patterns
of input images during the adaptation process, a content-pattern consistency
loss is introduced. Additionally, for better UDA segmentation performance, a
label consistency strategy is proposed to provide extra supervision by
recomposing target-domain-styled images and corresponding source-domain
annotations. Comparison experiments and ablation studies conducted on two
public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our BiUDA framework to current
state-of-the-art UDA methods and the effectiveness of its novel designs. By
successfully addressing two-way adaptations, our BiUDA framework offers a
flexible solution of UDA techniques to the real-world scenario.</span>

                                        <span>Co-speech gesture generation is to synthesize a gesture sequence that not
only looks real but also matches with the input speech audio. Our method
generates the movements of a complete upper body, including arms, hands, and
the head. Although recent data-driven methods achieve great success, challenges
still exist, such as limited variety, poor fidelity, and lack of objective
metrics. Motivated by the fact that the speech cannot fully determine the
gesture, we design a method that learns a set of gesture template vectors to
model the latent conditions, which relieve the ambiguity. For our method, the
template vector determines the general appearance of a generated gesture
sequence, while the speech audio drives subtle movements of the body, both
indispensable for synthesizing a realistic gesture sequence. Due to the
intractability of an objective metric for gesture-speech synchronization, we
adopt the lip-sync error as a proxy metric to tune and evaluate the
synchronization ability of our model. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our method in both objective and subjective evaluations on
fidelity and synchronization.</span>

                                        <span>Convolution on 3D point clouds that generalized from 2D grid-like domains is
widely researched yet far from perfect. The standard convolution characterises
feature correspondences indistinguishably among 3D points, presenting an
intrinsic limitation of poor distinctive feature learning. In this paper, we
propose Adaptive Graph Convolution (AdaptConv) which generates adaptive kernels
for points according to their dynamically learned features. Compared with using
a fixed/isotropic kernel, AdaptConv improves the flexibility of point cloud
convolutions, effectively and precisely capturing the diverse relations between
points from different semantic parts. Unlike popular attentional weight
schemes, the proposed AdaptConv implements the adaptiveness inside the
convolution operation instead of simply assigning different weights to the
neighboring points. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud classification and
segmentation approaches on several benchmark datasets. Our code is available at

                                        <span>In this paper, we challenge the common assumption that collapsing the spatial
dimensions of a 3D (spatial-channel) tensor in a convolutional neural network
(CNN) into a vector via global pooling removes all spatial information.
Specifically, we demonstrate that positional information is encoded based on
the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely
not. Following this demonstration, we show the real world impact of these
findings by applying them to two applications. First, we propose a simple yet
effective data augmentation strategy and loss function which improves the
translation invariance of a CNN&#x27;s output. Second, we propose a method to
efficiently determine which channels in the latent representation are
responsible for (i) encoding overall position information or (ii)
region-specific positions. We first show that semantic segmentation has a
significant reliance on the overall position channels to make predictions. We
then show for the first time that it is possible to perform a &#x60;region-specific&#x27;
attack, and degrade a network&#x27;s performance in a particular part of the input.
We believe our findings and demonstrated applications will benefit research
areas concerned with understanding the characteristics of CNNs.</span>

measure distances to objects 360-degree around. We have been developing an
omnidirectional stereo camera exploiting two hyperbolic mirrors and a single
set of a lens and sensor, which makes this camera compact and cost efficient.
We establish a new calibration method for this camera considering higher-order
radial distortion, detailed tangential distortion, an image sensor tilt, and a
lens-mirror offset. Our method reduces the calibration error by 6.0 and 4.3
times for the upper- and lower-view images, respectively. The random error of
the distance measurement is 4.9% and the systematic error is 5.7% up to objects
14 meters apart, which is improved almost nine times compared to the
conventional method. The remaining distance errors is due to a degraded optical
resolution of the prototype, which we plan to make further improvements as
future work.</span>

processes instead of putting their workers at risk by making them climb high
voltage power line towers, for instance. A crucial task for the inspection is
to detect and classify assets in the power transmission lines. However, public

this area. This work proposes the Power Line Assets Dataset, containing

transmission tower, insulator, spacer, tower plate, and Stockbridge damper,
which vary in size (resolution), orientation, illumination, angulation, and

arbitrary clothing styles. Our reconstructed avatars are animation-ready and
highly realistic, in both the visible regions from input views and the unseen
regions. While prior work shows great promise of reconstructing animatable
clothed humans with various topologies, we observe that there exist fundamental
limitations resulting in sub-optimal reconstruction quality. In this paper, we
revisit the major steps of image-based avatar reconstruction and address the
limitations with ARCH++. First, we introduce an end-to-end point based geometry
encoder to better describe the semantics of the underlying 3D human body, in
replacement of previous hand-crafted features. Second, in order to address the
occupancy ambiguity caused by topological changes of clothed humans in the
canonical pose, we propose a co-supervising framework with cross-space
consistency to jointly estimate the occupancy in both the posed and canonical
spaces. Last, we use image-to-image translation networks to further refine
detailed geometry and texture on the reconstructed surface, which improves the
fidelity and consistency across arbitrary viewpoints. In the experiments, we
demonstrate improvements over the state of the art on both public benchmarks
and user studies in reconstruction quality and realism.</span>

threat to digital society. Various DeepFake detection methods and datasets are
proposed for detecting such data, especially for face-swapping. However, recent
researches less consider facial animation, which is also important in the
DeepFake attack side. It tries to animate a face image with actions provided by
a driving video, which also leads to a concern about the security of recent
payment systems that reply on liveness detection to authenticate real users via
recognising a sequence of user facial actions. However, our experiments show
that the existed datasets are not sufficient to develop reliable detection
methods. While the current liveness detector cannot defend such videos as the
attack. As a response, we propose a new human face animation dataset, called
DeepFake MNIST+, generated by a SOTA image animation generator. It includes
10,000 facial animation videos in ten different actions, which can spoof the
recent liveness detectors. A baseline detection method and a comprehensive
analysis of the method is also included in this paper. In addition, we analyze
the proposed dataset&#x27;s properties and reveal the difficulty and importance of

                                        <span>The representation of consistent mixed reality (XR) environments requires
adequate real and virtual illumination composition in real-time. Estimating the
lighting of a real scenario is still a challenge. Due to the ill-posed nature
of the problem, classical inverse-rendering techniques tackle the problem for
simple lighting setups. However, those assumptions do not satisfy the current
state-of-art in computer graphics and XR applications. While many recent works
solve the problem using machine learning techniques to estimate the environment
light and scene&#x27;s materials, most of them are limited to geometry or previous
knowledge. This paper presents a CNN-based model to estimate complex lighting
for mixed reality environments with no previous information about the scene. We
model the environment illumination using a set of spherical harmonics (SH)
environment lighting, capable of efficiently represent area lighting. We
propose a new CNN architecture that inputs an RGB image and recognizes, in
real-time, the environment lighting. Unlike previous CNN-based lighting
estimation methods, we propose using a highly optimized deep neural network
architecture, with a reduced number of parameters, that can learn high complex
lighting scenarios from real-world high-dynamic-range (HDR) environment images.
We show in the experiments that the CNN architecture can predict the
environment lighting with an average mean squared error (MSE) of \num{7.85e-04}
when comparing SH lighting coefficients. We validate our model in a variety of
mixed reality scenarios. Furthermore, we present qualitative results comparing
relights of real-world scenes.</span>

                                        <span>Lensless cameras provide a framework to build thin imaging systems by
replacing the lens in a conventional camera with an amplitude or phase mask
near the sensor. Existing methods for lensless imaging can recover the depth
and intensity of the scene, but they require solving computationally-expensive
inverse problems. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to recover dense
scenes with large depth variations. In this paper, we propose a lensless
imaging system that captures a small number of measurements using different
patterns on a programmable mask. In this context, we make three contributions.
First, we present a fast recovery algorithm to recover textures on a fixed
number of depth planes in the scene. Second, we consider the mask design
problem, for programmable lensless cameras, and provide a design template for
optimizing the mask patterns with the goal of improving depth estimation.
Third, we use a refinement network as a post-processing step to identify and
remove artifacts in the reconstruction. These modifications are evaluated
extensively with experimental results on a lensless camera prototype to
showcase the performance benefits of the optimized masks and recovery
algorithms over the state of the art.</span>

                                        <span>An important scenario for image quality assessment (IQA) is to evaluate image
restoration (IR) algorithms. The state-of-the-art approaches adopt a
full-reference paradigm that compares restored images with their corresponding
pristine-quality images. However, pristine-quality images are usually
unavailable in blind image restoration tasks and real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a practical solution named degraded-reference IQA (DR-IQA),
which exploits the inputs of IR models, degraded images, as references.
Specifically, we extract reference information from degraded images by
distilling knowledge from pristine-quality images. The distillation is achieved
through learning a reference space, where various degraded images are
encouraged to share the same feature statistics with pristine-quality images.
And the reference space is optimized to capture deep image priors that are
useful for quality assessment. Note that pristine-quality images are only used
during training. Our work provides a powerful and differentiable metric for
blind IRs, especially for GAN-based methods. Extensive experiments show that
our results can even be close to the performance of full-reference settings.</span>

                                        <span>Deep face recognition (FR) has achieved significantly high accuracy on
several challenging datasets and fosters successful real-world applications,
even showing high robustness to the illumination variation that is usually
regarded as a main threat to the FR system. However, in the real world,
illumination variation caused by diverse lighting conditions cannot be fully
covered by the limited face dataset. In this paper, we study the threat of
lighting against FR from a new angle, i.e., adversarial attack, and identify a
new task, i.e., adversarial relighting. Given a face image, adversarial
relighting aims to produce a naturally relighted counterpart while fooling the
state-of-the-art deep FR methods. To this end, we first propose the physical
model-based adversarial relighting attack (ARA) denoted as
albedo-quotient-based adversarial relighting attack (AQ-ARA). It generates
natural adversarial light under the physical lighting model and guidance of FR
systems and synthesizes adversarially relighted face images. Moreover, we
propose the auto-predictive adversarial relighting attack (AP-ARA) by training
an adversarial relighting network (ARNet) to automatically predict the
adversarial light in a one-step manner according to different input faces,
allowing efficiency-sensitive applications. More importantly, we propose to
transfer the above digital attacks to physical ARA (Phy-ARA) through a precise
relighting device, making the estimated adversarial lighting condition
reproducible in the real world. We validate our methods on three
state-of-the-art deep FR methods, i.e., FaceNet, ArcFace, and CosFace, on two
public datasets. The extensive and insightful results demonstrate our work can
generate realistic adversarial relighted face images fooling FR easily,
revealing the threat of specific light directions and strengths.</span>

human well-being across medical, social work, and legal domains. Labeled
datasets to train supervised deception detection models can rarely be collected
for real-world, high-stakes contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the
first unsupervised approach for detecting real-world, high-stakes deception in
videos without requiring labels. This paper presents our novel approach for
affect-aware unsupervised Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to learn discriminative
representations of deceptive and truthful behavior. Drawing on psychology
theories that link affect and deception, we experimented with unimodal and
multimodal DBN-based approaches trained on facial valence, facial arousal,
audio, and visual features. In addition to using facial affect as a feature on
which DBN models are trained, we also introduce a DBN training procedure that
uses facial affect as an aligner of audio-visual representations. We conducted
classification experiments with unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model clustering
to evaluate our approaches. Our best unsupervised approach (trained on facial
valence and visual features) achieved an AUC of 80%, outperforming human
ability and performing comparably to fully-supervised models. Our results
motivate future work on unsupervised, affect-aware computational approaches for
detecting deception and other social behaviors in the wild.</span>

                                        <span>Existing salient object detection (SOD) models mainly rely on CNN-based
U-shaped structures with skip connections to combine the global contexts and
local spatial details that are crucial for locating salient objects and
refining object details, respectively. Despite great successes, the ability of
CNN in learning global contexts is limited. Recently, the vision transformer
has achieved revolutionary progress in computer vision owing to its powerful
modeling of global dependencies. However, directly applying the transformer to
SOD is obviously suboptimal because the transformer lacks the ability to learn
local spatial representations. To this end, this paper explores the combination
of transformer and CNN to learn both global and local representations for SOD.
We propose a transformer-based Asymmetric Bilateral U-Net (AbiU-Net). The
asymmetric bilateral encoder has a transformer path and a lightweight CNN path,
where the two paths communicate at each encoder stage to learn complementary
global contexts and local spatial details, respectively. The asymmetric
bilateral decoder also consists of two paths to process features from the
transformer and CNN encoder paths, with communication at each decoder stage for
decoding coarse salient object locations and find-grained object details,
respectively. Such communication between the two encoder/decoder paths enables
AbiU-Net to learn complementary global and local representations, taking
advantage of the natural properties of transformer and CNN, respectively.
Hence, ABiU-Net provides a new perspective for transformer-based SOD. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ABiU-Net performs favorably against previous
state-of-the-art SOD methods. The code will be released.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a three-tier modality alignment approach to learning
text-image joint embedding, coined as JEMA, for cross-modal retrieval of
cooking recipes and food images. The first tier improves recipe text embedding
by optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced
sequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the
ResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with
word2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint
embedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin
optimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of
cross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further
reduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific
embedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the
image category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint
embedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the
visual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint
embedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark
dataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and
recipe-to-image retrievals.</span>

Component Analysis (&#x27;FastICA&#x27;) method (&#x27;m-ar-K-FastICA&#x27;) for feature

capture a higher extent of non-linearity in the data; however, reproducible,
open-source kernels to aid with feature extraction are still limited and may
not be reliable when projecting features from entropic data. The m-ar-K
function, freely available in Python and compatible with its open-source

feature extraction in presence of a high extent of randomness in the data,
reducing the need for pre-whitening. Different classification tasks were
considered, as related to five (N &#x3D; 5) open access datasets of various degrees
of information entropy, available from scikit-learn and the University
California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning repository. Experimental results
demonstrate improvements in the classification performance brought by the

particularly challenging for small businesses with limited advertising
experience. When an inexperienced advertiser onboards with a poorly written ad
text, the ad platform has the opportunity to detect low performing ad text, and
provide improvement suggestions. To realize this opportunity, we propose an ad
text strength indicator (TSI) which: (i) predicts the click-through-rate (CTR)
for an input ad text, (ii) fetches similar existing ads to create a
neighborhood around the input ad, (iii) and compares the predicted CTRs in the
neighborhood to declare whether the input ad is strong or weak. In addition, as
suggestions for ad text improvement, TSI shows anonymized versions of superior
ads (higher predicted CTR) in the neighborhood. For (i), we propose a BERT
based text-to-CTR model trained on impressions and clicks associated with an ad
text. For (ii), we propose a sentence-BERT based semantic-ad-similarity model
trained using weak labels from ad campaign setup data. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our BERT based text-to-CTR model achieves a significant lift
in CTR prediction AUC for cold start (new) advertisers compared to bag-of-words
based baselines. In addition, our semantic-textual-similarity model for similar
ads retrieval achieves a precision@1 of 0.93 (for retrieving ads from the same
product category); this is significantly higher compared to unsupervised
TF-IDF, word2vec, and sentence-BERT baselines. Finally, we share promising
online results from advertisers in the Yahoo (Verizon Media) ad platform where
a variant of TSI was implemented with sub-second end-to-end latency.</span>

                                        <span>Attitudinal Network Graphs are signed graphs where edges capture an expressed
opinion; two vertices connected by an edge can be agreeable (positive) or
antagonistic (negative). A signed graph is called balanced if each of its
cycles includes an even number of negative edges. Balance is often
characterized by the frustration index or by finding a single convergent
balanced state of network consensus. In this paper, we propose to expand the
measures of consensus from a single balanced state associated with the
frustration index to the set of nearest balanced states. We introduce the
frustration cloud as a set of all nearest balanced states and use a
graph-balancing algorithm to find all nearest balanced states in a
deterministic way. Computational concerns are addressed by measuring consensus
probabilistically, and we introduce new vertex and edge metrics to quantify
status, agreement, and influence. We also introduce a new global measure of
controversy for a given signed graph and show that vertex status is a zero-sum
game in the signed network. We propose an efficient scalable algorithm for
calculating frustration cloud-based measures in social network and survey data
of up to 80,000 vertices and half-a-million edges. We also demonstrate the
power of the proposed approach to provide discriminant features for community
discovery when compared to spectral clustering and to automatically identify
dominant vertices and anomalous decisions in the network.</span>

number of servers, for given performance guarantees. We consider a system,
where each incoming application is sent to a set of servers, and is considered
to be completed if a subset of them finish serving it. We consider a simple
case when each server core has two speed levels, where the higher speed can be
achieved by higher power for each core independently. The core selects one of
the two speeds probabilistically for each incoming application request. We
model arrival of application requests by a Poisson process, and random service
time at the server with independent exponential random variables. Our model and
analysis generalizes to today&#x27;s state-of-the-art in CPU energy management where
each core can independently select a speed level from a set of supported speeds
and corresponding voltages. The performance metrics under consideration are the
mean number of applications in the system and the average energy expenditure.
We first provide a tight approximation to study this previously intractable
problem and derive closed form approximate expressions for the performance
metrics when service times are exponentially distributed. Next, we study the
trade-off between the approximate mean number of applications and energy
expenditure in terms of the switching probability.</span>

personalized chatbot is designed as a digital chatting assistant for a user.
The key characteristic of a personalized chatbot is that it should have a
consistent personality with the corresponding user. It can talk the same way as
the user when it is delegated to respond to others&#x27; messages. We present a
retrieval-based personalized chatbot model, namely IMPChat, to learn an
implicit user profile from the user&#x27;s dialogue history. We argue that the
implicit user profile is superior to the explicit user profile regarding
accessibility and flexibility. IMPChat aims to learn an implicit user profile
through modeling user&#x27;s personalized language style and personalized
preferences separately. To learn a user&#x27;s personalized language style, we
elaborately build language models from shallow to deep using the user&#x27;s
historical responses; To model a user&#x27;s personalized preferences, we explore
the conditional relations underneath each post-response pair of the user. The
personalized preferences are dynamic and context-aware: we assign higher
weights to those historical pairs that are topically related to the current
query when aggregating the personalized preferences. We match each response
candidate with the personalized language style and personalized preference,
respectively, and fuse the two matching signals to determine the final ranking
score. Comprehensive experiments on two large datasets show that our method
outperforms all baseline models.</span>

been proposed to improve the recommendation accuracy in a target dataset
(domain/system) with the help of a source one with relatively richer
information. However, most existing CDR and CSR approaches are single-target,
namely, there is a single target dataset, which can only help the target
dataset and thus cannot benefit the source dataset. In this paper, we focus on
three new scenarios, i.e., Dual-Target CDR (DTCDR), Multi-Target CDR (MTCDR),
and CDR+CSR, and aim to improve the recommendation accuracy in all datasets
simultaneously for all scenarios. To do this, we propose a unified framework,
called GA (based on Graph embedding and Attention techniques), for all three
scenarios. In GA, we first construct separate heterogeneous graphs to generate
more representative user and item embeddings. Then, we propose an element-wise
attention mechanism to effectively combine the embeddings of common entities
(users/items) learned from different datasets. Moreover, to avoid negative
transfer, we further propose a Personalized training strategy to minimize the
embedding difference of common entities between a richer dataset and a sparser
dataset, deriving three new models, i.e., GA-DTCDR-P, GA-MTCDR-P, and
GA-CDR+CSR-P, for the three scenarios respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed GA models
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

improved performance by leveraging reviews for rating prediction. However,
despite being extensively studied, these methods still suffer from some
limitations. First, previous studies either encode the document or extract
latent sentiment via neural networks, which are difficult to interpret the
sentiment of reviewers intuitively. Second, they neglect the personalized
interaction of reviews with user/item, i.e., each review has different
contributions when modeling the sentiment preference of user/item. To remedy
these issues, we propose a Sentiment-aware Interactive Fusion Network (SIFN)
for review-based item recommendation. Specifically, we first encode user/item
reviews via BERT and propose a light-weighted sentiment learner to extract
semantic features of each review. Then, we propose a sentiment prediction task
that guides the sentiment learner to extract sentiment-aware features via
explicit sentiment labels. Finally, we design a rating prediction task that
contains a rating learner with an interactive and fusion module to fuse the
identity (i.e., user and item ID) and each review representation so that
various interactive features can synergistically influence the final rating
score. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model is superior to state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely adopted to alleviate
the data scalability issue, while the existing works usually focus on
classifying independently discrete labels. However, in many tasks (e.g.,
medical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The
UDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal
distribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered
set (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the
typically i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior, in this work, a recursively conditional
Gaussian (RCG) set is adapted for ordered constraint modeling, which admits a
tractable joint distribution prior. Furthermore, we are able to control the
density of content vector that violates the poset constraints by a simple
&quot;three-sigma rule&quot;. We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a
shared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate
source/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the
shared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment. Extensive
experiments on UDA medical diagnoses and facial age estimation demonstrate its
effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Data augmentation is a widely adopted technique for avoiding overfitting when
training deep neural networks. However, this approach requires domain-specific
knowledge and is often limited to a fixed set of hard-coded transformations.
Recently, several works proposed to use generative models for generating
semantically meaningful perturbations to train a classifier. However, because
accurate encoding and decoding are critical, these methods, which use
architectures that approximate the latent-variable inference, remained limited
to pilot studies on small datasets.

Exploiting the exactly reversible encoder-decoder structure of normalizing
flows, we perform on-manifold perturbations in the latent space to define fully
unsupervised data augmentations. We demonstrate that such perturbations match
the performance of advanced data augmentation techniques -- reaching 96.6% test
accuracy for CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 and outperform existing methods,
particularly in low data regimes -- yielding 10--25% relative improvement of
test accuracy from classical training. We find that our latent adversarial
perturbations adaptive to the classifier throughout its training are most
effective, yielding the first test accuracy improvement results on real-world
datasets -- CIFAR-10/100 -- via latent-space perturbations.</span>

the aim to improve the computational efficiency. It is observed that the most
informative region in each frame of a video is usually a small image patch,
which shifts smoothly across frames. Therefore, we model the patch localization
problem as a sequential decision task, and propose a reinforcement learning
based approach for efficient spatially adaptive video recognition (AdaFocus).
In specific, a light-weighted ConvNet is first adopted to quickly process the
full video sequence, whose features are used by a recurrent policy network to
localize the most task-relevant regions. Then the selected patches are inferred
by a high-capacity network for the final prediction. During offline inference,
once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation
can be done in parallel, and is efficient on modern GPU devices. In addition,
we demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily extended by further
considering the temporal redundancy, e.g., dynamically skipping less valuable
frames. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet,
FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&amp;V2, demonstrate that our method is
significantly more efficient than the competitive baselines. Code is available

                                        <span>Implicit neural networks, a.k.a., deep equilibrium networks, are a class of
implicit-depth learning models where function evaluation is performed by
solving a fixed point equation. They generalize classic feedforward models and
are equivalent to infinite-depth weight-tied feedforward networks. While
implicit models show improved accuracy and significant reduction in memory
consumption, they can suffer from ill-posedness and convergence instability.

This paper provides a new framework to design well-posed and robust implicit
neural networks based upon contraction theory for the non-Euclidean norm
$\ell_\infty$. Our framework includes (i) a novel condition for well-posedness
based on one-sided Lipschitz constants, (ii) an average iteration for computing
fixed-points, and (iii) explicit estimates on input-output Lipschitz constants.
Additionally, we design a training problem with the well-posedness condition
and the average iteration as constraints and, to achieve robust models, with
the input-output Lipschitz constant as a regularizer. Our $\ell_\infty$
well-posedness condition leads to a larger polytopic training search space than
existing conditions and our average iteration enjoys accelerated convergence.
Finally, we perform several numerical experiments for function estimation and
digit classification through the MNIST data set. Our numerical results
demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness of the implicit models with
smaller input-output Lipschitz bounds.</span>

supporting decentralized collaborative learning scenarios. Among existing FL
models, federated logistic regression (FLR) is a widely used statistic model
and has been used in various industries. To ensure data security and user
privacy, FLR leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to protect the exchanged
data among different collaborative parties. However, HE introduces significant
computational overhead (i.e., the cost of data encryption/decryption and
calculation over encrypted data), which eventually becomes the performance
bottleneck of the whole system. In this paper, we propose HAFLO, a GPU-based
solution to improve the performance of FLR. The core idea of HAFLO is to
summarize a set of performance-critical homomorphic operators (HO) used by FLR
and accelerate the execution of these operators through a joint optimization of
storage, IO, and computation. The preliminary results show that our
acceleration on FATE, a popular FL framework, achieves a 49.9$\times$ speedup
for heterogeneous LR and 88.4$\times$ for homogeneous LR.</span>

not known at training time. In order to recognize new categories, the
classifier has to project the input samples of known classes in very compact
and separated regions of the features space for discriminating samples of
unknown classes. Recently proposed Capsule Networks have shown to outperform
alternatives in many fields, particularly in image recognition, however they
have not been fully applied yet to open-set recognition. In capsule networks,
scalar neurons are replaced by capsule vectors or matrices, whose entries
represent different properties of objects. In our proposal, during training,
capsules features of the same known class are encouraged to match a pre-defined
gaussian, one for each class. To this end, we use the variational autoencoder
framework, with a set of gaussian priors as the approximation for the posterior
distribution. In this way, we are able to control the compactness of the
features of the same class around the center of the gaussians, thus controlling
the ability of the classifier in detecting samples from unknown classes. We
conducted several experiments and ablation of our model, obtaining state of the

various applications. Most of the recent approaches for PU classification
assume that the class-prior (the ratio of positive samples) in the training
unlabeled dataset is identical to that of the test data, which does not hold in
many practical cases. In addition, we usually do not know the class-priors of
the training and test data, thus we have no clue on how to train a classifier
without them. To address these problems, we propose a novel PU classification
method based on density ratio estimation. A notable advantage of our proposed
method is that it does not require the class-priors in the training phase;
class-prior shift is incorporated only in the test phase. We theoretically
justify our proposed method and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness.</span>

three drawbacks: their grasp of the details of the original text is often
inaccurate, and the text generated by such models often has repetitions, while
it is difficult to handle words that are beyond the word list. In this paper,
we propose a new architecture that combines reinforcement learning and
adversarial generative networks to enhance the sequence-to-sequence attention
model. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that copies words
directly from the source text, contributing to accurate reproduction of
information without sacrificing the ability of generators to generate new
words. Second, we use both intra-temporal and intra-decoder attention to
penalize summarized content and thus discourage repetition. We apply our model
to our own proposed COVID-19 paper title summarization task and achieve close
approximations to the current model on ROUEG, while bringing better
readability.</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models can synthesize photorealistic images of human faces
with novel identities. However, a key challenge to the wide applicability of
such techniques is to provide independent control over semantically meaningful
parameters: appearance, head pose, face shape, and facial expressions. In this
paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our knowledge the first method that
learns a variational latent feature space of neural face textures, which allows
sampling of novel identities. We combine this generative model with a
parametric face model and gain explicit control over head pose and facial
expressions. To generate complete images of human heads, we propose an additive
decoder that adds plausible details such as hair. A novel training scheme
enforces a pose-independent latent space and in consequence, allows learning a
one-to-many mapping between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions.
The resulting method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel
identities under fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial
expressions. This facilitates a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling
novel identities, changing the head pose, expression transfer, and more. Code
and models are available for research on https://mcbuehler.github.io/VariTex.</span>

                                        <span>Manifold-valued functional data analysis (FDA) recently becomes an active
area of research motivated by the raising availability of trajectories or
longitudinal data observed on non-linear manifolds. The challenges of analyzing
such data come from many aspects, including infinite dimensionality and
nonlinearity, as well as time-domain or phase variability. In this paper, we
study the amplitude part of manifold-valued functions on $\mathbb{S}^2$, which
is invariant to random time warping or re-parameterization. Utilizing the nice
geometry of $\mathbb{S}^2$, we develop a set of efficient and accurate tools
for temporal alignment of functions, geodesic computing, and sample mean
calculation. At the heart of these tools, they rely on gradient descent
algorithms with carefully derived gradients. We show the advantages of these
newly developed tools over its competitors with extensive simulations and real
data and demonstrate the importance of considering the amplitude part of
functions instead of mixing it with phase variability in manifold-valued FDA.</span>

Bigger models and growing datasets mean that decentralization of computation is
important and that the amount of information exchanged is quickly growing.
While compression techniques have been introduced to cope with the latter, none
has considered leveraging the temporal correlations that exist in consecutive
vector updates. An important example is distributed momentum-SGD where temporal
correlation is enhanced by the low-pass-filtering effect of applying momentum.
In this paper we design and analyze compression methods that exploit temporal
correlation in systems both with and without error-feedback. Experiments with
the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed methods offer significant
reduction in the rate of communication at only a negligible increase in
computation complexity. We further analyze the convergence of SGD when
compression is applied with error-feedback. In the literature, convergence
guarantees are developed only for compressors that provide error-bounds
point-wise, i.e., for each input to the compressor. In contrast, many important
codes (e.g. rate-distortion codes) provide error-bounds only in expectation and
thus provide a more general guarantee. In this paper we prove the convergence
of SGD under an expected error assumption by establishing a bound for the
minimum gradient norm.</span>

                                        <span>Principal component analysis (PCA) has achieved great success in unsupervised
learning by identifying covariance correlations among features. If the data
collection fails to capture the covariance information, PCA will not be able to
discover meaningful modes. In particular, PCA will fail the spatial Gaussian
Process (GP) model in the undersampling regime, i.e. the averaged distance of
neighboring anchor points (spatial features) is greater than the correlation
length of GP. Counterintuitively, by drawing the connection between PCA and
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, we can not only attack the undersampling challenge but
also compute in an efficient and decoupled way with the proposed algorithm
called Schr\&quot;odinger PCA. Our algorithm only requires variances of features and
estimated correlation length as input, constructs the corresponding
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, and solves it to obtain the energy eigenstates, which
coincide with principal components. We will also establish the connection of
our algorithm to the model reduction techniques in the partial differential
equation (PDE) community, where the steady-state Schr\&quot;odinger operator is
identified as a second-order approximation to the covariance function.
Numerical experiments are implemented to testify the validity and efficiency of
the proposed algorithm, showing its potential for unsupervised learning tasks
on general graphs and manifolds.</span>

(GANs) lack the ability to exactly replicate the high-frequency components of
natural images. To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training
techniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match).
The key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components
from the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents
the discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency
components. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the
low-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural
images. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the
frequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented
as a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it
penalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the
generators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the
real image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and
F-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and
spatial domain on multiple image benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads,
according to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of
currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID
is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover
the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is
already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the
traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus&#x27;s evolutionary history,
such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods
will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of
viral sequences being collected.

Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the
evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering
sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer
based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our
approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and
scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show
the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of
each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine
development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid
position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of
information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree
with those reported by the USA&#x27;s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), further demonstrating our approach.</span>

Systems has been the subject of significant research. Supervised ML is based
upon learning by example, demanding significant volumes of representative
instances for effective training and the need to re-train the model for every
unseen cyber-attack class. However, retraining the models in-situ renders the
network susceptible to attacks owing to the time-window required to acquire a
sufficient volume of data. Although anomaly detection systems provide a
coarse-grained defence against unseen attacks, these approaches are
significantly less accurate and suffer from high false-positive rates. Here, a
complementary approach referred to as &#x27;One-Shot Learning&#x27;, whereby a limited
number of examples of a new attack-class is used to identify a new attack-class
(out of many) is detailed. The model grants a new cyber-attack classification
without retraining. A Siamese Network is trained to differentiate between
classes based on pairs similarities, rather than features, allowing to identify
new and previously unseen attacks. The performance of a pre-trained model to
classify attack-classes based only on one example is evaluated using three
datasets. Results confirm the adaptability of the model in classifying unseen
attacks and the trade-off between performance and the need for distinctive
class representation.</span>

layers with nonlinear activation functions. There have been several approaches
to make them better (e.g. faster convergence, better convergence limit, etc.).
But the researches lack in more structured ways to test them. We test different
MLP architectures by carrying out the experiments on the age and gender
datasets. We empirically show that by whitening inputs before every linear
layer and adding skip connections, our proposed MLP architecture can result in
better performance. Since the whitening process includes dropouts, it can also
be used to approximate Bayesian inference. We have open sourced our code

                                        <span>Hypothesis Selection is a fundamental distribution learning problem where
given a comparator-class $Q&#x3D;\{q_1,\ldots, q_n\}$ of distributions, and a
sampling access to an unknown target distribution $p$, the goal is to output a
distribution $q$ such that $\mathsf{TV}(p,q)$ is close to $opt$, where $opt &#x3D;
\min_i\{\mathsf{TV}(p,q_i)\}$ and $\mathsf{TV}(\cdot, \cdot)$ denotes the
total-variation distance. Despite the fact that this problem has been studied
since the 19th century, its complexity in terms of basic resources, such as
number of samples and approximation guarantees, remains unsettled (this is
discussed, e.g., in the charming book by Devroye and Lugosi &#x60;00). This is in
stark contrast with other (younger) learning settings, such as PAC learning,
for which these complexities are well understood.

We derive an optimal $2$-approximation learning strategy for the Hypothesis
Selection problem, outputting $q$ such that $\mathsf{TV}(p,q) \leq2 \cdot opt +
\eps$, with a (nearly) optimal sample complexity of~$\tilde O(\log
n/\epsilon^2)$. This is the first algorithm that simultaneously achieves the
best approximation factor and sample complexity: previously, Bousquet, Kane,
and Moran (COLT &#x60;19) gave a learner achieving the optimal $2$-approximation,
but with an exponentially worse sample complexity of $\tilde
O(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^{2.5})$, and Yatracos~(Annals of Statistics &#x60;85) gave a
learner with optimal sample complexity of $O(\log n /\epsilon^2)$ but with a
sub-optimal approximation factor of $3$.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, there has been discussions on the ill-posed nature of
super-resolution that multiple possible reconstructions exist for a given
low-resolution image. Using normalizing flows, SRflow[23] achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual quality by learning the distribution of the output
instead of a deterministic output to one estimate. In this paper, we adapt the
concepts of SRFlow to improve GAN-based super-resolution by properly
implementing the one-to-many property. We modify the generator to estimate a
distribution as a mapping from random noise. We improve the content loss that
hampers the perceptual training objectives. We also propose additional training
techniques to further enhance the perceptual quality of generated images. Using
our proposed methods, we were able to improve the performance of ESRGAN[1] in
x4 perceptual SR and achieve the state-of-the-art LPIPS score in x16 perceptual
extreme SR by applying our methods to RFB-ESRGAN[21].</span>

                                        <span>Due to the over-parameterization nature, neural networks are a powerful tool
for nonlinear function approximation. In order to achieve good generalization
on unseen data, a suitable inductive bias is of great importance for neural
networks. One of the most straightforward ways is to regularize the neural
network with some additional objectives. L2 regularization serves as a standard
regularization for neural networks. Despite its popularity, it essentially
regularizes one dimension of the individual neuron, which is not strong enough
to control the capacity of highly over-parameterized neural networks. Motivated
by this, hyperspherical uniformity is proposed as a novel family of relational
regularizations that impact the interaction among neurons. We consider several
geometrically distinct ways to achieve hyperspherical uniformity. The
effectiveness of hyperspherical uniformity is justified by theoretical insights
and empirical evaluations.</span>

DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a
wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to
underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report
provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation
models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,
reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model
architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,
theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal
impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and
ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep
learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent
capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes
homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,
as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models
downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,
we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and
what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these
questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will
require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their
fundamentally sociotechnical nature.</span>

                                        <span>Model inversion (MI) attacks are aimed at reconstructing training data from
model parameters. Such attacks have triggered increasing concerns about
privacy, especially given a growing number of online model repositories.
However, existing MI attacks against deep neural networks (DNNs) have large
room for performance improvement. We present a novel inversion-specific GAN
that can better distill knowledge useful for performing attacks on private
models from public data. In particular, we train the discriminator to
differentiate not only the real and fake samples but the soft-labels provided
by the target model. Moreover, unlike previous work that directly searches for
a single data point to represent a target class, we propose to model a private
data distribution for each target class. Our experiments show that the
combination of these techniques can significantly boost the success rate of the
state-of-the-art MI attacks by 150%, and generalize better to a variety of
datasets and models. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Solving geometric tasks involving point clouds by using machine learning is a
challenging problem. Standard feed-forward neural networks combine linear or,
if the bias parameter is included, affine layers and activation functions.
Their geometric modeling is limited, which motivated the prior work introducing
the multilayer hypersphere perceptron (MLHP). Its constituent part, i.e., the
hypersphere neuron, is obtained by applying a conformal embedding of Euclidean
space. By virtue of Clifford algebra, it can be implemented as the Cartesian
dot product of inputs and weights. If the embedding is applied in a manner
consistent with the dimensionality of the input space geometry, the decision
surfaces of the model units become combinations of hyperspheres and make the
decision-making process geometrically interpretable for humans. Our extension
of the MLHP model, the multilayer geometric perceptron (MLGP), and its
respective layer units, i.e., geometric neurons, are consistent with the 3D
geometry and provide a geometric handle of the learned coefficients. In
particular, the geometric neuron activations are isometric in 3D, which is
necessary for rotation and translation equivariance. When classifying the 3D
Tetris shapes, we quantitatively show that our model requires no activation
function in the hidden layers other than the embedding to outperform the
vanilla multilayer perceptron. In the presence of noise in the data, our model
is also superior to the MLHP.</span>

                                        <span>In many practical data mining scenarios, such as network intrusion detection,
Twitter spam detection, and computer-aided diagnosis, a source domain that is
different from but related to a target domain is very common. In addition, a
large amount of unlabeled data is available in both source and target domains,
but labeling each of them is difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and sometime
unnecessary. Therefore, it is very important and worthwhile to fully explore
the labeled and unlabeled data in source and target domains to settle the task
in target domain. In this paper, a new semi-supervised inductive transfer
learning framework, named \emph{Co-Transfer} is proposed. Co-Transfer first
generates three TrAdaBoost classifiers for transfer learning from the source
domain to the target domain, and meanwhile another three TrAdaBoost classifiers
are generated for transfer learning from the target domain to the source
domain, using bootstraped samples from the original labeled data. In each round
of co-transfer, each group of TrAdaBoost classifiers are refined using the
carefully labeled data. Finally, the group of TrAdaBoost classifiers learned to
transfer from the source domain to the target domain produce the final
hypothesis. Experiments results illustrate Co-Transfer can effectively exploit
and reuse the labeled and unlabeled data in source and target domains.</span>

challenging problems in technology driven industries, such as, the online
retail industry. To address this challenge, change management has emerged as a
promising sub-field in operations that manages and reviews the changes to be
deployed in production in a systematic manner. However, it is practically
impossible to manually review a large number of changes on a daily basis and
assess the risk associated with them. This warrants the development of an
automated system to assess the risk associated with a large number of changes.
There are a few commercial solutions available to address this problem but
those solutions lack the ability to incorporate domain knowledge and continuous
feedback from domain experts into the risk assessment process. As part of this
work, we aim to bridge the gap between model-driven risk assessment of change
requests and the assessment of domain experts by building a continuous feedback
loop into the risk assessment process. Here we present our work to build an
end-to-end machine learning system along with the discussion of some of
practical challenges we faced related to extreme skewness in class
distribution, concept drift, estimation of the uncertainty associated with the
model&#x27;s prediction and the overall scalability of the system.</span>

labels show that the networks first fit the correctly-labeled training samples
before memorizing the mislabeled samples. Motivated by this early-learning
phenomenon, we propose a novel method to prevent memorization of the mislabeled
samples. Unlike the existing approaches which use the model output to identify
or ignore the mislabeled samples, we introduce an indicator branch to the
original model and enable the model to produce a confidence value for each
sample. The confidence values are incorporated in our loss function which is
learned to assign large confidence values to correctly-labeled samples and
small confidence values to mislabeled samples. We also propose an auxiliary
regularization term to further improve the robustness of the model. To improve
the performance, we gradually correct the noisy labels with a well-designed
target estimation strategy. We provide the theoretical analysis and conduct the
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our
approach achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

network involving multiple clients. Each client has its own sample population
which may not be shared with other clients due to privacy concerns. The goal is
to learn a model for each client, which behaves better than the one learned
from its own data, through secure collaborations with other clients in the
network. Due to the discrepancies of the sample distributions across different
clients, it is not necessarily that collaborating with everyone will lead to
the best local models. We propose a learning to collaborate framework, where
each client can choose to collaborate with certain members in the network to
achieve a &quot;collaboration equilibrium&quot;, where smaller collaboration coalitions
are formed within the network so that each client can obtain the model with the
best utility. We propose the concept of benefit graph which describes how each
client can benefit from collaborating with other clients and develop a Pareto
optimization approach to obtain it. Finally the collaboration coalitions can be
derived from it based on graph operations. Our framework provides a new way of
setting up collaborations in a research network. Experiments on both synthetic
and real world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.</span>

observing noisy versions of a remote source facilitate the computation of a
function of their observations at a fusion center through public communication.
The distributed function computation is subject to constraints, including not
only reliability and storage but also privacy and secrecy. Specifically, 1) the
remote source should remain private from an eavesdropper and the fusion center,
measured in terms of the information leaked about the remote source; 2) the
function computed should remain secret from the eavesdropper, measured in terms
of the information leaked about the arguments of the function, to ensure
secrecy regardless of the exact function used. We derive the exact rate regions
for lossless and lossy single-function computation and illustrate the lossy
single-function computation rate region for an information bottleneck example,
in which the optimal auxiliary random variables are characterized for
binary-input symmetric-output channels. We extend the approach to lossless and
lossy asynchronous multiple-function computations with joint secrecy and

of oxygen and nutrients to the surrounding cells. Various diseases have been
shown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of
erythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have
been assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a standard
20-second long microvascular video takes on average 20 minutes and requires
extensive training. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders
the application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this
paper, we present a fully automated state-of-the-art system, called
CapillaryNet, that can quantify skin nutritive capillary density and red blood
cell velocity from handheld microscopy videos. Moreover, CapillaryNet measures
several novel microvascular parameters that researchers were previously unable
to quantify, i.e. capillary hematocrit and Intra-capillary flow velocity
heterogeneity. Our system has been used to analyze skin microcirculation videos
from various patient groups (COVID-19, pancreatitis, and acute heart diseases).
Our proposed system excels from existing capillary detection systems as it
combines the speed of traditional computer vision algorithms and the accuracy
of convolutional neural networks.</span>

been proposed to improve the recommendation accuracy in a target dataset
(domain/system) with the help of a source one with relatively richer
information. However, most existing CDR and CSR approaches are single-target,
namely, there is a single target dataset, which can only help the target
dataset and thus cannot benefit the source dataset. In this paper, we focus on
three new scenarios, i.e., Dual-Target CDR (DTCDR), Multi-Target CDR (MTCDR),
and CDR+CSR, and aim to improve the recommendation accuracy in all datasets
simultaneously for all scenarios. To do this, we propose a unified framework,
called GA (based on Graph embedding and Attention techniques), for all three
scenarios. In GA, we first construct separate heterogeneous graphs to generate
more representative user and item embeddings. Then, we propose an element-wise
attention mechanism to effectively combine the embeddings of common entities
(users/items) learned from different datasets. Moreover, to avoid negative
transfer, we further propose a Personalized training strategy to minimize the
embedding difference of common entities between a richer dataset and a sparser
dataset, deriving three new models, i.e., GA-DTCDR-P, GA-MTCDR-P, and
GA-CDR+CSR-P, for the three scenarios respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed GA models
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

Among various such mobile billboards, taxicab rooftop devices are emerging in
the market as a brand new media. Motov is a leading company in South Korea in
the taxicab rooftop advertising market. In this work, we present a lightweight
yet accurate deep learning-based method to predict taxicabs&#x27; next locations to
better prepare for targeted advertising based on demographic information of
locations. Considering the fact that next POI recommendation datasets are
frequently sparse, we design our presented model based on neural ordinary
differential equations (NODEs), which are known to be robust to
sparse/incorrect input, with several enhancements. Our model, which we call
LightMove, has a larger prediction accuracy, a smaller number of parameters,
and/or a smaller training/inference time, when evaluating with various
datasets, in comparison with state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can pose a major risk for aviation safety, due
to both negligent and malicious use. For this reason, the automated detection
and tracking of UAV is a fundamental task in aerial security systems. Common
technologies for UAV detection include visible-band and thermal infrared
imaging, radio frequency and radar. Recent advances in deep neural networks
(DNNs) for image-based object detection open the possibility to use visual
information for this detection and tracking task. Furthermore, these detection
architectures can be implemented as backbones for visual tracking systems,
thereby enabling persistent tracking of UAV incursions. To date, no
comprehensive performance benchmark exists that applies DNNs to visible-band
imagery for UAV detection and tracking. To this end, three datasets with varied
environmental conditions for UAV detection and tracking, comprising a total of
241 videos (331,486 images), are assessed using four detection architectures
and three tracking frameworks. The best performing detector architecture
obtains an mAP of 98.6% and the best performing tracking framework obtains a
MOTA of 96.3%. Cross-modality evaluation is carried out between visible and
infrared spectrums, achieving a maximal 82.8% mAP on visible images when
training in the infrared modality. These results provide the first public
multi-approach benchmark for state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods and
give insight into which detection and tracking architectures are effective in
the UAV domain.</span>

                                        <span>We present an experimental investigation into the effectiveness of transfer
learning and bottleneck feature extraction in detecting COVID-19 from audio
recordings of cough, breath and speech.

This type of screening is non-contact, does not require specialist medical
expertise or laboratory facilities and can be deployed on inexpensive consumer
hardware.

We use datasets that contain recordings of coughing, sneezing, speech and
other noises, but do not contain COVID-19 labels, to pre-train three deep
neural networks: a CNN, an LSTM and a Resnet50.

These pre-trained networks are subsequently either fine-tuned using smaller
datasets of coughing with COVID-19 labels in the process of transfer learning,
or are used as bottleneck feature extractors.

Results show that a Resnet50 classifier trained by this transfer learning
process delivers optimal or near-optimal performance across all datasets
achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98,
0.94 and 0.92 respectively for all three sound classes (coughs, breaths and
speech).

This indicates that coughs carry the strongest COVID-19 signature, followed
by breath and speech.

Our results also show that applying transfer learning and extracting
bottleneck features using the larger datasets without COVID-19 labels led not
only to improve performance, but also to minimise the standard deviation of the
classifier AUCs among the outer folds of the leave-$p$-out cross-validation,
indicating better generalisation.

We conclude that deep transfer learning and bottleneck feature extraction can
improve COVID-19 cough, breath and speech audio classification, yielding
automatic classifiers with higher accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, there has been an increasing number of efforts to introduce models
capable of generating natural language explanations (NLEs) for their
predictions on vision-language (VL) tasks. Such models are appealing, because
they can provide human-friendly and comprehensive explanations. However, there
is a lack of comparison between existing methods, which is due to a lack of
re-usable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. In this work, we
introduce e-ViL and e-SNLI-VE. e-ViL is a benchmark for explainable
vision-language tasks that establishes a unified evaluation framework and
provides the first comprehensive comparison of existing approaches that
generate NLEs for VL tasks. It spans four models and three datasets and both
automatic metrics and human evaluation are used to assess model-generated
explanations. e-SNLI-VE is currently the largest existing VL dataset with NLEs
(over 430k instances). We also propose a new model that combines UNITER, which
learns joint embeddings of images and text, and GPT-2, a pre-trained language
model that is well-suited for text generation. It surpasses the previous state
of the art by a large margin across all datasets. Code and data are available

                                        <span>Learning from noisy labels is an important concern because of the lack of
accurate ground-truth labels in plenty of real-world scenarios. In practice,
various approaches for this concern first make some corrections corresponding
to potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update predictive model with
information of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as
medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often
difficult or even impossible for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free
ground-truth labels which leads to labels with complex noise. This situation
raises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making
corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has
limitations due to the complex noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate
evaluation strategy for validation/testing is unclear because of the great
difficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels. In this paper, we
focus on alleviating these two problems. For the problem 1), we present
one-step abductive multi-target learning (OSAMTL) that imposes a one-step
logical reasoning upon machine learning via a multi-target learning procedure
to constrain the predictions of the learning model to be subject to our prior
knowledge about the true target. For the problem 2), we propose a logical
assessment formula (LAF) that evaluates the logical rationality of the outputs
of an approach by estimating the consistencies between the predictions of the
learning model and the logical facts narrated from the results of the one-step
logical reasoning of OSAMTL. Applying OSAMTL and LAF to the Helicobacter pylori
(H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL is able to enable
the machine learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which
is beyond various state-of-the-art approaches in handling complex noisy labels.</span>

learning / artificial intelligence method called boosted decision trees (BDT)
on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The firmware implementation of binary
classification requiring 100 training trees with a maximum depth of 4 using
four input variables gives a latency value of about 10 ns, independent of the
clock speed from 100 to 320 MHz in our setup. The low timing values are
achieved by restructuring the BDT layout and reconfiguring its parameters. The
FPGA resource utilization is also kept low at a range from 0.01% to 0.2% in our
setup. A software package called fwXmachina achieves this implementation. Our
intended user is an expert of custom electronics-based trigger systems in high
energy physics experiments or anyone that needs decisions at the lowest latency
values for real-time event classification. Two problems from high energy
physics are considered, in the separation of electrons vs. photons and in the

                                        <span>The abundance of data collected by sensors in Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, and the success of deep neural networks in uncovering hidden patterns
in time series data have led to mounting privacy concerns. This is because
private and sensitive information can be potentially learned from sensor data
by applications that have access to this data. In this paper, we aim to examine
the tradeoff between utility and privacy loss by learning low-dimensional
representations that are useful for data obfuscation. We propose deterministic
and probabilistic transformations in the latent space of a variational
autoencoder to synthesize time series data such that intrusive inferences are
prevented while desired inferences can still be made with sufficient accuracy.
In the deterministic case, we use a linear transformation to move the
representation of input data in the latent space such that the reconstructed
data is likely to have the same public attribute but a different private
attribute than the original input data. In the probabilistic case, we apply the
linear transformation to the latent representation of input data with some
probability. We compare our technique with autoencoder-based anonymization
techniques and additionally show that it can anonymize data in real time on
resource-constrained edge devices.</span>

fail in a new/perturbed environment due to the existence of dynamic variations.
Existing robust methods try to obtain a fixed policy for all envisioned dynamic
variation scenarios through robust or adversarial training. These methods could
lead to conservative performance due to emphasis on the worst case, and often
involve tedious modifications to the training environment. We propose an
approach to robustifying a pre-trained non-robust RL policy with
$\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control. Leveraging the capability of an
$\mathcal{L}_1$ control law in the fast estimation of and active compensation
for dynamic variations, our approach can significantly improve the robustness
of an RL policy trained in a standard (i.e., non-robust) way, either in a
simulator or in the real world. Numerical experiments are provided to validate
the efficacy of the proposed approach.</span>

machine learning researchers in detection of depression. Datasets such as
Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) have been created
to aid research in this area. However, on top of the challenges inherent in
accurately detecting depression, biases in datasets may result in skewed

RGB image as input. The main insight is that simply shrink-wrapping a planar
mesh sheet onto the input image, consistent with the learned intermediate
depth, captures underlying geometry sufficient to generate photorealistic
unseen views with large viewpoint changes. To operationalize this, we propose a
novel differentiable texture sampler that allows our wrapped mesh sheet to be
textured and rendered differentiably into an image from a target viewpoint. Our
approach is category-agnostic, end-to-end trainable without using any 3D
supervision, and requires a single image at test time. We also explore a simple
extension by stacking multiple layers of Worldsheets to better handle
occlusions. Worldsheet consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods
on single-image view synthesis across several datasets. Furthermore, this
simple idea captures novel views surprisingly well on a wide range of
high-resolution in-the-wild images, converting them into navigable 3D pop-ups.

                                        <span>In order to meet the requirements for performance, safety, and latency in
many IoT applications, intelligent decisions must be made right here right now
at the network edge. However, the constrained resources and limited local data
amount pose significant challenges to the development of edge AI. To overcome
these challenges, we explore continual edge learning capable of leveraging the
knowledge transfer from previous tasks. Aiming to achieve fast and continual
edge learning, we propose a platform-aided federated meta-learning architecture
where edge nodes collaboratively learn a meta-model, aided by the knowledge
transfer from prior tasks. The edge learning problem is cast as a regularized
optimization problem, where the valuable knowledge learned from previous tasks
is extracted as regularization. Then, we devise an ADMM based federated
meta-learning algorithm, namely ADMM-FedMeta, where ADMM offers a natural
mechanism to decompose the original problem into many subproblems which can be
solved in parallel across edge nodes and the platform. Further, a variant of
inexact-ADMM method is employed where the subproblems are &#x60;solved&#x27; via linear
approximation as well as Hessian estimation to reduce the computational cost
per round to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. We provide a comprehensive analysis of
ADMM-FedMeta, in terms of the convergence properties, the rapid adaptation
performance, and the forgetting effect of prior knowledge transfer, for the
general non-convex case. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of ADMM-FedMeta, and showcase that it
substantially outperforms the existing baselines.</span>

accurate and timely information on current and future vehicle flows can
successfully increase the quality and availability of transportation services.
This need is aggravated during the current pandemic crisis, which pushes
policymakers and private citizens to seek social-distancing compliant urban
mobility services, such as electric bikes and scooter sharing offerings.
However, predicting the number of incoming and outgoing vehicles for different
city areas is challenging due to the nonlinear spatial and temporal
dependencies typical of urban mobility patterns. In this work, we propose
STREED-Net, a novel deep learning network with a multi-attention (spatial and

to process information in a local neighbourhood with fixed-weight kernels and
aggregate global context hierarchically. However, non-local neural networks and
self-attention for 2D vision have shown that explicitly modeling long-range
interactions can lead to more robust and competitive models. In this paper, we
propose two variants of self-attention for contextual modeling in 3D object
detection by augmenting convolutional features with self-attention features. We
first incorporate the pairwise self-attention mechanism into the current
state-of-the-art BEV, voxel and point-based detectors and show consistent
improvement over strong baseline models of up to 1.5 3D AP while simultaneously
reducing their parameter footprint and computational cost by 15-80% and 30-50%,
respectively, on the KITTI validation set. We next propose a self-attention
variant that samples a subset of the most representative features by learning
deformations over randomly sampled locations. This not only allows us to scale
explicit global contextual modeling to larger point-clouds, but also leads to
more discriminative and informative feature descriptors. Our method can be
flexibly applied to most state-of-the-art detectors with increased accuracy and
parameter and compute efficiency. We show our proposed method improves 3D
object detection performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets. Code

                                        <span>In the regret-based formulation of Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems, except
in rare instances, much of the literature focuses on arms with i.i.d. rewards.
In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB
problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain which may not
belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve logarithmic regret
in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler
Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained
from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a
special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that
works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or
i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies
whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total
variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a
standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the
arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and
Markovian settings.</span>

designed bicycle models sourced from hundreds of designers. We expect BIKED to
enable a variety of data-driven design applications for bicycles and support
the development of data-driven design methods. The dataset is comprised of a
variety of design information including assembly images, component images,
numerical design parameters, and class labels. In this paper, we first discuss
the processing of the dataset, then highlight some prominent research questions
that BIKED can help address. Of these questions, we further explore the
following in detail: 1) Are there prominent gaps in the current bicycle market
and design space? We explore the design space using unsupervised dimensionality
reduction methods. 2) How does one identify the class of a bicycle and what
factors play a key role in defining it? We address the bicycle classification
task by training a multitude of classifiers using different forms of design
data and identifying parameters of particular significance through
permutation-based interpretability analysis. 3) How does one synthesize new
bicycles using different representation methods? We consider numerous machine
learning methods to generate new bicycle models as well as interpolate between
and extrapolate from existing models using Variational Autoencoders. The

train a neural network model, e.g. to detect copyright abuses. We show that
models with higher dimensional input and output are more vulnerable to MIA, and
address in more detail models for image translation and semantic segmentation,
including medical image segmentation. We show that reconstruction-errors can
lead to very effective MIA attacks as they are indicative of memorization.
Unfortunately, reconstruction error alone is less effective at discriminating
between non-predictable images used in training and easy to predict images that
were never seen before. To overcome this, we propose using a novel
predictability error that can be computed for each sample, and its computation
does not require a training set. Our membership error, obtained by subtracting
the predictability error from the reconstruction error, is shown to achieve
high MIA accuracy on an extensive number of benchmarks.</span>

Recent knowledge tracing methods tend to respond to these challenges by
modelling knowledge state dynamics across learning concepts. However, they
still suffer from several inherent challenges including: modelling forgetting
behaviours and identifying relationships among latent concepts. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model,
namely \emph{Deep Graph Memory Network} (DGMN). In this model, we incorporate a
forget gating mechanism into an attention memory structure in order to capture
forgetting behaviours dynamically during the knowledge tracing process.
Particularly, this forget gating mechanism is built upon attention forgetting
features over latent concepts considering their mutual dependencies. Further,
this model has the capability of learning relationships between latent concepts
from a dynamic latent concept graph in light of a student&#x27;s evolving knowledge
states. A comprehensive experimental evaluation has been conducted using four
well-established benchmark datasets. The results show that DGMN consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art KT models over all the datasets. The
effectiveness of modelling forgetting behaviours and learning latent concept
graphs has also been analyzed in our experiments.</span>

learning task by sharing the computational load over multiple nodes in a
network. Here, we investigate the performance of distributed learning for
large-scale linear regression where the model parameters, i.e., the unknowns,
are distributed over the network. We adopt a statistical learning approach. In
contrast to works that focus on the performance on the training data, we focus
on the generalization error, i.e., the performance on unseen data. We provide
high-probability bounds on the generalization error for both isotropic and
correlated Gaussian data as well as sub-gaussian data. These results reveal the
dependence of the generalization performance on the partitioning of the model
over the network. In particular, our results show that the generalization error
of the distributed solution can be substantially higher than that of the
centralized solution even when the error on the training data is at the same
level for both the centralized and distributed approaches. Our numerical
results illustrate the performance with both real-world image data as well as

data, from images and more recently tabular data, under the assumption of
directly accessible training data. Recently, federated learning (FL) is an
emerging paradigm that features decentralized learning on client&#x27;s local data
with a privacy-preserving capability. And, while learning GANs to synthesize
images on FL systems has just been demonstrated, it is unknown if GANs for
tabular data can be learned from decentralized data sources. Moreover, it
remains unclear which distributed architecture suits them best. Different from
image GANs, state-of-the-art tabular GANs require prior knowledge on the data
distribution of each (discrete and continuous) column to agree on a common
encoding -- risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose Fed-TGAN, the
first Federated learning framework for Tabular GANs. To effectively learn a
complex tabular GAN on non-identical participants, Fed-TGAN designs two novel
features: (i) a privacy-preserving multi-source feature encoding for model
initialization; and (ii) table similarity aware weighting strategies to
aggregate local models for countering data skew. We extensively evaluate the
proposed Fed-TGAN against variants of decentralized learning architectures on
four widely used datasets. Results show that Fed-TGAN accelerates training time
per epoch up to 200% compared to the alternative architectures, for both IID
and Non-IID data. Overall, Fed-TGAN not only stabilizes the training loss, but
also achieves better similarity between generated and original data.</span>

pipelines in an eco-system, such as collecting data for possible machine

we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in

and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in
machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data
collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also
investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning

                                        <span>In this paper we combine the k-means and/or k-means type algorithms with a
hill climbing algorithm in stages to solve the joint stratification and sample
allocation problem. This is a combinatorial optimisation problem in which we
search for the optimal stratification from the set of all possible
stratifications of basic strata. Each stratification being a solution the
quality of which is measured by its cost. This problem is intractable for
larger sets. Furthermore evaluating the cost of each solution is expensive. A
number of heuristic algorithms have already been developed to solve this
problem with the aim of finding acceptable solutions in reasonable computation
times. However, the heuristics for these algorithms need to be trained in order
to optimise performance in each instance. We compare the above multi-stage
combination of algorithms with three recent algorithms and report the solution
costs, evaluation times and training times. The multi-stage combinations
generally compare well with the recent algorithms both in the case of atomic
and continuous strata and provide the survey designer with a greater choice of
algorithms to choose from.</span>

                                        <span>The utilization of millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands in 5G networks poses new
challenges to network planning. Vulnerability to blockages at mmWave bands can
cause coverage holes (CHs) in the radio environment, leading to radio link
failure when a user enters these CHs. Detection of the CHs carries critical
importance so that necessary remedies can be introduced to improve coverage. In
this letter, we propose a novel approach to identify the CHs in an unsupervised
fashion using a state-of-the-art manifold learning technique: uniform manifold
approximation and projection. The key idea is to preserve the
local-connectedness structure inherent in the collected unlabelled channel
samples, such that the CHs from the service area are detectable. Our results on
the DeepMIMO dataset scenario demonstrate that the proposed method can learn
the structure within the data samples and provide visual holes in the
low-dimensional embedding while preserving the CH boundaries. Once the CH
boundary is determined in the low-dimensional embedding, channel-based
localization techniques can be applied to these samples to obtain the
geographical boundaries of the CHs.</span>

                                        <span>Causal inference in longitudinal observational health data often requires the
accurate estimation of treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes in the
presence of time-varying covariates. To tackle this sequential treatment effect
estimation problem, we have developed a causal dynamic survival (CDS) model
that uses the potential outcomes framework with the recurrent sub-networks with
random seed ensembles to estimate the difference in survival curves of its
confidence interval. Using simulated survival datasets, the CDS model has shown
good causal effect estimation performance across scenarios of sample dimension,
event rate, confounding and overlapping. However, increasing the sample size is
not effective to alleviate the adverse impact from high level of confounding.
In two large clinical cohort studies, our model identified the expected
conditional average treatment effect and detected individual effect
heterogeneity over time and patient subgroups. CDS provides individualised
absolute treatment effect estimations to improve clinical decisions.</span>

                                        <span>Benford&#x27;s Law (BL) or the Significant Digit Law defines the probability
distribution of the first digit of numerical values in a data sample. This Law
is observed in many naturally occurring datasets. It can be seen as a measure
of naturalness of a given distribution and finds its application in areas like
anomaly and fraud detection. In this work, we address the following question:
Is the distribution of the Neural Network parameters related to the network&#x27;s
generalization capability? To that end, we first define a metric, MLH (Model
Enthalpy),that measures the closeness of a set of numbers to Benford&#x27;s Law and
we show empirically that it is a strong predictor of Validation Accuracy.
Second, we use MLH as an alternative to Validation Accuracy for Early Stopping,
removing the need for a Validation set. We provide experimental evidence that
even if the optimal size of the validation set is known before-hand, the peak
test accuracy attained is lower than not using a validation set at all.
Finally, we investigate the connection of BL to Free Energy Principle and First
Law of Thermodynamics, showing that MLH is a component of the internal energy
of the learning system and optimization as an analogy to minimizing the total
energy to attain equilibrium.</span>

code commits to give early warnings about potential security risks. However,
there is a lack of effort to assess vulnerability-contributing commits right
after they are detected to provide timely information about the exploitability,
impact and severity of SVs. Such information is important to plan and
prioritize the mitigation for the identified SVs. We propose a novel Deep
multi-task learning model, DeepCVA, to automate seven Commit-level
Vulnerability Assessment tasks simultaneously based on Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) metrics. We conduct large-scale experiments on 1,229
vulnerability-contributing commits containing 542 different SVs in 246
real-world software projects to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
our model. We show that DeepCVA is the best-performing model with 38% to 59.8%
higher Matthews Correlation Coefficient than many supervised and unsupervised
baseline models. DeepCVA also requires 6.3 times less training and validation
time than seven cumulative assessment models, leading to significantly less
model maintenance cost as well. Overall, DeepCVA presents the first effective
and efficient solution to automatically assess SVs early in software systems.</span>

in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space are studied for nonstationary time
series. The online prediction algorithms as usual consist of the selection of
kernel structure parameters and the kernel weight vector updating. For
structure parameters, the kernel dictionary is selected by some sparsification
techniques with online selective modeling criteria, and moreover the kernel
covariance matrix is intermittently optimized in the light of the covariance
matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Optimizing the real symmetric
covariance matrix can not only improve the kernel structure&#x27;s flexibility by
the cross relatedness of the input variables, but also partly alleviate the
prediction uncertainty caused by the kernel dictionary selection for
nonstationary time series. In order to sufficiently capture the underlying
dynamic characteristics in prediction-error time series, a generalized
optimization strategy is designed to construct the kernel dictionary
sequentially in multiple kernel connection modes. The generalized optimization
strategy provides a more self-contained way to construct the entire kernel
connections, which enhances the ability to adaptively track the changing
dynamic characteristics. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that the
proposed approach has superior prediction performance for nonstationary time
series.</span>

                                        <span>Higher-order tensors have received increased attention across science and
engineering. While most tensor decomposition methods are developed for a single
tensor observation, scientific studies often collect side information, in the
form of node features and interactions thereof, together with the tensor data.
Such data problems are common in neuroimaging, network analysis, and
spatial-temporal modeling. Identifying the relationship between a
high-dimensional tensor and side information is important yet challenging.
Here, we develop a tensor decomposition method that incorporates multiple
feature matrices as side information. Unlike unsupervised tensor decomposition,
our supervised decomposition captures the effective dimension reduction of the
data tensor confined to feature space of interest. An efficient alternating
optimization algorithm with provable spectral initialization is further
developed. Our proposal handles a broad range of data types, including
continuous, count, and binary observations. We apply the method to diffusion
tensor imaging data from human connectome project and multi-relational
political network data. We identify the key global connectivity pattern and
pinpoint the local regions that are associated with available features. Our
simulation code, R-package tensorregress, and datasets used in the paper are

                                        <span>Metric learning has received conflicting assessments concerning its
suitability for solving instance segmentation tasks. It has been dismissed as
theoretically flawed due to the shift equivariance of the employed CNNs and
their respective inability to distinguish same-looking objects. Yet it has been
shown to yield state of the art results for a variety of tasks, and practical
issues have mainly been reported in the context of tile-and-stitch approaches,
where discontinuities at tile boundaries have been observed. To date, neither
of the reported issues have undergone thorough formal analysis. In our work, we
contribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties
of encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and
cannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects. In
particular, we prove that a standard encoder-decoder network that takes
$d$-dimensional images as input, with $l$ pooling layers and pooling factor
$f$, has the capacity to distinguish at most $f^{dl}$ same-looking objects, and
we show that this upper limit can be reached. Furthermore, we show that to
avoid discontinuities in a tile-and-stitch approach, assuming standard batch
size 1, it is necessary to employ valid convolutions in combination with a
training output window size strictly greater than $f^l$, while at test-time it
is necessary to crop tiles to size $n\cdot f^l$ before stitching, with $n\geq
1$. We complement these theoretical findings by discussing a number of
insightful special cases for which we show empirical results on synthetic data.</span>

                                        <span>Predictor-based algorithms have achieved remarkable performance in the Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) tasks. However, these methods suffer from high
computation costs, as training the performance predictor usually requires
training and evaluating hundreds of architectures from scratch. Previous works
along this line mainly focus on reducing the number of architectures required
to fit the predictor. In this work, we tackle this challenge from a different
perspective - improve search efficiency by cutting down the computation budget
of architecture training. We propose NOn-uniform Successive Halving (NOSH), a
hierarchical scheduling algorithm that terminates the training of
underperforming architectures early to avoid wasting budget. To effectively
leverage the non-uniform supervision signals produced by NOSH, we formulate
predictor-based architecture search as learning to rank with pairwise
comparisons. The resulting method - RANK-NOSH, reduces the search budget by ~5x
while achieving competitive or even better performance than previous
state-of-the-art predictor-based methods on various spaces and datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Background: Histopathology is an important modality for the diagnosis and
management of many diseases in modern healthcare, and plays a critical role in
cancer care. Pathology samples can be large and require multi-site sampling,
leading to upwards of 20 slides for a single tumor, and the human-expert tasks
of site selection and and quantitative assessment of mitotic figures are time
consuming and subjective. Automating these tasks in the setting of a digital
pathology service presents significant opportunities to improve workflow
efficiency and augment human experts in practice. Approach: Multiple
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for histopathology image
classification and mitotic figure detection were used in the development of
OncoPetNet. Additionally, model-free approaches were used to increase speed and
accuracy. The robust and scalable inference engine leverages Pytorch&#x27;s
performance optimizations as well as specifically developed speed up techniques
in inference. Results: The proposed system, demonstrated significantly improved
mitotic counting performance for 41 cancer cases across 14 cancer types
compared to human expert baselines. In 21.9% of cases use of OncoPetNet led to
change in tumor grading compared to human expert evaluation. In deployment, an
effective 0.27 min/slide inference was achieved in a high throughput veterinary
diagnostic pathology service across 2 centers processing 3,323 digital whole
slide images daily. Conclusion: This work represents the first successful
automated deployment of deep learning systems for real-time expert-level
performance on important histopathology tasks at scale in a high volume
clinical practice. The resulting impact outlines important considerations for
model development, deployment, clinical decision making, and informs best
practices for implementation of deep learning systems in digital histopathology
practices.</span>

                                        <span>E-commerce websites use machine learned ranking models to serve shopping
results to customers. Typically, the websites log the customer search events,
which include the query entered and the resulting engagement with the shopping
results, such as clicks and purchases. Each customer search event serves as
input training data for the models, and the individual customer engagement
serves as a signal for customer preference. So a purchased shopping result, for
example, is perceived to be more important than one that is not. However, new
or under-impressed products do not have enough customer engagement signals and
end up at a disadvantage when being ranked alongside popular products. In this
paper, we propose a novel method for data curation that aggregates all customer
engagements within a day for the same query to use as input training data. This
aggregated customer engagement gives the models a complete picture of the
relative importance of shopping results. Training models on this aggregated
data leads to less reliance on behavioral features. This helps mitigate the
cold start problem and boosted relevant new products to top search results. In
this paper, we present the offline and online analysis and results comparing
the individual and aggregated customer engagement models trained on e-commerce
data.</span>

                                        <span>Deep retrieval models are widely used for learning entity representations and
recommendations. Federated learning provides a privacy-preserving way to train
these models without requiring centralization of user data. However, federated
deep retrieval models usually perform much worse than their centralized
counterparts due to non-IID (independent and identically distributed) training
data on clients, an intrinsic property of federated learning that limits
negatives available for training. We demonstrate that this issue is distinct
from the commonly studied client drift problem. This work proposes
batch-insensitive losses as a way to alleviate the non-IID negatives issue for
federated movie recommendation. We explore a variety of techniques and identify
that batch-insensitive losses can effectively improve the performance of
federated deep retrieval models, increasing the relative recall of the
federated model by up to 93.15% and reducing the relative gap in recall between
it and a centralized model from 27.22% - 43.14% to 0.53% - 2.42%. We
open-source our code framework to accelerate further research and applications
of federated deep retrieval models.</span>

capture the timely dependencies in sequences. However, with the introduction of
the Transformer, it has been proven that an architecture with only
attention-mechanisms without any RNN can improve on the results in various
sequence processing tasks (e.g. NLP). Multiple studies since then have shown
that similar approaches can be applied for images, point clouds, video, audio

Informer have been introduced to expand on the applicability of the
Transformer. Our main objective is testing and evaluating the effectiveness of
applying Transformer-like models on time series data, tackling susceptibility

                                        <span>Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on Contact
Tracing (CT) models has significantly increased to prevent spread of this
highly contagious virus and be prepared for the potential future ones. Since
the spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is
much higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to
develop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT
solutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The
paper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system
for Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed
to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized
access. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain
platform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) credit-based
consensus algorithm coupled with Randomized Hash Window (W-Hash) and dynamic
Proof of Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest
nodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but
also quantifies the node&#x27;s behavior based on its underlying credit-based
mechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on
availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures,
and develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) sensor measurements. The simulation results show that the proposed TB-ICT
prevents the COVID-19 from spreading by implementation of a highly accurate
contact tracing model while improving the users&#x27; privacy and security.</span>

                                        <span>The standard problem setting in Dec-POMDPs is self-play, where the goal is to
find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through
self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step
reasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents&#x27; actions and thus
fail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To
address this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents
follow a policy $\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a
given, fixed policy ($\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken
by $\pi_1$. When $\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy
that does not rely on inferences based on other agents&#x27; behavior (an optimal
grounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy
from one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level
cognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which
may converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,
making it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC). OBL can be scaled to
high-dimensional settings with a fictitious transition mechanism and shows
strong performance in both a toy-setting and the benchmark human-AI &amp; ZSC
problem Hanabi.</span>

                                        <span>Credit scoring models, which are among the most potent risk management tools
that banks and financial institutes rely on, have been a popular subject for
research in the past few decades. Accordingly, many approaches have been
developed to address the challenges in classifying loan applicants and improve
and facilitate decision-making. The imbalanced nature of credit scoring
datasets, as well as the heterogeneous nature of features in credit scoring
datasets, pose difficulties in developing and implementing effective credit
scoring models, targeting the generalization power of classification models on
unseen data. In this paper, we propose the Bagging Supervised Autoencoder
Classifier (BSAC) that mainly leverages the superior performance of the
Supervised Autoencoder, which learns low-dimensional embeddings of the input
data exclusively with regards to the ultimate classification task of credit
scoring, based on the principles of multi-task learning. BSAC also addresses
the data imbalance problem by employing a variant of the Bagging process based
on the undersampling of the majority class. The obtained results from our
experiments on the benchmark and real-life credit scoring datasets illustrate
the robustness and effectiveness of the Bagging Supervised Autoencoder
Classifier in the classification of loan applicants that can be regarded as a
positive development in credit scoring models.</span>

priors with the aim of learning meaningful features. However, this was done
without considering the description length of the learned representations which
is a direct and unbiased measure of the model complexity. In this paper, first
we introduce the $\varphi$ metric that evaluates unsupervised models based on
their reconstruction accuracy and the degree of compression of their internal
representations. We then present and define two activation functions (Identity,
ReLU) as base of reference and three sparse activation functions (top-k
absolutes, Extrema-Pool indices, Extrema) as candidate structures that minimize
the previously defined $\varphi$. We lastly present Sparsely Activated Networks
(SANs) that consist of kernels with shared weights that, during encoding, are
convolved with the input and then passed through a sparse activation function.
During decoding, the same weights are convolved with the sparse activation map
and subsequently the partial reconstructions from each weight are summed to
reconstruct the input. We compare SANs using the five previously defined
activation functions on a variety of datasets (Physionet, UCI-epilepsy, MNIST,
FMNIST) and show that models that are selected using $\varphi$ have small
description representation length and consist of interpretable kernels.</span>

about agents&#x27; intent is important to accurately forecast their motion. However,
the current research activities are not directly applicable to intelligent and
safety critical systems. This is mainly because very few public datasets are
available, and they only consider pedestrian-specific intents for a short
temporal horizon from a restricted egocentric view. To this end, we propose
LOKI (LOng term and Key Intentions), a novel large-scale dataset that is
designed to tackle joint trajectory and intention prediction for heterogeneous
traffic agents (pedestrians and vehicles) in an autonomous driving setting. The
LOKI dataset is created to discover several factors that may affect intention,
including i) agent&#x27;s own will, ii) social interactions, iii) environmental
constraints, and iv) contextual information. We also propose a model that
jointly performs trajectory and intention prediction, showing that recurrently
reasoning about intention can assist with trajectory prediction. We show our
method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by upto
$27\%$ and also provide a baseline for frame-wise intention estimation.</span>

different scenarios of longitudinal brain evolution. In this work,we present a
deep learning framework for hyper-elastic strain modelling of brain atrophy,
during healthy ageing and in Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease. The framework directly models
the effects of age, disease status, and scan interval to regress regional
patterns of atrophy, from which a strain-based model estimates deformations.
This model is trained and validated using 3D structural magnetic resonance
imaging data from the ADNI cohort. Results show that the framework can estimate
realistic deformations, following the known course of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, that
clearly differentiate between healthy and demented patterns of ageing. This
suggests the framework has potential to be incorporated into explainable models
of disease, for the exploration of interventions and counterfactual examples.</span>

and challenging with increasing shares of renewable energy sources due to their
decentralized structure, reduced inertia and volatility. We investigate the
feasibility of applying graph neural networks (GNN) to predict dynamic
stability of synchronisation in complex power grids using the single-node basin
stability (SNBS) as a measure. To do so, we generate two synthetic datasets for
grids with 20 and 100 nodes respectively and estimate SNBS using Monte-Carlo
sampling. Those datasets are used to train and evaluate the performance of
eight different GNN-models. All models use the full graph without
simplifications as input and predict SNBS in a nodal-regression-setup. We show
that SNBS can be predicted in general and the performance significantly changes
using different GNN-models. Furthermore, we observe interesting transfer
capabilities of our approach: GNN-models trained on smaller grids can directly
be applied on larger grids without the need of retraining.</span>

                                        <span>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) marks a milestone in Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), boasting simplicity and small search costs. However,
DARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some
operations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the
architecture. In this paper, we are the first to point out that the phenomenon
is attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely
uses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture
parameters simultaneously with the same data batch. Even single-level
optimization has been previously attempted, no literature provides a systematic
explanation on this essential point. Replacing the bi-level optimization,
Single-DARTS obviously alleviates performance collapse as well as enhances the
stability of architecture search. Experiment results show that Single-DARTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream search spaces. For
instance, on NAS-Benchmark-201, the searched architectures are nearly optimal
ones. We also validate that the single-level optimization framework is much
more stable than the bi-level one. We hope that this simple yet effective
method will give some insights on differential architecture search. The code is

and time-sensitive distinction between blood cells affected by Acute
Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and their healthy counterparts calls for the usage
of machine learning architectures. However, three of the most common models,
VGG, ResNet, and Inception, each come with their own set of flaws with room for
improvement which demands the need for a superior model. ALLNet, the proposed
hybrid convolutional neural network architecture, consists of a combination of
the VGG, ResNet, and Inception models. The ALL Challenge dataset of ISBI 2019
(available here) contains 10,691 images of white blood cells which were used to
train and test the models. 7,272 of the images in the dataset are of cells with
ALL and 3,419 of them are of healthy cells. Of the images, 60% were used to
train the model, 20% were used for the cross-validation set, and 20% were used
for the test set. ALLNet outperformed the VGG, ResNet, and the Inception models
across the board, achieving an accuracy of 92.6567%, a sensitivity of 95.5304%,
a specificity of 85.9155%, an AUC score of 0.966347, and an F1 score of 0.94803
in the cross-validation set. In the test set, ALLNet achieved an accuracy of
92.0991%, a sensitivity of 96.5446%, a specificity of 82.8035%, an AUC score of
0.959972, and an F1 score of 0.942963. The utilization of ALLNet in the
clinical workspace can better treat the thousands of people suffering from ALL
across the world, many of whom are children.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise and development of deep learning over the past decade, there
has been a steady momentum of innovation and breakthroughs that convincingly
push the state-of-the-art of cross-modal analytics between vision and language
in multimedia field. Nevertheless, there has not been an open-source codebase
in support of training and deploying numerous neural network models for
cross-modal analytics in a unified and modular fashion. In this work, we
propose X-modaler -- a versatile and high-performance codebase that
encapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several
general-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,
decoder, and decode strategy). Each stage is empowered with the functionality
that covers a series of modules widely adopted in state-of-the-arts and allows
seamless switching in between. This way naturally enables a flexible
implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video
captioning, and vision-language pre-training, aiming to facilitate the rapid
development of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular
designs in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across
different vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power
startup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual
question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.
X-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects
and pre-trained models are available on-line:

                                        <span>The prediction of express delivery sequence, i.e., modeling and estimating
the volumes of daily incoming and outgoing parcels for delivery, is critical
for online business, logistics, and positive customer experience, and
specifically for resource allocation optimization and promotional activity
arrangement. A precise estimate of consumer delivery requests has to involve
sequential factors such as shopping behaviors, weather conditions, events,
business campaigns, and their couplings. Besides, conventional sequence
prediction assumes a stable sequence evolution, failing to address complex
nonlinear sequences and various feature effects in the above multi-source data.
Although deep networks and attention mechanisms demonstrate the potential of
complex sequence modeling, extant networks ignore the heterogeneous and
coupling situation between features and sequences, resulting in weak prediction
accuracy. To address these issues, we propose DeepExpress - a deep-learning
based express delivery sequence prediction model, which extends the classic
seq2seq framework to learning complex coupling between sequence and features.
DeepExpress leverages an express delivery seq2seq learning, a
carefully-designed heterogeneous feature representation, and a novel joint
training attention mechanism to adaptively map heterogeneous data, and capture
sequence-feature coupling for precise estimation. Experimental results on
real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both shallow
and deep baseline models.</span>

learning model in the form of &quot;what-if scenarios&quot; without compromising the
fidelity-interpretability trade-off. They explain how to obtain a desired
prediction from the model by recommending small changes to the input features,
aka recourse. We believe an actionable recourse should be created based on
sound counterfactual explanations originating from the distribution of the
ground-truth data and linked to the domain knowledge. Moreover, it needs to
preserve the coherency between changed/unchanged features while satisfying
user/domain-specified constraints. This paper introduces CARE, a modular
explanation framework that addresses the model- and user-level desiderata in a
consecutive and structured manner. We tackle the existing requirements by
proposing novel and efficient solutions that are formulated in a
multi-objective optimization framework. The designed framework enables
including arbitrary requirements and generating counterfactual explanations and
actionable recourse by choice. As a model-agnostic approach, CARE generates
multiple, diverse explanations for any black-box model in tabular
classification and regression settings. Several experiments on standard data
sets and black-box models demonstrate the effectiveness of our modular
framework and its superior performance compared to the baselines.</span>

                                        <span>For all the ways convolutional neural nets have revolutionized computer
vision in recent years, one important aspect has received surprisingly little
attention: the effect of image size on the accuracy of tasks being trained for.
Typically, to be efficient, the input images are resized to a relatively small
spatial resolution (e.g. 224x224), and both training and inference are carried
out at this resolution. The actual mechanism for this re-scaling has been an
afterthought: Namely, off-the-shelf image resizers such as bilinear and bicubic
are commonly used in most machine learning software frameworks. But do these
resizers limit the on task performance of the trained networks? The answer is
yes. Indeed, we show that the typical linear resizer can be replaced with
learned resizers that can substantially improve performance. Importantly, while
the classical resizers typically result in better perceptual quality of the
downscaled images, our proposed learned resizers do not necessarily give better
visual quality, but instead improve task performance. Our learned image resizer
is jointly trained with a baseline vision model. This learned CNN-based resizer
creates machine friendly visual manipulations that lead to a consistent
improvement of the end task metric over the baseline model. Specifically, here
we focus on the classification task with the ImageNet dataset, and experiment
with four different models to learn resizers adapted to each model. Moreover,
we show that the proposed resizer can also be useful for fine-tuning the
classification baselines for other vision tasks. To this end, we experiment
with three different baselines to develop image quality assessment (IQA) models
on the AVA dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Recent literature on unsupervised learning focused on designing structural
priors with the aim of learning meaningful features, but without considering
the description length of the representations. In this thesis, first we
introduce the $\varphi$ metric that evaluates unsupervised models based on
their reconstruction accuracy and the degree of compression of their internal
representations. We then present and define two activation functions (Identity,
ReLU) as base of reference and three sparse activation functions (top-k
absolutes, Extrema-Pool indices, Extrema) as candidate structures that minimize
the previously defined metric $\varphi$. We lastly present Sparsely Activated
Networks (SANs) that consist of kernels with shared weights that, during
encoding, are convolved with the input and then passed through a sparse
activation function. During decoding, the same weights are convolved with the
sparse activation map and subsequently the partial reconstructions from each
weight are summed to reconstruct the input. We compare SANs using the five
previously defined activation functions on a variety of datasets (Physionet,
UCI-epilepsy, MNIST, FMNIST) and show that models that are selected using
$\varphi$ have small description representation length and consist of
interpretable kernels.</span>

                                        <span>Link prediction is one of the key problems for graph-structured data. With
the advancement of graph neural networks, graph autoencoders (GAEs) and
variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) have been proposed to learn graph
embeddings in an unsupervised way. It has been shown that these methods are
effective for link prediction tasks. However, they do not work well in link
predictions when a node whose degree is zero (i.g., isolated node) is involved.
We have found that GAEs/VGAEs make embeddings of isolated nodes close to zero
regardless of their content features. In this paper, we propose a novel
Variational Graph Normalized AutoEncoder (VGNAE) that utilize
$L_2$-normalization to derive better embeddings for isolated nodes. We show
that our VGNAEs outperform the existing state-of-the-art models for link
prediction tasks. The code is available at

                                        <span>Hypergraphs allow modeling problems with multi-way high-order relationships.
However, the computational cost of most existing hypergraph-based algorithms
can be heavily dependent upon the input hypergraph sizes. To address the
ever-increasing computational challenges, graph coarsening can be potentially
applied for preprocessing a given hypergraph by aggressively aggregating its
vertices (nodes). However, state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning
(clustering) methods that incorporate heuristic graph coarsening techniques are
not optimized for preserving the structural (global) properties of hypergraphs.
In this work, we propose an efficient spectral hypergraph coarsening scheme
(HyperSF) for well preserving the original spectral (structural) properties of
hypergraphs. Our approach leverages a recent strongly-local max-flow-based
clustering algorithm for detecting the sets of hypergraph vertices that
minimize ratio cut. To further improve the algorithm efficiency, we propose a
divide-and-conquer scheme by leveraging spectral clustering of the bipartite
graphs corresponding to the original hypergraphs. Our experimental results for
a variety of hypergraphs extracted from real-world VLSI design benchmarks show
that the proposed hypergraph coarsening algorithm can significantly improve the
multi-way conductance of hypergraph clustering as well as runtime efficiency
when compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</span>

by the need to characterize the robustness of deep neural networks. The
verifiers aspire to answer whether a neural network guarantees certain
properties with respect to all inputs in a space. However, many verifiers
inaccurately model floating point arithmetic but do not thoroughly discuss the
consequences.

We show that the negligence of floating point error leads to unsound
verification that can be systematically exploited in practice. For a pretrained
neural network, we present a method that efficiently searches inputs as
witnesses for the incorrectness of robustness claims made by a complete
verifier. We also present a method to construct neural network architectures
and weights that induce wrong results of an incomplete verifier. Our results
highlight that, to achieve practically reliable verification of neural
networks, any verification system must accurately (or conservatively) model the

described via manifolds, such as spheres, tori, and other implicit surfaces.
Current extensions of existing (Euclidean) generative models are restricted to
specific geometries and typically suffer from high computational costs. We
introduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family
of continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to
the change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its
model (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus
the divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear
differential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds.
Therefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating
through an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model
density explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an
ODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that
MF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions.
Empirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for
sampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in
density estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs
on challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from the earth
and climate sciences.</span>

human well-being across medical, social work, and legal domains. Labeled
datasets to train supervised deception detection models can rarely be collected
for real-world, high-stakes contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the
first unsupervised approach for detecting real-world, high-stakes deception in
videos without requiring labels. This paper presents our novel approach for
affect-aware unsupervised Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to learn discriminative
representations of deceptive and truthful behavior. Drawing on psychology
theories that link affect and deception, we experimented with unimodal and
multimodal DBN-based approaches trained on facial valence, facial arousal,
audio, and visual features. In addition to using facial affect as a feature on
which DBN models are trained, we also introduce a DBN training procedure that
uses facial affect as an aligner of audio-visual representations. We conducted
classification experiments with unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model clustering
to evaluate our approaches. Our best unsupervised approach (trained on facial
valence and visual features) achieved an AUC of 80%, outperforming human
ability and performing comparably to fully-supervised models. Our results
motivate future work on unsupervised, affect-aware computational approaches for

                                        <span>Hindsight experience replay (HER) is a goal relabelling technique typically
used with off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve
goal-oriented tasks; it is well suited to robotic manipulation tasks that
deliver only sparse rewards. In HER, both trajectories and transitions are
sampled uniformly for training. However, not all of the agent&#x27;s experiences
contribute equally to training, and so naive uniform sampling may lead to
inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose diversity-based trajectory and
goal selection with HER (DTGSH). Firstly, trajectories are sampled according to
the diversity of the goal states as modelled by determinantal point processes
(DPPs). Secondly, transitions with diverse goal states are selected from the
trajectories by using k-DPPs. We evaluate DTGSH on five challenging robotic
manipulation tasks in simulated robot environments, where we show that our
method can learn more quickly and reach higher performance than other
state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Recently there has been an explosion in the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods
for medical image segmentation. However the field&#x27;s reliability is hindered by
the lack of a common base of reference for accuracy/performance evaluation and
the fact that previous research uses different datasets for evaluation. In this
paper, an extensive comparison of DL models for lung and COVID-19 lesion
segmentation in Computerized Tomography (CT) scans is presented, which can also
be used as a benchmark for testing medical image segmentation models. Four DL
architectures (Unet, Linknet, FPN, PSPNet) are combined with 25 randomly
initialized and pretrained encoders (variations of VGG, DenseNet, ResNet,
ResNext, DPN, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-v4, EfficientNet), to construct
200 tested models. Three experimental setups are conducted for lung
segmentation, lesion segmentation and lesion segmentation using the original
lung masks. A public COVID-19 dataset with 100 CT scan images (80 for train, 20
for validation) is used for training/validation and a different public dataset
consisting of 829 images from 9 CT scan volumes for testing. Multiple findings
are provided including the best architecture-encoder models for each experiment
as well as mean Dice results for each experiment, architecture and encoder
independently. Finally, the upper bounds improvements when using lung masks as
a preprocessing step or when using pretrained models are quantified. The source
code and 600 pretrained models for the three experiments are provided, suitable
for fine-tuning in experimental setups without GPU capabilities.</span>

                                        <span>We initiate the study of multi-stage episodic reinforcement learning under
adversarial corruptions in both the rewards and the transition probabilities of
the underlying system extending recent results for the special case of
stochastic bandits. We provide a framework which modifies the aggressive
exploration enjoyed by existing reinforcement learning approaches based on
&quot;optimism in the face of uncertainty&quot;, by complementing them with principles
from &quot;action elimination&quot;. Importantly, our framework circumvents the major
challenges posed by naively applying action elimination in the RL setting, as
formalized by a lower bound we demonstrate. Our framework yields efficient
algorithms which (a) attain near-optimal regret in the absence of corruptions
and (b) adapt to unknown levels corruption, enjoying regret guarantees which
degrade gracefully in the total corruption encountered. To showcase the
generality of our approach, we derive results for both tabular settings (where
states and actions are finite) as well as linear-function-approximation
settings (where the dynamics and rewards admit a linear underlying
representation). Notably, our work provides the first sublinear regret
guarantee which accommodates any deviation from purely i.i.d. transitions in
the bandit-feedback model for episodic reinforcement learning.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are an attractive tool for compressing the control
policy lookup tables in systems such as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System
(ACAS). It is vital to ensure the safety of such neural controllers via
verification techniques. The problem of analyzing ACAS Xu networks has
motivated many successful neural network verifiers. These verifiers typically
analyze the internal computation of neural networks to decide whether a
property regarding the input/output holds. The intrinsic complexity of neural
network computation renders such verifiers slow to run and vulnerable to
floating-point error.

This paper revisits the original problem of verifying ACAS Xu networks. The
networks take low-dimensional sensory inputs with training data provided by a
precomputed lookup table. We propose to prepend an input quantization layer to
the network. Quantization allows efficient verification via input state
enumeration, whose complexity is bounded by the size of the quantization space.
Quantization is equivalent to nearest-neighbor interpolation at run time, which
has been shown to provide acceptable accuracy for ACAS in simulation. Moreover,
our technique can deliver exact verification results immune to floating-point
error if we directly enumerate the network outputs on the target inference
implementation or on an accurate simulation of the target implementation.</span>

create a combinatoric encoding of sequential inputs. Using several examples, we
show that the network can associate distant causes and effects in a discrete
stochastic process, predict partially-observable higher-order sequences, and
enable a DQN agent to navigate a maze by giving it memory. The network uses
only biologically-plausible, local and immediate credit assignment. Memory
requirements are typically one order of magnitude less than existing LSTM, GRU

limitation of the memory is generalization to unseen input sequences. We
explore this limitation by measuring next-word prediction perplexity on the

to perform their actions in a pre-determined order, to successfully achieve
certain functional goals. However, such obligations are often not followed
strictly by users, which may lead to the violation to security properties,
especially in security-critical systems. In order to improve the security with
the awareness of unexpected user behaviors, a system can be redesigned to a
more robust one by changing the order of actions in its specification.
Meanwhile, we anticipate that the functionalities would remain consistent
following the modifications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm
to automatically produce specification revisions tackling with attack scenarios
caused by the weakened user obligations. By our algorithm, all the revisions
maintain the integrity of the functionalities as the original specification,
which are generated using a novel recomposition approach. Then, the qualified
revisions that can satisfy the security requirements would be efficiently
spotted by a hybrid approach combining model checking and machine learning
techniques. We evaluate our algorithm by comparing its performance with a
state-of-the-art approach regarding their coverage and searching speed of the
desirable revisions.</span>

directly on devices distributed at the edge of the internet calls for edge
hardware capable of processing multiple modalities of sensory data (e.g. video,
audio) at unprecedented energy-efficiency. AI hardware architectures today
cannot meet the demand due to a fundamental &quot;memory wall&quot;: data movement
between separate compute and memory units consumes large energy and incurs long
latency. Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) based compute-in-memory (CIM)
architectures promise to bring orders of magnitude energy-efficiency
improvement by performing computation directly within memory. However,
conventional approaches to CIM hardware design limit its functional flexibility
necessary for processing diverse AI workloads, and must overcome hardware
imperfections that degrade inference accuracy. Such trade-offs between
efficiency, versatility and accuracy cannot be addressed by isolated
improvements on any single level of the design. By co-optimizing across all
hierarchies of the design from algorithms and architecture to circuits and
devices, we present NeuRRAM - the first multimodal edge AI chip using RRAM CIM
to simultaneously deliver a high degree of versatility for diverse model
architectures, record energy-efficiency $5\times$ - $8\times$ better than prior
art across various computational bit-precisions, and inference accuracy
comparable to software models with 4-bit weights on all measured standard AI
benchmarks including accuracy of 99.0% on MNIST and 85.7% on CIFAR-10 image
classification, 84.7% accuracy on Google speech command recognition, and a 70%
reduction in image reconstruction error on a Bayesian image recovery task. This

hardware platforms for the more demanding and heterogeneous AI applications of

encompassing a wide range of physical domains and applications. Recently, there
has been a surge in data-driven methods to complement traditional numerical
simulations methods, motivated by the opportunity to reduce computational costs
and/or learn new physical models leveraging access to large collections of
data. However, the diversity of problem settings and applications has led to a
plethora of approaches, each one evaluated on a different setup and with
different evaluation metrics. We introduce a set of benchmark problems to take
a step towards unified benchmarks and evaluation protocols. We propose four
representative physical systems, as well as a collection of both widely used
classical time integrators and representative data-driven methods
(kernel-based, MLP, CNN, nearest neighbors). Our framework allows evaluating
objectively and systematically the stability, accuracy, and computational
efficiency of data-driven methods. Additionally, it is configurable to permit
adjustments for accommodating other learning tasks and for establishing a
foundation for future developments in machine learning for scientific
computing.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, FCNs have attracted widespread attention in the CD field. In
pursuit of better CD performance, it has become a tendency to design deeper and
more complicated FCNs, which inevitably brings about huge numbers of parameters
and an unbearable computational burden. With the goal of designing a quite deep
architecture to obtain more precise CD results while simultaneously decreasing
parameter numbers to improve efficiency, in this work, we present a very deep
and efficient CD network, entitled EffCDNet. In EffCDNet, to reduce the
numerous parameters associated with deep architecture, an efficient convolution
consisting of depth-wise convolution and group convolution with a channel
shuffle mechanism is introduced to replace standard convolutional layers. In
terms of the specific network architecture, EffCDNet does not use mainstream
UNet-like architecture, but rather adopts the architecture with a very deep
encoder and a lightweight decoder. In the very deep encoder, two very deep
siamese streams stacked by efficient convolution first extract two highly
representative and informative feature maps from input image-pairs.
Subsequently, an efficient ASPP module is designed to capture multi-scale
change information. In the lightweight decoder, a recurrent criss-cross
self-attention (RCCA) module is applied to efficiently utilize non-local
similar feature representations to enhance discriminability for each pixel,
thus effectively separating the changed and unchanged regions. Moreover, to
tackle the optimization problem in confused pixels, two novel loss functions
based on information entropy are presented. On two challenging CD datasets, our
approach outperforms other SOTA FCN-based methods, with only benchmark-level
parameter numbers and quite low computational overhead.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training is one effective approach for training robust deep
neural networks against adversarial attacks. While being able to bring reliable
robustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity
models, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to
limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in
scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile
devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to
improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained
large models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a
distillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to
improved robustness: the use of robust soft labels -- predictions of a robust
model. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness
distillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD)
to train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft
labels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to
guide the student&#x27;s learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all
loss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach
over existing adversarial training and distillation methods in improving the
robustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the
AutoAttack. We also provide a set of understandings on our RSLAD and the
importance of robust soft labels for adversarial robustness distillation.</span>

(CNN) with a spatial attention block to optimise knee injury detection. An
open-source Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data set with image-level labels
was leveraged for this analysis. As MRI data is acquired from three planes, we
compare our technique using data from a single-plane and multiple planes
(multi-plane). For multi-plane, we investigate various methods of fusing the
planes in the network. This analysis resulted in the novel &#x27;MPFuseNet&#x27; network
and state-of-the-art Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores for detecting Anterior
Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears and Abnormal MRIs, achieving AUC scores of 0.977

Localisation Accuracy (PLA), to validate the model&#x27;s localisation ability. This
metric compares binary masks generated from Grad-Cam output and the
radiologist&#x27;s annotations on a sample of MRIs. We also extracted explainability
features in a model-agnostic approach that were then verified as clinically

                                        <span>Identifying covariate shift is crucial for making machine learning systems
robust in the real world and for detecting training data biases that are not
reflected in test data. However, detecting covariate shift is challenging,
especially when the data consists of high-dimensional images, and when multiple
types of localized covariate shift affect different subspaces of the data.
Although automated techniques can be used to detect the existence of covariate
shift, our goal is to help human users characterize the extent of covariate
shift in large image datasets with interfaces that seamlessly integrate
information obtained from the detection algorithms. In this paper, we design
and evaluate a new visual interface that facilitates the comparison of the
local distributions of training and test data. We conduct a quantitative user
study on multi-attribute facial data to compare two different learned
low-dimensional latent representations (pretrained ImageNet CNN vs. density
ratio) and two user analytic workflows (nearest-neighbor vs.
cluster-to-cluster). Our results indicate that the latent representation of our
density ratio model, combined with a nearest-neighbor comparison, is the most
effective at helping humans identify covariate shift.</span>

data items has been shown to yield an effective principle for data
visualization. However, even the currently best NE methods such as Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (SNE) may leave large-scale patterns such as clusters hidden
despite of strong signals being present in the data. To address this, we
propose a new cluster visualization method based on Neighbor Embedding. We
first present a family of Neighbor Embedding methods which generalizes SNE by
using non-normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence with a scale parameter. In
this family, much better cluster visualizations often appear with a parameter
value different from the one corresponding to SNE. We also develop an efficient
software which employs asynchronous stochastic block coordinate descent to
optimize the new family of objective functions. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method consistently and substantially improves

(ReLU) activation via gradient descent (GD) type optimization schemes is
nowadays a common industrially relevant procedure. Till this day in the
scientific literature there is in general no mathematical convergence analysis
which explains the numerical success of GD type optimization schemes in the
training of ANNs with ReLU activation. GD type optimization schemes can be
regarded as temporal discretization methods for the gradient flow (GF)
differential equations associated to the considered optimization problem and,
in view of this, it seems to be a natural direction of research to first aim to
develop a mathematical convergence theory for time-continuous GF differential
equations and, thereafter, to aim to extend such a time-continuous convergence
theory to implementable time-discrete GD type optimization methods. In this
article we establish two basic results for GF differential equations in the
training of fully-connected feedforward ANNs with one hidden layer and ReLU
activation. In the first main result of this article we establish in the
training of such ANNs under the assumption that the probability distribution of
the input data of the considered supervised learning problem is absolutely
continuous with a bounded density function that every GF differential equation
admits for every initial value a solution which is also unique among a suitable
class of solutions. In the second main result of this article we prove in the
training of such ANNs under the assumption that the target function and the
density function of the probability distribution of the input data are
piecewise polynomial that every non-divergent GF trajectory converges with an
appropriate rate of convergence to a critical point and that the risk of the
non-divergent GF trajectory converges with rate 1 to the risk of the critical
point.</span>

In this study, we aim to address the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) problem as one
of the open challenges in medical imaging. In this research, we propose a new
lesion detection architecture, comprising of two sub-modules, which is an
optimal solution to detect and find not only the type of lesions caused by DR,
their corresponding bounding boxes, and their masks; but also the severity
level of the overall case. Aside from traditional accuracy, we also use two
popular evaluation criteria to evaluate the outputs of our models, which are
intersection over union (IOU) and mean average precision (mAP). We hypothesize
that this new solution enables specialists to detect lesions with high
confidence and estimate the severity of the damage with high accuracy.</span>

$m$ discrete (unbalanced) measures with at most $n$ supports. We first prove
that we can obtain two equivalence forms of the multimarginal POT problem in
terms of the multimarginal optimal transport problem via novel extensions of
cost tensor. The first equivalence form is derived under the assumptions that
the total masses of each measure are sufficiently close while the second
equivalence form does not require any conditions on these masses but at the
price of more sophisticated extended cost tensor. Our proof techniques for
obtaining these equivalence forms rely on novel procedures of moving mass in
graph theory to push transportation plan into appropriate regions. Finally,
based on the equivalence forms, we develop optimization algorithm, named
ApproxMPOT algorithm, that builds upon the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the
entropic regularized multimarginal optimal transport. We demonstrate that the
ApproxMPOT algorithm can approximate the optimal value of multimarginal POT
problem with a computational complexity upper bound of the order
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^3(n+1)^{m}/ \varepsilon^2)$ where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$

                                        <span>With the rise and development of deep learning over the past decade, there
has been a steady momentum of innovation and breakthroughs that convincingly
push the state-of-the-art of cross-modal analytics between vision and language
in multimedia field. Nevertheless, there has not been an open-source codebase
in support of training and deploying numerous neural network models for
cross-modal analytics in a unified and modular fashion. In this work, we
propose X-modaler -- a versatile and high-performance codebase that
encapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several
general-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,
decoder, and decode strategy). Each stage is empowered with the functionality
that covers a series of modules widely adopted in state-of-the-arts and allows
seamless switching in between. This way naturally enables a flexible
implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video
captioning, and vision-language pre-training, aiming to facilitate the rapid
development of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular
designs in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across
different vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power
startup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual
question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.
X-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects
and pre-trained models are available on-line:

live-streaming games based on highlights (i.e., the exciting parts of video
clips) extracted from the game content and evaluate the effect of mental health
promotion. Game live streaming is becoming a popular theme for academic
research. Compared to traditional online video sharing platforms, such as
Youtube and Vimeo, video live streaming platform has the benefits of
communicating with other viewers in real-time. In sports broadcasting, the
commentator plays an essential role as mood maker by making matches more
exciting. The enjoyment emerged while watching game live streaming also
benefits the audience&#x27;s mental health. However, many e-sports live streaming
channels do not have a commentator for entertaining viewers. Therefore, this
paper presents a design of an AI commentator that can be embedded in live

the system employs highlight evaluation to detect the highlights, and generate
the bullet comments. An experiment is conducted and the effectiveness of

evaluated.</span>

                                        <span>Neural text matching models have been widely used in community question
answering, information retrieval, and dialogue. However, these models designed
for short texts cannot well address the long-form text matching problem,
because there are many contexts in long-form texts can not be directly aligned
with each other, and it is difficult for existing models to capture the key
matching signals from such noisy data. Besides, these models are
computationally expensive for simply use all textual data indiscriminately. To
tackle the effectiveness and efficiency problem, we propose a novel
hierarchical noise filtering model, namely Match-Ignition. The main idea is to
plug the well-known PageRank algorithm into the Transformer, to identify and
filter both sentence and word level noisy information in the matching process.
Noisy sentences are usually easy to detect because previous work has shown that
their similarity can be explicitly evaluated by the word overlapping, so we
directly use PageRank to filter such information based on a sentence similarity
graph. Unlike sentences, words rely on their contexts to express concrete
meanings, so we propose to jointly learn the filtering and matching process, to
well capture the critical word-level matching signals. Specifically, a word
graph is first built based on the attention scores in each self-attention block
of Transformer, and key words are then selected by applying PageRank on this
graph. In this way, noisy words will be filtered out layer by layer in the
matching process. Experimental results show that Match-Ignition outperforms
both SOTA short text matching models and recent long-form text matching models.
We also conduct detailed analysis to show that Match-Ignition efficiently
captures important sentences and words, to facilitate the long-form text
matching process.</span>

everyday social norms and moral judgments over a rich spectrum of real life
situations described in natural language. We introduce Social-Chem-101, a
large-scale corpus that catalogs 292k rules-of-thumb such as &quot;it is rude to run
a blender at 5am&quot; as the basic conceptual units. Each rule-of-thumb is further
broken down with 12 different dimensions of people&#x27;s judgments, including
social judgments of good and bad, moral foundations, expected cultural
pressure, and assumed legality, which together amount to over 4.5 million
annotations of categorical labels and free-text descriptions.

Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models
demonstrate that computational modeling of social norms is a promising research
direction. Our model framework, Neural Norm Transformer, learns and generalizes
Social-Chem-101 to successfully reason about previously unseen situations,
generating relevant (and potentially novel) attribute-aware social
rules-of-thumb.</span>

the problem of linking between people named in a caption and people pictured in
an image. In contrast to prior work in visual grounding, which is predominantly
object-based, our new task masks out the names of people in captions in order
to encourage methods trained on such image-caption pairs to focus on contextual
cues (such as rich interactions between multiple people), rather than learning
associations between names and appearances. To facilitate this task, we
introduce a new dataset, Who&#x27;s Waldo, mined automatically from image-caption
data on Wikimedia Commons. We propose a Transformer-based method that
outperforms several strong baselines on this task, and are releasing our data

                                        <span>Syntactic annotation of corpora in the form of part-of-speech (POS) tags is a
key requirement for both linguistic research and subsequent automated natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. This problem is commonly tackled using machine
learning methods, i.e., by training a POS tagger on a sufficiently large corpus
of labeled data. While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered
as solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more
difficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of
training data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today,
nor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS
tagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of
forcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be
enabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging
within the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to
express its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of
guessing a single one. The goal is to guarantee a high confidence that the
correct POS tag is included while keeping the number of candidates small. In
our experimental study, we find that extending state-of-the-art POS taggers to
set-valued prediction yields more precise and robust taggings, especially for
unknown words, i.e., words not occurring in the training data.</span>

                                        <span>Corpus preparation for low-resource languages and for development of human
language technology to analyze or computationally process them is a laborious
task, primarily due to the unavailability of expert linguists who are native
speakers of these languages and also due to the time and resources required.
Bhojpuri, Magahi, and Maithili, languages of the Purvanchal region of India (in
the north-eastern parts), are low-resource languages belonging to the
Indo-Aryan (or Indic) family. They are closely related to Hindi, which is a
relatively high-resource language, which is why we compare with Hindi. We
collected corpora for these three languages from various sources and cleaned
them to the extent possible, without changing the data in them. The text
belongs to different domains and genres. We calculated some basic statistical
measures for these corpora at character, word, syllable, and morpheme levels.
These corpora were also annotated with parts-of-speech (POS) and chunk tags.
The basic statistical measures were both absolute and relative and were
exptected to indicate of linguistic properties such as morphological, lexical,
phonological, and syntactic complexities (or richness). The results were
compared with a standard Hindi corpus. For most of the measures, we tried to
the corpus size the same across the languages to avoid the effect of corpus
size, but in some cases it turned out that using the full corpus was better,
even if sizes were very different. Although the results are not very clear, we
try to draw some conclusions about the languages and the corpora. For POS
tagging and chunking, the BIS tagset was used to manually annotate the data.
The POS tagged data sizes are 16067, 14669 and 12310 sentences, respectively,
for Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili. The sizes for chunking are 9695 and 1954
sentences for Bhojpuri and Maithili, respectively.</span>

now more engaged in expressing their opinions through various platforms such as
Twitter. Understanding the online discourses is therefore essential to capture
the public opinion. The goal of this study is the analysis of social media
platform to quantify public attitudes towards migrations and the identification
of different factors causing these attitudes. The tweets spanning from 2013 to
Jul-2021 in the European countries which are hosts to immigrants are collected,
pre-processed, and filtered using advanced topic modeling technique. BERT-based
entity linking and sentiment analysis, and attention-based hate speech
detection are performed to annotate the curated tweets. Moreover, the external
databases are used to identify the potential social and economic factors
causing negative attitudes of the people about migration. To further promote
research in the interdisciplinary fields of social science and computer
science, the outcomes are integrated into a Knowledge Base (KB), i.e.,
MigrationsKB which significantly extends the existing models to take into
account the public attitudes towards migrations and the economic indicators.
This KB is made public using FAIR principles, which can be queried through
SPARQL endpoint. Data dumps are made available on Zenodo.</span>

                                        <span>The recent success of distributed word representations has led to an
increased interest in analyzing the properties of their spatial distribution.
Current metrics suggest that contextualized word embedding models do not
uniformly utilize all dimensions when embedding tokens in vector space. Here we
argue that existing metrics are fragile and tend to obfuscate the true spatial
distribution of point clouds. To ameliorate this issue, we propose IsoScore: a
novel metric which quantifies the degree to which a point cloud uniformly
utilizes the ambient vector space. We demonstrate that IsoScore has several
desirable properties such as mean invariance and direct correspondence to the
number of dimensions used, which are properties that existing scores do not
possess. Furthermore, IsoScore is conceptually intuitive and computationally
efficient, making it well suited for analyzing the distribution of point clouds
in arbitrary vector spaces, not necessarily limited to those of word embeddings
alone. Additionally, we use IsoScore to demonstrate that a number of recent
conclusions in the NLP literature that have been derived using brittle metrics
of spatial distribution, such as average cosine similarity, may be incomplete
or altogether inaccurate.</span>

and models is a challenging task, especially given the variety of backgrounds,
skills, and incentives of the people involved in the building of natural
language processing (NLP) tools. Nevertheless, the adoption of standard
documentation practices across the field of NLP promotes more accessible and

documentation, we present two case studies of efforts that aim to develop
reusable documentation templates -- the HuggingFace data card, a general
purpose card for datasets in NLP, and the GEM benchmark data and model cards
with a focus on natural language generation. We describe our process for
developing these templates, including the identification of relevant
stakeholder groups, the definition of a set of guiding principles, the use of

                                        <span>Many generation tasks follow a one-to-many mapping relationship: each input
could be associated with multiple outputs. Existing methods like Conditional
Variational AutoEncoder(CVAE) employ a latent variable to model this
one-to-many relationship. However, this high-dimensional and dense latent
variable lacks explainability and usually leads to poor and uncontrollable
generations. In this paper, we innovatively introduce the linguistic concept of
pattern to decompose the one-to-many mapping into multiple one-to-one mappings
and further propose a model named Sparse Pattern Mixture of Experts(SPMoE).
Each one-to-one mapping is associated with a conditional generation pattern and
is modeled with an expert in SPMoE. To ensure each language pattern can be
exclusively handled with an expert model for better explainability and
diversity, a sparse mechanism is employed to coordinate all the expert models
in SPMoE. We assess the performance of our SPMoE on the paraphrase generation
task and the experiment results prove that SPMoE can achieve a good balance in
terms of quality, pattern-level diversity, and corpus-level diversity.</span>

spelling correction model with a shared context encoder and use a filtering
algorithm to handle large-size context lists. Experiments show that the model

reduction, which also significantly outperforms the baseline method such as

bases. Although there are various efforts to improve relation linking
performance, the current state-of-the-art methods do not achieve optimal
results, therefore, negatively impacting the overall end-to-end question
answering performance. In this work, we propose a novel approach for relation
linking framing it as a generative problem facilitating the use of pre-trained
sequence-to-sequence models. We extend such sequence-to-sequence models with
the idea of infusing structured data from the target knowledge base, primarily
to enable these models to handle the nuances of the knowledge base. Moreover,
we train the model with the aim to generate a structured output consisting of a
list of argument-relation pairs, enabling a knowledge validation step. We
compared our method against the existing relation linking systems on four
different datasets derived from DBpedia and Wikidata. Our method reports large
improvements over the state-of-the-art while using a much simpler model that
can be easily adapted to different knowledge bases.</span>

impartial examination of the system&#x27;s development, deployment, and use in
alignment with ethical values. System-level qualitative frameworks that
describe high-level requirements and component-level quantitative metrics that
measure individual ethical dimensions have been developed over the past few
years. However, there exists a gap between the two, which hinders the execution
of independent ethical assessments in practice. This study bridges this gap and
designs a holistic independent ethical assessment process for a text
classification model with a special focus on the task of hate speech detection.
The assessment is further augmented with protected attributes mining and
counterfactual-based analysis to enhance bias assessment. It covers assessments
of technical performance, data bias, embedding bias, classification bias, and
interpretability. The proposed process is demonstrated through an assessment of
a deep hate speech detection model.</span>

                                        <span>Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN)-based methods are widely used in dialect
identification. However, in previous work with TDNN application, subtle variant
is being neglected in different feature scales. To address this issue, we
propose a new architecture, named dynamic multi-scale convolution, which
consists of dynamic kernel convolution, local multi-scale learning, and global
multi-scale pooling. Dynamic kernel convolution captures features between
short-term and long-term context adaptively. Local multi-scale learning, which
represents multi-scale features at a granular level, is able to increase the
range of receptive fields for convolution operation. Besides, global
multi-scale pooling is applied to aggregate features from different bottleneck
layers in order to collect information from multiple aspects. The proposed
architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art system on the
AP20-OLR-dialect-task of oriental language recognition (OLR) challenge 2020,
with the best average cost performance (Cavg) of 0.067 and the best equal error
rate (EER) of 6.52%. Compared with the known best results, our method achieves

                                        <span>Different linearizations have been proposed to cast dependency parsing as
sequence labeling and solve the task as: (i) a head selection problem, (ii)
finding a representation of the token arcs as bracket strings, or (iii)
associating partial transition sequences of a transition-based parser to words.
Yet, there is little understanding about how these linearizations behave in
low-resource setups. Here, we first study their data efficiency, simulating
data-restricted setups from a diverse set of rich-resource treebanks. Second,
we test whether such differences manifest in truly low-resource setups. The
results show that head selection encodings are more data-efficient and perform
better in an ideal (gold) framework, but that such advantage greatly vanishes
in favour of bracketing formats when the running setup resembles a real-world
low-resource configuration.</span>

to a single-speaker model, when the suggested system is fine tuned to a
speaker, it produces significantly better quality in most of the cases while it
only uses less than $40\%$ of the speaker&#x27;s data used to build the

annotation, revising and extending the guidelines regularly during the

where labels 1 and 2 are used for negative candidates (not paraphrases), while
labels 3 and 4 are paraphrases at least in the given context if not everywhere.
In addition to base labeling, the scheme is enriched with additional
subcategories (flags) for categorizing different types of paraphrases inside
the two positive labels, making the annotation scheme suitable for more
fine-grained paraphrase categorization. The annotation scheme is used to

valuable resource and significant challenge to analysts aiming to profile and
understand social and cultural trends in a geographic location of interest.
While an abundance of news reports documenting significant events, trends, and
responses provides a more democratized picture of the social characteristics of
a location, making sense of an entire corpus to extract significant trends is a
steep challenge for any one analyst or team. Here, we present an approach using
natural language processing techniques that seeks to quantify how a set of
pre-defined topics of interest change over time across a large corpus of text.
We found that, given a predefined topic, we can identify and rank sets of
terms, or n-grams, that map to those topics and have usage patterns that
deviate from a normal baseline. Emergence, disappearance, or significant
variations in n-gram usage present a ground-up picture of a topic&#x27;s dynamic
salience within a corpus of interest.</span>

                                        <span>Protein is linked to almost every life process. Therefore, analyzing the
biological structure and property of protein sequences is critical to the
exploration of life, as well as disease detection and drug discovery.
Traditional protein analysis methods tend to be labor-intensive and
time-consuming. The emergence of deep learning models makes modeling data
patterns in large quantities of data possible. Interdisciplinary researchers
have begun to leverage deep learning methods to model large biological
datasets, e.g. using long short-term memory and convolutional neural network
for protein sequence classification. After millions of years of evolution,
evolutionary information is encoded in protein sequences. Inspired by the
similarity between natural language and protein sequences, we use large-scale
language models to model evolutionary-scale protein sequences, encoding protein
biology information in representation. Significant improvements are observed in
both token-level and sequence-level tasks, demonstrating that our large-scale
model can accurately capture evolution information from pretraining on
evolutionary-scale individual sequences. Our code and model are available at

                                        <span>Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) is a foundational equational framework for
reasoning about programs, which has found applications in program
transformations, networking and compiler optimizations, among many other areas.
In his seminal work, Kozen proved that KAT subsumes propositional Hoare logic,
showing that one can reason about the (partial) correctness of while programs
by means of the equational theory of KAT.

In this work, we investigate the support that KAT provides for reasoning
about \emph{incorrectness}, instead, as embodied by Ohearn&#x27;s recently proposed
incorrectness logic. We show that KAT cannot directly express incorrectness
logic. The main reason for this limitation can be traced to the fact that KAT
cannot express explicitly the notion of codomain, which is essential to express
incorrectness triples. To address this issue, we study Kleene algebra with Top
and Tests (TopKAT), an extension of KAT with a top element. We show that TopKAT
is powerful enough to express a codomain operation, to express incorrectness
triples, and to prove all the rules of incorrectness logic sound. This shows
that one can reason about the incorrectness of while-like programs by means of
the equational theory of TopKAT.</span>

training data. We present a methodology for programmatically identifying and
removing harmful text from web-scale datasets. A pretrained language model is
used to calculate the log-likelihood of researcher-written trigger phrases
conditioned on a specific document, which is used to identify and filter
documents from the dataset. We demonstrate that models trained on this filtered
dataset exhibit lower propensity to generate harmful text, with a marginal
decrease in performance on standard language modeling benchmarks compared to
unfiltered baselines. We provide a partial explanation for this performance gap
by surfacing examples of hate speech and other undesirable content from
standard language modeling benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the generalization
of this method and how trigger phrases which reflect specific values can be
used by researchers to build language models which are more closely aligned

mainly consist of textual, acoustic and visual modalities. Prior works on
multimodal sentiment analysis mostly apply Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to
model aligned multimodal sequences. However, it is unpractical to align
multimodal sequences due to different sample rates for different modalities.
Moreover, RNN is prone to the issues of gradient vanishing or exploding and it
has limited capacity of learning long-range dependency which is the major
obstacle to model unaligned multimodal sequences. In this paper, we introduce
Graph Capsule Aggregation (GraphCAGE) to model unaligned multimodal sequences
with graph-based neural model and Capsule Network. By converting sequence data
into graph, the previously mentioned problems of RNN are avoided. In addition,
the aggregation capability of Capsule Network and the graph-based structure
enable our model to be interpretable and better solve the problem of long-range
dependency. Experimental results suggest that GraphCAGE achieves

                                        <span>Language models (LMs) pre-trained on massive amounts of text, in particular
bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), generative
pre-training (GPT), and GPT-2, have become a key technology for many natural
language processing tasks. In this paper, we present results using fine-tuned
GPT, GPT-2, and their combination for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Unlike unidirectional LM GPT and GPT-2, BERT is bidirectional whose direct
product of the output probabilities is no longer a valid language prior
probability. A conversion method is proposed to compute the correct language
prior probability based on bidirectional LM outputs in a mathematically exact
way. Experimental results on the widely used AMI and Switchboard ASR tasks
showed that the combination of the fine-tuned GPT and GPT-2 outperformed the
combination of three neural LMs with different architectures trained from
scratch on the in-domain text by up to a 12% relative word error rate reduction
(WERR). Furthermore, the proposed conversion for language prior probabilities
enables BERT to receive an extra 3% relative WERR, and the combination of BERT,
GPT and GPT-2 results in further improvements.</span>

                                        <span>Scene understanding under low-light conditions is a challenging problem. This
is due to the small number of photons captured by the camera and the resulting
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Single-photon cameras (SPCs) are an emerging
sensing modality that are capable of capturing images with high sensitivity.
Despite having minimal read-noise, images captured by SPCs in photon-starved
conditions still suffer from strong shot noise, preventing reliable scene
inference. We propose photon scale-space a collection of high-SNR images
spanning a wide range of photons-per-pixel (PPP) levels (but same scene
content) as guides to train inference model on low photon flux images. We
develop training techniques that push images with different illumination levels
closer to each other in feature representation space. The key idea is that
having a spectrum of different brightness levels during training enables
effective guidance, and increases robustness to shot noise even in extreme
noise cases. Based on the proposed approach, we demonstrate, via simulations
and real experiments with a SPAD camera, high-performance on various inference
tasks such as image classification and monocular depth estimation under ultra
low-light, down to &lt; 1 PPP.</span>

                                        <span>Label distributions in real-world are oftentimes long-tailed and imbalanced,
resulting in biased models towards dominant labels. While long-tailed
recognition has been extensively studied for image classification tasks,
limited effort has been made for video domain. In this paper, we introduce
VideoLT, a large-scale long-tailed video recognition dataset, as a step toward
real-world video recognition. Our VideoLT contains 256,218 untrimmed videos,
annotated into 1,004 classes with a long-tailed distribution. Through extensive
studies, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods used for long-tailed
image recognition do not perform well in the video domain due to the additional
temporal dimension in video data. This motivates us to propose FrameStack, a
simple yet effective method for long-tailed video recognition task. In
particular, FrameStack performs sampling at the frame-level in order to balance
class distributions, and the sampling ratio is dynamically determined using
knowledge derived from the network during training. Experimental results
demonstrate that FrameStack can improve classification performance without
sacrificing overall accuracy. Code and dataset are available at:

                                        <span>Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and
crucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on
short-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level
predictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level
prediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves
along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic
Segment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be
more specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional
operation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets
adaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be
combined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform
powerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video
architecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several
video recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,
Something-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed
DSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.
For example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is
improved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400. Codes are available at

                                        <span>The convolutional neural network (CNN) is vulnerable to degraded images with
even very small variations (e.g. corrupted and adversarial samples). One of the
possible reasons is that CNN pays more attention to the most discriminative
regions, but ignores the auxiliary features when learning, leading to the lack
of feature diversity for final judgment. In our method, we propose to
dynamically suppress significant activation values of CNN by group-wise
inhibition, but not fixedly or randomly handle them when training. The feature
maps with different activation distribution are then processed separately to
take the feature independence into account. CNN is finally guided to learn
richer discriminative features hierarchically for robust classification
according to the proposed regularization. Our method is comprehensively
evaluated under multiple settings, including classification against
corruptions, adversarial attacks and low data regime. Extensive experimental
results show that the proposed method can achieve significant improvements in
terms of both robustness and generalization performances, when compared with
the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

85% of the external information is obtained through the vision system. It
largely influences our mobility, cognition, information access, and interaction
with the environment as well as with other people. Blindness prevents a person
from gaining knowledge of the surrounding environment and makes unassisted
navigation, object recognition, obstacle avoidance, and reading tasks major
challenges. Many existing systems are often limited by cost and complexity. To
help the visually challenged overcome these difficulties faced in everyday
life, we propose the idea of VisBuddy, a smart assistant which will help the
visually challenged with their day-to-day activities. VisBuddy is a voice-based
assistant, where the user can give voice commands to perform specific tasks.
VisBuddy uses the techniques of image captioning for describing the user&#x27;s
surroundings, optical character recognition (OCR) for reading the text in the
user&#x27;s view, object detection to search and find the objects in a room and web
scraping to give the user the latest news. VisBuddy has been built by combining
the concepts from Deep Learning and the Internet of Things. Thus, VisBuddy
serves as a cost-efficient, powerful and all-in-one assistant for the visually

graphical neural networks. Unlike conventional methods, where nodes send scaled
but otherwise identical messages to each of their neighbours, we propose to
condition messages between pairs of nodes on their spatial relationships,
resulting in different messages going to neighbours of the same node. To this
end, we explore various ways of applying spatial conditioning under a
multi-branch structure. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate the
advantages of spatial conditioning for the computation of the adjacency
structure, messages and the refined graph features. In particular, we
empirically show that as the quality of the bounding boxes increases, their
coarse appearance features contribute relatively less to the disambiguation of
interactions compared to the spatial information. Our method achieves an mAP of
31.33% on HICO-DET and 54.2% on V-COCO, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art on fine-tuned detections.</span>

low-resolution images with unknown and complex degradations, they are still far
from addressing general real-world degraded images. In this work, we extend the
powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN),
which is trained with pure synthetic data. Specifically, a high-order
degradation modeling process is introduced to better simulate complex
real-world degradations. We also consider the common ringing and overshoot
artifacts in the synthesis process. In addition, we employ a U-Net
discriminator with spectral normalization to increase discriminator capability
and stabilize the training dynamics. Extensive comparisons have shown its
superior visual performance than prior works on various real datasets. We also
provide efficient implementations to synthesize training pairs on the fly.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional face super-resolution methods usually assume testing
low-resolution (LR) images lie in the same domain as the training ones. Due to
different lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between
training and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios.
Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR)
performance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain
efficiently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem,
we develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network, named
DAP-FSR network. Our DAP-FSR is the first attempt to super-resolve LR faces
from a target domain by exploiting only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR
exemplar in the target domain. To be specific, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its
encoder to extract the multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face.
Considering only one target domain example is available, we propose to augment
the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target
domain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representations to
the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images
resembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are
used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating
the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the
target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces.
Extensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks validate the
effectiveness and superior performance of our DAP-FSR compared to the
state-of-the-art.</span>

parameters. These parameters act as &quot;memory&quot; for the trained models and help
them generalize well on unseen data. However, in absence of training data, the
utility of a trained model is merely limited to either inference or better
initialization towards a target task. In this paper, we go further and extract
synthetic data by leveraging the learnt model parameters. We dub them &quot;Data
Impressions&quot;, which act as proxy to the training data and can be used to
realize a variety of tasks. These are useful in scenarios where only the
pretrained models are available and the training data is not shared (e.g., due
to privacy or sensitivity concerns). We show the applicability of data
impressions in solving several computer vision tasks such as unsupervised
domain adaptation, continual learning as well as knowledge distillation. We
also study the adversarial robustness of lightweight models trained via
knowledge distillation using these data impressions. Further, we demonstrate
the efficacy of data impressions in generating data-free Universal Adversarial
Perturbations (UAPs) with better fooling rates. Extensive experiments performed

their excellent real-time performance as raw data from most of the mainstream
3D sensors. Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular
research direction in recent years. So far, however, there has been little
discussion about the explainability of deep neural networks for point clouds.
In this paper, we propose a point cloud-applicable explainability approach
based on local surrogate model-based method to show which components contribute
to the classification. Moreover, we propose quantitative fidelity validations
for generated explanations that enhance the persuasive power of explainability
and compare the plausibility of different existing point cloud-applicable
explainability methods. Our new explainability approach provides a fairly

point cloud classification tasks. Our code is available at

learning generative models of textured 3D meshes from image collections. These
models natively disentangle pose and appearance, enable downstream applications
in computer graphics, and improve the ability of generative models to
understand the concept of image formation. Although there has been prior work
on learning such models from collections of 2D images, these approaches require
a delicate pose estimation step that exploits annotated keypoints, thereby
restricting their applicability to a few specific datasets. In this work, we
propose a GAN framework for generating textured triangle meshes without relying
on such annotations. We show that the performance of our approach is on par
with prior work that relies on ground-truth keypoints, and more importantly, we
demonstrate the generality of our method by setting new baselines on a larger
set of categories from ImageNet - for which keypoints are not available -
without any class-specific hyperparameter tuning. We release our code at

analyze our PaCo loss under a balanced setting. Our analysis demonstrates that
PaCo can adaptively enhance the intensity of pushing samples of the same class
close as more samples are pulled together with their corresponding centers and
benefit hard example learning. Experiments on long-tailed CIFAR, ImageNet,

cardiovascular disease patients worldwide for a long time. Therefore, automated
diagnosis of CAD has indispensable significance in clinical medicine. However,
the complexity of coronary artery plaques that cause CAD makes the automatic
detection of coronary artery stenosis in Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) a
difficult task. In this paper, we propose a Transformer network (TR-Net) for
the automatic detection of significant stenosis (i.e. luminal narrowing &gt; 50%)
while practically completing the computer-assisted diagnosis of CAD. The
proposed TR-Net introduces a novel Transformer, and tightly combines
convolutional layers and Transformer encoders, allowing their advantages to be
demonstrated in the task. By analyzing semantic information sequences, TR-Net
can fully understand the relationship between image information in each

significant stenosis based on both local and global information. We evaluate
our TR-Net on a dataset of 76 patients from different patients annotated by
experienced radiologists. Experimental results illustrate that our TR-Net has

                                        <span>The label shift problem refers to the supervised learning setting where the
train and test label distributions do not match. Existing work addressing label
shift usually assumes access to an \emph{unlabelled} test sample. This sample
may be used to estimate the test label distribution, and to then train a
suitably re-weighted classifier. While approaches using this idea have proven
effective, their scope is limited as it is not always feasible to access the
target domain; further, they require repeated retraining if the model is to be
deployed in \emph{multiple} test environments. Can one instead learn a
\emph{single} classifier that is robust to arbitrary label shifts from a broad
family? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a model that
minimises an objective based on distributionally robust optimisation (DRO). We
then design and analyse a gradient descent-proximal mirror ascent algorithm
tailored for large-scale problems to optimise the proposed objective. %, and
establish its convergence. Finally, through experiments on CIFAR-100 and
ImageNet, we show that our technique can significantly improve performance over
a number of baselines in settings where label shift is present.</span>

                                        <span>Current state-of-the-art image captioning models adopt autoregressive
decoders, \ie they generate each word by conditioning on previously generated
words, which leads to heavy latency during inference. To tackle this issue,
non-autoregressive image captioning models have recently been proposed to
significantly accelerate the speed of inference by generating all words in
parallel. However, these non-autoregressive models inevitably suffer from large
generation quality degradation since they remove words dependence excessively.
To make a better trade-off between speed and quality, we introduce a
semi-autoregressive model for image captioning~(dubbed as SATIC), which keeps
the autoregressive property in global but generates words parallelly in local .
Based on Transformer, there are only a few modifications needed to implement
SATIC. Experimental results on the MSCOCO image captioning benchmark show that
SATIC can achieve a good trade-off without bells and whistles. Code is

                                        <span>We introduce the first Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to find a
better transformer architecture for image recognition. Recently, transformers
without CNN-based backbones are found to achieve impressive performance for
image recognition. However, the transformer is designed for NLP tasks and thus
could be sub-optimal when directly used for image recognition. In order to
improve the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new
search space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality
module that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer
computational cost. With the locality module, our search space is defined to
let the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information
as well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the
problem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search
method is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels
separately with the evolutionary algorithm. Extensive experiments on the
ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can find more discriminative and
efficient transformer variants than the ResNet family (e.g., ResNet101) and the
baseline ViT for image classification.</span>

reference images. Existing universal style transfer methods successfully
deliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a
photo-realistic way. However, the range of &#x27;arbitrary style&#x27; defined by
existing works is bounded in the particular domain due to their structural
limitation. Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization
are established according to a predefined target domain. As a result, both
photo-realistic and artistic models have difficulty in performing the desired
style transfer for the other domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
unified architecture, Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN) that transfer
not only the style but also the property of domain (i.e., domainness) from a
given reference image. To this end, we design a novel domainness indicator that
captures the domainness value from the texture and structural features of
reference images. Moreover, we introduce a unified framework with domain-aware

state-of-the-art video localization methods operate atop precomputed video clip
features. These features are extracted from video encoders typically trained
for trimmed action classification tasks, making such features not necessarily
suitable for temporal localization. In this work, we propose a novel supervised
pretraining paradigm for clip features that not only trains to classify
activities but also considers background clips and global video information to
improve temporal sensitivity. Extensive experiments show that using features
trained with our novel pretraining strategy significantly improves the
performance of recent state-of-the-art methods on three tasks: Temporal Action
Localization, Action Proposal Generation, and Dense Video Captioning. We also
show that our pretraining approach is effective across three encoder
architectures and two pretraining datasets. We believe video feature encoding
is an important building block for localization algorithms, and extracting
temporally-sensitive features should be of paramount importance in building
more accurate models. The code and pretrained models are available on our

                                        <span>Human motion prediction is a challenging task due to the stochasticity and
aperiodicity of future poses. Recently, graph convolutional network has been
proven to be very effective to learn dynamic relations among pose joints, which
is helpful for pose prediction. On the other hand, one can abstract a human
pose recursively to obtain a set of poses at multiple scales. With the increase
of the abstraction level, the motion of the pose becomes more stable, which
benefits pose prediction too. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Scale
Residual Graph Convolution Network (MSR-GCN) for human pose prediction task in
the manner of end-to-end. The GCNs are used to extract features from fine to
coarse scale and then from coarse to fine scale. The extracted features at each
scale are then combined and decoded to obtain the residuals between the input
and target poses. Intermediate supervisions are imposed on all the predicted
poses, which enforces the network to learn more representative features. Our
proposed approach is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets, i.e., the
Human3.6M dataset and the CMU Mocap dataset. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Code and

object-based, our new task masks out the names of people in captions in order
to encourage methods trained on such image-caption pairs to focus on contextual
cues (such as rich interactions between multiple people), rather than learning
associations between names and appearances. To facilitate this task, we
introduce a new dataset, Who&#x27;s Waldo, mined automatically from image-caption
data on Wikimedia Commons. We propose a Transformer-based method that
outperforms several strong baselines on this task, and are releasing our data
to the research community to spur work on contextual models that consider both
vision and language.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that
capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in
adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the
two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the
high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these
differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is
computed with \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme
brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to
non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.
This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales
and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These
qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision
tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and
dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP
on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its
performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7
box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the
potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical
design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP
architectures. The code and models are publicly available

                                        <span>Federated learning methods enable us to train machine learning models on
distributed user data while preserving its privacy. However, it is not always
feasible to obtain high-quality supervisory signals from users, especially for
vision tasks. Unlike typical federated settings with labeled client data, we
consider a more practical scenario where the distributed client data is
unlabeled, and a centralized labeled dataset is available on the server. We
further take the server-client and inter-client domain shifts into account and
pose a domain adaptation problem with one source (centralized server data) and
multiple targets (distributed client data). Within this new Federated
Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (FMTDA) task, we analyze the model performance
of exiting domain adaptation methods and propose an effective DualAdapt method
to address the new challenges. Extensive experimental results on image
classification and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our method
achieves high accuracy, incurs minimal communication cost, and requires low
computational resources on client devices.</span>

                                        <span>Solving the challenging problem of 3D object reconstruction from a single
image appropriately gives existing technologies the ability to perform with a
single monocular camera rather than requiring depth sensors. In recent years,
thanks to the development of deep learning, 3D reconstruction of a single image
has demonstrated impressive progress. Existing researches use Chamfer distance
as a loss function to guide the training of the neural network. However, the
Chamfer loss will give equal weights to all points inside the 3D point clouds.
It tends to sacrifice fine-grained and thin structures to avoid incurring a
high loss, which will lead to visually unsatisfactory results. This paper
proposes a framework that can recover a detailed three-dimensional point cloud
from a single image by focusing more on boundaries (edge and corner points).
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
techniques significantly, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and has fewer
training parameters.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce Mixture-based Feature Space Learning (MixtFSL) for obtaining a
rich and robust feature representation in the context of few-shot image
classification. Previous works have proposed to model each base class either
with a single point or with a mixture model by relying on offline clustering
algorithms. In contrast, we propose to model base classes with mixture models
by simultaneously training the feature extractor and learning the mixture model
parameters in an online manner. This results in a richer and more
discriminative feature space which can be employed to classify novel examples
from very few samples. Two main stages are proposed to train the MixtFSL model.
First, the multimodal mixtures for each base class and the feature extractor
parameters are learned using a combination of two loss functions. Second, the
resulting network and mixture models are progressively refined through a
leader-follower learning procedure, which uses the current estimate as a
&quot;target&quot; network. This target network is used to make a consistent assignment
of instances to mixture components, which increases performance and stabilizes
training. The effectiveness of our end-to-end feature space learning approach
is demonstrated with extensive experiments on four standard datasets and four
backbones. Notably, we demonstrate that when we combine our robust
representation with recent alignment-based approaches, we achieve new
state-of-the-art results in the inductive setting, with an absolute accuracy
for 5-shot classification of 82.45 on miniImageNet, 88.20 with tieredImageNet,
and 60.70 in FC100 using the ResNet-12 backbone.</span>

                                        <span>Dense video captioning aims to generate multiple associated captions with
their temporal locations from the video. Previous methods follow a
sophisticated &quot;localize-then-describe&quot; scheme, which heavily relies on numerous
hand-crafted components. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective
framework for end-to-end dense video captioning with parallel decoding (PDVC),
by formulating the dense caption generation as a set prediction task. In
practice, through stacking a newly proposed event counter on the top of a
transformer decoder, the PDVC precisely segments the video into a number of
event pieces under the holistic understanding of the video content, which
effectively increases the coherence and readability of predicted captions.
Compared with prior arts, the PDVC has several appealing advantages: (1)
Without relying on heuristic non-maximum suppression or a recurrent event
sequence selection network to remove redundancy, PDVC directly produces an
event set with an appropriate size; (2) In contrast to adopting the two-stage
scheme, we feed the enhanced representations of event queries into the
localization head and caption head in parallel, making these two sub-tasks
deeply interrelated and mutually promoted through the optimization; (3) Without
bells and whistles, extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2
show that PDVC is capable of producing high-quality captioning results,
surpassing the state-of-the-art two-stage methods when its localization
accuracy is on par with them. Code is available at

using the two-image views available on modern dual-pixel (DP) sensors. One
significant challenge in this line of research is access to DP data. Despite
many cameras having DP sensors, only a limited number provide access to the
low-level DP sensor images. In addition, capturing training data for defocus
deblurring involves a time-consuming and tedious setup requiring the camera&#x27;s
aperture to be adjusted. Some cameras with DP sensors (e.g., smartphones) do
not have adjustable apertures, further limiting the ability to produce the
necessary training data. We address the data capture bottleneck by proposing a
procedure to generate realistic DP data synthetically. Our synthesis approach
mimics the optical image formation found on DP sensors and can be applied to
virtual scenes rendered with standard computer software. Leveraging these
realistic synthetic DP images, we introduce a recurrent convolutional network
(RCN) architecture that improves deblurring results and is suitable for use
with single-frame and multi-frame data (e.g., video) captured by DP sensors.
Finally, we show that our synthetic DP data is useful for training DNN models
targeting video deblurring applications where access to DP data remains
challenging.</span>

high-frequency details and long-term temporal consistency. Extensive

training of an appearance adaptation network (AAN) that transforms images from
DS such that they look like images from DT. Together with the original label
maps from DS, the transformed images are used to adapt a DNN to DT. We propose
a joint training strategy of the AAN and the classifier, which constrains the
AAN to transform the images such that they are correctly classified. In this
way, objects of a certain class are changed such that they resemble objects of
the same class in DT. To further improve the adaptation performance, we propose
a new regularization loss for the discriminator network used in domain
adversarial training. We also address the problem of finding the optimal values
of the trained network parameters, proposing an unsupervised entropy based
parameter selection criterion which compensates for the fact that there is no
validation set in DT that could be monitored. As a minor contribution, we
present a new weighting strategy for the cross-entropy loss, addressing the
problem of imbalanced class distributions. Our method is evaluated in 42
adaptation scenarios using datasets from 7 cities, all consisting of
high-resolution digital orthophotos and height data. It achieves a positive
transfer in all cases, and on average it improves the performance in the target
domain by 4.3% in overall accuracy. In adaptation scenarios between datasets
from the ISPRS semantic labelling benchmark our method outperforms those from
recent publications by 10-20% with respect to the mean intersection over union.</span>

                                        <span>Depth completion aims to recover a dense depth map from a sparse depth map
with the corresponding color image as input. Recent approaches mainly formulate
depth completion as a one-stage end-to-end learning task, which outputs dense
depth maps directly. However, the feature extraction and supervision in
one-stage frameworks are insufficient, limiting the performance of these
approaches. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end residual
learning framework, which formulates the depth completion as a two-stage
learning task, i.e., a sparse-to-coarse stage and a coarse-to-fine stage.
First, a coarse dense depth map is obtained by a simple CNN framework. Then, a
refined depth map is further obtained using a residual learning strategy in the
coarse-to-fine stage with a coarse depth map and color image as input.
Specially, in the coarse-to-fine stage, a channel shuffle extraction operation
is utilized to extract more representative features from the color image and
coarse depth map, and an energy based fusion operation is exploited to
effectively fuse these features obtained by channel shuffle operation, thus
leading to more accurate and refined depth maps. We achieve SoTA performance in
RMSE on KITTI benchmark. Extensive experiments on other datasets future
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art depth
completion approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Since the introduction of modern deep learning methods for object pose
estimation, test accuracy and efficiency has increased significantly. For
training, however, large amounts of annotated training data are required for
good performance. While the use of synthetic training data prevents the need
for manual annotation, there is currently a large performance gap between
methods trained on real and synthetic data. This paper introduces a new method,
which bridges this gap.

Most methods trained on synthetic data use 2D images, as domain randomization
in 2D is more developed. To obtain precise poses, many of these methods perform
a final refinement using 3D data. Our method integrates the 3D data into the
network to increase the accuracy of the pose estimation. To allow for domain
randomization in 3D, a sensor-based data augmentation has been developed.
Additionally, we introduce the SparseEdge feature, which uses a wider search
space during point cloud propagation to avoid relying on specific features
without increasing run-time.

Experiments on three large pose estimation benchmarks show that the presented
method outperforms previous methods trained on synthetic data and achieves
comparable results to existing methods trained on real data.</span>

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted enormous research interest due
to temporal information processing capability, low power consumption, and high
biological plausibility. However, the formulation of efficient and
high-performance learning algorithms for SNNs is still challenging. Most
existing learning methods learn weights only, and require manual tuning of the
membrane-related parameters that determine the dynamics of a single spiking
neuron. These parameters are typically chosen to be the same for all neurons,
which limits the diversity of neurons and thus the expressiveness of the
resulting SNNs. In this paper, we take inspiration from the observation that
membrane-related parameters are different across brain regions, and propose a
training algorithm that is capable of learning not only the synaptic weights
but also the membrane time constants of SNNs. We show that incorporating
learnable membrane time constants can make the network less sensitive to
initial values and can speed up learning. In addition, we reevaluate the
pooling methods in SNNs and find that max-pooling will not lead to significant
information loss and have the advantage of low computation cost and binary
compatibility. We evaluate the proposed method for image classification tasks
on both traditional static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets, and
neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128 Gesture datasets. The experiment
results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy
on nearly all datasets, using fewer time-steps. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>In this paper, we present a conceptually simple, strong, and efficient
framework for fully- and weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation, called
Panoptic FCN. Our approach aims to represent and predict foreground things and
background stuff in a unified fully convolutional pipeline, which can be
optimized with point-based fully or weak supervision. In particular, Panoptic
FCN encodes each object instance or stuff category with the proposed kernel
generator and produces the prediction by convolving the high-resolution feature
directly. With this approach, instance-aware and semantically consistent
properties for things and stuff can be respectively satisfied in a simple
generate-kernel-then-segment workflow. Without extra boxes for localization or
instance separation, the proposed approach outperforms the previous box-based
and -free models with high efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a new form of
point-based annotation for weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation. It only
needs several random points for both things and stuff, which dramatically
reduces the annotation cost of human. The proposed Panoptic FCN is also proved
to have much superior performance in this weakly-supervised setting, which
achieves 82% of the fully-supervised performance with only 20 randomly
annotated points per instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of Panoptic FCN on COCO, VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and
Mapillary Vistas datasets. And it sets up a new leading benchmark for both
fully- and weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation. Our code and models are

chromosome, which is far from clinical practice. In this work, we propose a
detection based method, DeepACC, to locate and fine classify chromosomes
simultaneously based on the whole metaphase image. We firstly introduce the
Additive Angular Margin Loss to enhance the discriminative power of model. To
alleviate batch effects, we transform decision boundary of each class
case-by-case through a siamese network which make full use of prior knowledges
that chromosomes usually appear in pairs. Furthermore, we take the clinically
seven group criterion as a prior knowledge and design an additional Group
Inner-Adjacency Loss to further reduce inter-class similarities. 3390 metaphase
images from clinical laboratory are collected and labelled to evaluate the
performance. Results show that the new design brings encouraging performance
gains comparing to the state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

sound provides powerful self-supervisory signals for learning video
representations, which makes the ever-growing amount of online videos an
attractive source of training data. However, large portions of online videos
contain irrelevant audio-visual signals because of edited/overdubbed audio, and
models trained on such uncurated videos have shown to learn suboptimal
representations. Therefore, existing approaches rely almost exclusively on
datasets with predetermined taxonomies of semantic concepts, where there is a
high chance of audio-visual correspondence. Unfortunately, constructing such
datasets require labor intensive manual annotation and/or verification, which
severely limits the utility of online videos for large-scale learning. In this
work, we present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset
optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between
audio and visual channels in videos. We demonstrate that our approach finds
videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised
models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models
trained on existing manually curated datasets. The most significant benefit of
our approach is scalability: We release ACAV100M that contains 100 million
videos with high audio-visual correspondence, ideal for self-supervised video
representation learning.</span>

                                        <span>One-stage object detection is commonly implemented by optimizing two
sub-tasks: object classification and localization, using heads with two
parallel branches, which might lead to a certain level of spatial misalignment
in predictions between the two tasks. In this work, we propose a Task-aligned
One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that explicitly aligns the two tasks in a
learning-based manner. First, we design a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head)
which offers a better balance between learning task-interactive and
task-specific features, as well as a greater flexibility to learn the alignment
via a task-aligned predictor. Second, we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL)
to explicitly pull closer (or even unify) the optimal anchors for the two tasks
during training via a designed sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned
loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS-COCO, where TOOD achieves a
51.1 AP at single-model single-scale testing. This surpasses the recent
one-stage detectors by a large margin, such as ATSS (47.7 AP), GFL (48.2 AP),
and PAA (49.0 AP), with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Qualitative results also
demonstrate the effectiveness of TOOD for better aligning the tasks of object
classification and localization. Code is available at

across video clips. Efficiently exploiting multi-scale fine-grained features
while building the structural interaction among them is pivotal for its
success. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework, Dense Interaction
Learning (DenseIL), that takes the principal advantages of both CNN-based and
Attention-based architectures to tackle video-based person re-ID difficulties.
DenseIL contains a CNN encoder and a Dense Interaction (DI) decoder. The CNN
encoder is responsible for efficiently extracting discriminative spatial
features while the DI decoder is designed to densely model spatial-temporal
inherent interaction across frames. Different from previous works, we
additionally let the DI decoder densely attends to intermediate fine-grained
CNN features and that naturally yields multi-grained spatial-temporal
representation for each video clip. Moreover, we introduce Spatio-TEmporal
Positional Embedding (STEP-Emb) into the DI decoder to investigate the
positional relation among the spatial-temporal inputs. Our experiments
consistently and significantly outperform all the state-of-the-art methods on
multiple standard video-based person re-ID datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-view projection methods have demonstrated their ability to reach
state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape recognition. Those methods learn
different ways to aggregate information from multiple views. However, the
camera view-points for those views tend to be heuristically set and fixed for
all shapes. To circumvent the lack of dynamism of current multi-view methods,
we propose to learn those view-points. In particular, we introduce the
Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN) that regresses optimal view-points for
3D shape recognition, building upon advances in differentiable rendering. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end along with any multi-view network for 3D
shape classification. We integrate MVTN in a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that can render either 3D meshes or point clouds. MVTN exhibits clear
performance gains in the tasks of 3D shape classification and 3D shape
retrieval without the need for extra training supervision. In these tasks, MVTN
achieves state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet40, ShapeNet Core55, and the
most recent and realistic ScanObjectNN dataset (up to 6% improvement).
Interestingly, we also show that MVTN can provide network robustness against
rotation and occlusion in the 3D domain. The code is available at

                                        <span>Assessing action quality is challenging due to the subtle differences between
videos and large variations in scores. Most existing approaches tackle this
problem by regressing a quality score from a single video, suffering a lot from
the large inter-video score variations. In this paper, we show that the
relations among videos can provide important clues for more accurate action
quality assessment during both training and inference. Specifically, we
reformulate the problem of action quality assessment as regressing the relative
scores with reference to another video that has shared attributes (e.g.,
category and difficulty), instead of learning unreferenced scores. Following
this formulation, we propose a new Contrastive Regression (CoRe) framework to
learn the relative scores by pair-wise comparison, which highlights the
differences between videos and guides the models to learn the key hints for
assessment. In order to further exploit the relative information between two
videos, we devise a group-aware regression tree to convert the conventional
score regression into two easier sub-problems: coarse-to-fine classification
and regression in small intervals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRe, we
conduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AQA datasets including AQA-7,
MTL-AQA and JIGSAWS. Our approach outperforms previous methods by a large
margin and establishes new state-of-the-art on all three benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Privacy concerns around sharing personally identifiable information are a
major practical barrier to data sharing in medical research. However, in many
cases, researchers have no interest in a particular individual&#x27;s information
but rather aim to derive insights at the level of cohorts. Here, we utilize
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create derived medical imaging
datasets consisting entirely of synthetic patient data. The synthetic images
ideally have, in aggregate, similar statistical properties to those of a source
dataset but do not contain sensitive personal information. We assess the
quality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs
with 14 different radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans
with six types of intracranial hemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image
quality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either
the synthetic or the real dataset. We find that synthetic data performance
disproportionately benefits from a reduced number of unique label combinations.
Our open-source benchmark also indicates that at low number of samples per
class, label overfitting effects start to dominate GAN training. We
additionally conducted a reader study in which trained radiologists do not
perform better than random on discriminating between synthetic and real medical
images for intermediate levels of resolutions. In accordance with our benchmark
results, the classification accuracy of radiologists increases at higher
spatial resolution levels. Our study offers valuable guidelines and outlines
practical conditions under which insights derived from synthetic medical images
are similar to those that would have been derived from real imaging data. Our
results indicate that synthetic data sharing may be an attractive and
privacy-preserving alternative to sharing real patient-level data in the right
settings.</span>

                                        <span>3D point cloud understanding has made great progress in recent years.
However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets,
especially compared to 2D object detection tasks, since a large amount of labor
is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to
this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of
CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved
by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D
pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic
objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new
method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we
propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in
the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying
object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same
set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a
better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task.
Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on
several base models, especially when less training data are used, which
strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method.
Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic
data, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D
detection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D. We expect our attempt to provide
a new perspective for bridging object and scene-level 3D understanding.</span>

3D model of the geometry of an outdoor environment using a single monocular
camera attached to a moving vehicle. Dense models provide a rich representation
of the environment facilitating higher-level scene understanding, perception,
and planning. Our system employs dense depth prediction with a hybrid mapping
architecture combining state-of-the-art sparse features and dense fusion-based
visual SLAM algorithms within an integrated framework. Our novel contributions
include design of hybrid sparse-dense camera tracking and loop closure, and
scale estimation improvements in dense depth prediction. We use the motion
estimates from the sparse method to overcome the large and variable inter-frame
displacement typical of outdoor vehicle scenarios. Our system then registers
the live image with the dense model using whole-image alignment. This enables
the fusion of the live frame and dense depth prediction into the model. Global
consistency and alignment between the sparse and dense models are achieved by
applying pose constraints from the sparse method directly within the
deformation of the dense model. We provide qualitative and quantitative results
for both trajectory estimation and surface reconstruction accuracy,
demonstrating competitive performance on the KITTI dataset. Qualitative results
of the proposed approach are illustrated in https://youtu.be/Pn2uaVqjskY.

                                        <span>Remarkable results have been achieved by DCNN based self-supervised depth
estimation approaches. However, most of these approaches can only handle either
day-time or night-time images, while their performance degrades for all-day
images due to large domain shift and the variation of illumination between day
and night images. To relieve these limitations, we propose a domain-separated
network for self-supervised depth estimation of all-day images. Specifically,
to relieve the negative influence of disturbing terms (illumination, etc.), we
partition the information of day and night image pairs into two complementary
sub-spaces: private and invariant domains, where the former contains the unique
information (illumination, etc.) of day and night images and the latter
contains essential shared information (texture, etc.). Meanwhile, to guarantee
that the day and night images contain the same information, the
domain-separated network takes the day-time images and corresponding night-time
images (generated by GAN) as input, and the private and invariant feature
extractors are learned by orthogonality and similarity loss, where the domain
gap can be alleviated, thus better depth maps can be expected. Meanwhile, the
reconstruction and photometric losses are utilized to estimate complementary
information and depth maps effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation results for all-day
images on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset, proving the superiority of
our proposed approach.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised disentanglement learning is a crucial issue for understanding
and exploiting deep generative models. Recently, SeFa tries to find latent
disentangled directions by performing SVD on the first projection of a
pre-trained GAN. However, it is only applied to the first layer and works in a
post-processing way. Hessian Penalty minimizes the off-diagonal entries of the
output&#x27;s Hessian matrix to facilitate disentanglement, and can be applied to
multi-layers.However, it constrains each entry of output independently, making
it not sufficient in disentangling the latent directions (e.g., shape, size,
rotation, etc.) of spatially correlated variations. In this paper, we propose a
simple Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative
model to learn disentangled representations. It simply encourages the variation
of output caused by perturbations on different latent dimensions to be
orthogonal, and the Jacobian with respect to the input is calculated to
represent this variation. We show that our OroJaR also encourages the output&#x27;s
Hessian matrix to be diagonal in an indirect manner. In contrast to the Hessian
Penalty, our OroJaR constrains the output in a holistic way, making it very
effective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially
correlated variations. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show
that our method is effective in disentangled and controllable image generation,
and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

                                        <span>The study of 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction refers to the
inverse process of snapshot compressive imaging, during which the optical
system, e.g., the coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) system,
captures the 3D spatial-spectral signal and encodes it to a 2D measurement.
While numerous sophisticated neural networks have been elaborated for
end-to-end reconstruction, trade-offs still need to be made among performance,
efficiency (training and inference time), and feasibility (the ability of
restoring high resolution HSI on limited GPU memory). This raises a challenge
to design a new baseline to conjointly meet the above requirements. In this
paper, we fill in this blank by proposing a Spatial/Spectral Invariant Residual
U-Net, namely SSI-ResU-Net. It differentiates with U-Net in three folds--1)
scale/spectral-invariant learning, 2) nested residual learning, and 3)
computational efficiency. Benefiting from these three modules, the proposed
SSI-ResU-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art method TSA-Net by over 3
dB in PSNR and 0.036 in SSIM while only using 2.82% trainable parameters. To
the greatest extent, SSI-ResU-Net achieves competing performance with over
77.3% reduction in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), which for the
first time, makes high-resolution HSI reconstruction feasible under practical
application scenarios. Code and pre-trained models are made available at

detection in the wild. A speaker is considered active when his or her face is
visible and the voice is audible simultaneously. Although active speaker
detection is a crucial pre-processing step for many audio-visual tasks, there
is no existing dataset of natural human speech to evaluate the performance of
active speaker detection. We therefore curate the Active Speakers in the Wild
(ASW) dataset which contains videos and co-occurring speech segments with dense
speech activity labels. Videos and timestamps of audible segments are parsed
and adopted from VoxConverse, an existing speaker diarisation dataset that
consists of videos in the wild. Face tracks are extracted from the videos and
active segments are annotated based on the timestamps of VoxConverse in a
semi-automatic way. Two reference systems, a self-supervised system and a fully
supervised one, are evaluated on the dataset to provide the baseline
performances of ASW. Cross-domain evaluation is conducted in order to show the
negative effect of dubbed videos in the training data.</span>

                                        <span>We study self-supervised video representation learning, which is a
challenging task due to 1) lack of labels for explicit supervision; 2)
unstructured and noisy visual information. Existing methods mainly use
contrastive loss with video clips as the instances and learn visual
representation by discriminating instances from each other, but they need a
careful treatment of negative pairs by either relying on large batch sizes,
memory banks, extra modalities or customized mining strategies, which
inevitably includes noisy data. In this paper, we observe that the consistency
between positive samples is the key to learn robust video representation.
Specifically, we propose two tasks to learn the appearance and speed
consistency, respectively. The appearance consistency task aims to maximize the
similarity between two clips of the same video with different playback speeds.
The speed consistency task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips
with the same playback speed but different appearance information. We show that
optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on
downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition and video retrieval. Remarkably, for
action recognition on the UCF-101 dataset, we achieve 90.8\% accuracy without
using any extra modalities or negative pairs for unsupervised pretraining,
which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pretrained model. Codes and models
will be available.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has recently gained increased attention, as
a class of approaches that automatically searches in an input space of network
architectures. A crucial part of the NAS pipeline is the encoding of the
architecture that consists of the applied computational blocks, namely the
operations and the links between them. Most of the existing approaches either
fail to capture the structural properties of the architectures or use
hand-engineered vector to encode the operator information. In this paper, we
propose the replacement of fixed operator encoding with learnable
representations in the optimization process. This approach, which effectively
captures the relations of different operations, leads to smoother and more
accurate representations of the architectures and consequently to improved
performance of the end task. Our extensive evaluation in ENAS benchmark
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed operation embeddings to the
generation of highly accurate models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Finally, our method produces top-performing architectures that share similar
operation and graph patterns, highlighting a strong correlation between the
structural properties of the architecture and its performance.</span>

                                        <span>Vision Transformer (ViT) attains state-of-the-art performance in visual
recognition, and the variant, Local Vision Transformer, makes further
improvements. The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention,
performs the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local
attention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two
network regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well
as weight computation. Sparse connectivity: there is no connection across
channels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local
window. Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared
across channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the
connection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance.
We point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its
dynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight
sharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights)
across spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on
depth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation
complexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin
Transformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet
classification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation. These
observations suggest that Local Vision Transformer takes advantage of two
regularization forms and dynamic weight to increase the network capacity.</span>

performance drop, when the distribution of the training data is severely
skewed. In this paper, we propose to use the mean classification score to
indicate the classification accuracy for each category during training. Based
on this indicator, we balance the classification via an Equilibrium Loss (EBL)
and a Memory-augmented Feature Sampling (MFS) method. Specifically, EBL
increases the intensity of the adjustment of the decision boundary for the weak
classes by a designed score-guided loss margin between any two classes. On the
other hand, MFS improves the frequency and accuracy of the adjustment of the
decision boundary for the weak classes through over-sampling the instance
features of those classes. Therefore, EBL and MFS work collaboratively for
finding the classification equilibrium in long-tailed detection, and
dramatically improve the performance of tail classes while maintaining or even
improving the performance of head classes. We conduct experiments on LVIS using
Mask R-CNN with various backbones including ResNet-50-FPN and ResNet-101-FPN to
show the superiority of the proposed method. It improves the detection
performance of tail classes by 15.6 AP, and outperforms the most recent
long-tailed object detectors by more than 1 AP. Code is available at

                                        <span>High quality facial image editing is a challenging problem in the movie
post-production industry, requiring a high degree of control and identity
preservation. Previous works that attempt to tackle this problem may suffer
from the entanglement of facial attributes and the loss of the person&#x27;s
identity. Furthermore, many algorithms are limited to a certain task. To tackle
these limitations, we propose to edit facial attributes via the latent space of
a StyleGAN generator, by training a dedicated latent transformation network and
incorporating explicit disentanglement and identity preservation terms in the
loss function. We further introduce a pipeline to generalize our face editing
to videos. Our model achieves a disentangled, controllable, and
identity-preserving facial attribute editing, even in the challenging case of
real (i.e., non-synthetic) images and videos. We conduct extensive experiments
on image and video datasets and show that our model outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and quantitative evaluation. Source

2D-to-3D pose estimation problem. While the average prediction accuracy has
been improved significantly over the years, the performance on hard poses with
depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex or rare poses is still far from
satisfactory. In this work, we target these hard poses and present a novel
skeletal GNN learning solution. To be specific, we propose a hop-aware
hierarchical channel-squeezing fusion layer to effectively extract relevant
information from neighboring nodes while suppressing undesired noises in GNN
learning. In addition, we propose a temporal-aware dynamic graph construction
procedure that is robust and effective for 3D pose estimation. Experimental
results on the Human3.6M dataset show that our solution achieves 10.3\% average
prediction accuracy improvement and greatly improves on hard poses over
state-of-the-art techniques. We further apply the proposed technique on the
skeleton-based action recognition task and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

                                        <span>We introduce a method to render Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in real time
using PlenOctrees, an octree-based 3D representation which supports
view-dependent effects. Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150
FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without
sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform
free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent
effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a
PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,
we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical
harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input
to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly
optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or
better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree
optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need
to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering
approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and
product visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems. PlenOctrees
are amenable to in-browser rendering as well; please visit the project page for
the interactive online demo, as well as video and code:

Inspired by recent developments in vision transformers, we ditch the standard
approach in video action recognition that relies on 3D ConvNets and introduce a
method that classifies actions by attending to the entire video sequence
information. Our approach is generic and builds on top of any given 2D spatial
network. In terms of wall runtime, it trains $16.1\times$ faster and runs
$5.1\times$ faster during inference while maintaining competitive accuracy
compared to other state-of-the-art methods. It enables whole video analysis,
via a single end-to-end pass, while requiring $1.5\times$ fewer GFLOPs. We
report competitive results on Kinetics-400 and present an ablation study of VTN
properties and the trade-off between accuracy and inference speed. We hope our
approach will serve as a new baseline and start a fresh line of research in the
video recognition domain. Code and models are available at:

                                        <span>Fruit flies are established model systems for studying olfactory learning as
they will readily learn to associate odors with both electric shock or sugar
rewards. The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor
learning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are
received by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of
each odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these
glomeruli then project its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000
so-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom
body (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neuropils
that decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown
that there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and
thus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to
fingerprints~-- even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging
insights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural
network that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input
layer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden
layer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization
algorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural
limits by searching a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception
tasks that predict perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet
outperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For
image-classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark
datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation
methods or convolutional layers and shows particularly fast running time. Thus,
neural networks inspired by the insect brain can be both economical and perform
well.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, image captioning has aroused great interest in both academic and
industrial worlds. Most existing systems are built upon large-scale datasets
consisting of image-sentence pairs, which, however, are time-consuming to
construct. In addition, even for the most advanced image captioning systems, it
is still difficult to realize deep image understanding. In this work, we
achieve unpaired image captioning by bridging the vision and the language
domains with high-level semantic information. The motivation stems from the
fact that the semantic concepts with the same modality can be extracted from
both images and descriptions. To further improve the quality of captions
generated by the model, we propose the Semantic Relationship Explorer, which
explores the relationships between semantic concepts for better understanding
of the image. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO dataset show that we can generate
desirable captions without paired datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach
boosts five strong baselines under the paired setting, where the most
significant improvement in CIDEr score reaches 8%, demonstrating that it is
effective and generalizes well to a wide range of models.</span>

not known at training time. In order to recognize new categories, the
classifier has to project the input samples of known classes in very compact
and separated regions of the features space for discriminating samples of
unknown classes. Recently proposed Capsule Networks have shown to outperform
alternatives in many fields, particularly in image recognition, however they
have not been fully applied yet to open-set recognition. In capsule networks,
scalar neurons are replaced by capsule vectors or matrices, whose entries
represent different properties of objects. In our proposal, during training,
capsules features of the same known class are encouraged to match a pre-defined
gaussian, one for each class. To this end, we use the variational autoencoder
framework, with a set of gaussian priors as the approximation for the posterior
distribution. In this way, we are able to control the compactness of the
features of the same class around the center of the gaussians, thus controlling
the ability of the classifier in detecting samples from unknown classes. We
conducted several experiments and ablation of our model, obtaining state of the
art results on different datasets in the open set recognition and unknown
detection tasks.</span>

spatial and semantic cues to efficiently achieve their navigation goals.
Towards equipping computational agents with similar capabilities, we introduce
Pathdreamer, a visual world model for agents navigating in novel indoor
environments. Given one or more previous visual observations, Pathdreamer
generates plausible high-resolution 360 visual observations (RGB, semantic
segmentation and depth) for viewpoints that have not been visited, in buildings
not seen during training. In regions of high uncertainty (e.g. predicting
around corners, imagining the contents of an unseen room), Pathdreamer can
predict diverse scenes, allowing an agent to sample multiple realistic outcomes
for a given trajectory. We demonstrate that Pathdreamer encodes useful and
accessible visual, spatial and semantic knowledge about human environments by
using it in the downstream task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN).
Specifically, we show that planning ahead with Pathdreamer brings about half
the benefit of looking ahead at actual observations from unobserved parts of
the environment. We hope that Pathdreamer will help unlock model-based
approaches to challenging embodied navigation tasks such as navigating to
specified objects and VLN.</span>

                                        <span>With the renaissance of deep learning, automatic diagnostic systems for
computed tomography (CT) have achieved many successful applications. However,
they are mostly attributed to careful expert annotations, which are often
scarce in practice. This drives our interest to the unsupervised representation
learning. Recent studies have shown that self-supervised learning is an
effective approach for learning representations, but most of them rely on the
empirical design of transformations and pretext tasks. To avoid the
subjectivity associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel
unsupervised three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a
transformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations
to collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is
learned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D
lesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We
evaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the
embedding layer. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55%), LNDb (77.69%) and
TianChi (79.96%) datasets for unsupervised representation learning. When
fine-tuned on 10% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to the
supervised learning model (89.46% vs. 85.03%, 73.85% vs. 73.44%, 83.56% vs.
83.34% on the three datasets, respectively), indicating the superiority of
MVCNet in learning representations with limited annotations. Code is released

                                        <span>Despite the great progress of person re-identification (ReID) with the
adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks, current ReID models are opaque and
only outputs a scalar distance between two persons. There are few methods
providing users semantically understandable explanations for why two persons
are the same one or not. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc method, named
Attribute-guided Metric Distillation (AMD), to explain existing ReID models.
This is the first method to explore attributes to answer: 1) what and where the
attributes make two persons different, and 2) how much each attribute
contributes to the difference. In AMD, we design a pluggable interpreter
network for target models to generate quantitative contributions of attributes
and visualize accurate attention maps of the most discriminative attributes. To
achieve this goal, we propose a metric distillation loss by which the
interpreter learns to decompose the distance of two persons into components of
attributes with knowledge distilled from the target model. Moreover, we propose
an attribute prior loss to make the interpreter generate attribute-guided
attention maps and to eliminate biases caused by the imbalanced distribution of
attributes. This loss can guide the interpreter to focus on the exclusive and
discriminative attributes rather than the large-area but common attributes of
two persons. Comprehensive experiments show that the interpreter can generate
effective and intuitive explanations for varied models and generalize well
under cross-domain settings. As a by-product, the accuracy of target models can
be further improved with our interpreter.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we investigate the knowledge distillation (KD) strategy for
object detection and propose an effective framework applicable to both
homogeneous and heterogeneous student-teacher pairs. The conventional feature
imitation paradigm introduces imitation masks to focus on informative
foreground areas while excluding the background noises. However, we find that
those methods fail to fully utilize the semantic information in all feature
pyramid levels, which leads to inefficiency for knowledge distillation between
FPN-based detectors. To this end, we propose a novel semantic-guided feature
imitation technique, which automatically performs soft matching between feature
pairs across all pyramid levels to provide the optimal guidance to the student.
To push the envelop even further, we introduce contrastive distillation to
effectively capture the information encoded in the relationship between
different feature regions. Finally, we propose a generalized detection KD
pipeline, which is capable of distilling both homogeneous and heterogeneous
detector pairs. Our method consistently outperforms the existing detection KD
techniques, and works when (1) components in the framework are used separately
and in conjunction; (2) for both homogeneous and heterogenous student-teacher
pairs and (3) on multiple detection benchmarks. With a powerful
X101-FasterRCNN-Instaboost detector as the teacher, R50-FasterRCNN reaches
44.0% AP, R50-RetinaNet reaches 43.3% AP and R50-FCOS reaches 43.1% AP on COCO

structure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research.
Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic
table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis
community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it
remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a
variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a
table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different
table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table
cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the
table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition
as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table
graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.
Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection
branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial
location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on
three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph
annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
TGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made
publicly available.</span>

community. In this paper, we propose a new approach to image co-segmentation
through introducing the dense connections into the decoder path of Siamese
U-net and presenting a new edge enhanced 3D IOU loss measured over distance
maps. Considering the rigorous mapping between the signed normalized distance
map (SNDM) and the binary segmentation mask, we estimate the SNDMs directly
from original images and use them to determine the segmentation results. We
apply the Siamese U-net for solving this problem and improve its effectiveness
by densely connecting each layer with subsequent layers in the decoder path.
Furthermore, a new learning loss is designed to measure the 3D intersection
over union (IOU) between the generated SNDMs and the labeled SNDMs. The
experimental results on commonly used datasets for image co-segmentation
demonstrate the effectiveness of our presented dense structure and edge

significantly deviate from normal appearance. Recent surface anomaly detection
methods rely on generative models to accurately reconstruct the normal areas
and to fail on anomalies. These methods are trained only on anomaly-free
images, and often require hand-crafted post-processing steps to localize the
anomalies, which prohibits optimizing the feature extraction for maximal
detection capability. In addition to reconstructive approach, we cast surface
anomaly detection primarily as a discriminative problem and propose a
discriminatively trained reconstruction anomaly embedding model (DRAEM). The
proposed method learns a joint representation of an anomalous image and its
anomaly-free reconstruction, while simultaneously learning a decision boundary
between normal and anomalous examples. The method enables direct anomaly
localization without the need for additional complicated post-processing of the
network output and can be trained using simple and general anomaly simulations.
On the challenging MVTec anomaly detection dataset, DRAEM outperforms the
current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin and even
delivers detection performance close to the fully-supervised methods on the
widely used DAGM surface-defect detection dataset, while substantially
outperforming them in localization accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR) aims at reconstructing
high-resolution LF images from their low-resolution counterparts. Although
CNN-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in LF image SR, these
methods cannot fully model the non-local properties of the 4D LF data. In this
paper, we propose a simple but effective Transformer-based method for LF image
SR. In our method, an angular Transformer is designed to incorporate
complementary information among different views, and a spatial Transformer is
developed to capture both local and long-range dependencies within each
sub-aperture image. With the proposed angular and spatial Transformers, the
beneficial information in an LF can be fully exploited and the SR performance
is boosted. We validate the effectiveness of our angular and spatial
Transformers through extensive ablation studies, and compare our method to
recent state-of-the-art methods on five public LF datasets. Our method achieves
superior SR performance with a small model size and low computational cost.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial robustness has attracted extensive studies recently by revealing
the vulnerability and intrinsic characteristics of deep networks. However,
existing works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets,
while real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push
adversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we
investigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed
distributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by
imbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness,
uncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a
systematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction
with the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are
obtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of
robust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error
limits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose
a clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated
modules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin
engineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other
state-of-the-art defense methods. To our best knowledge, we are the first to
tackle adversarial robustness under long-tailed distributions, which we believe
would be a significant step towards real-world robustness. Our code is

is the starting point for designing and implementing any traffic management
strategy. Hence, traffic operators and users of a transportation network can
make reliable decisions such as influence/change route or mode choice. However,
the problem of traffic state estimation from various sensors within an urban
environment is very complex for several different reasons, such as availability
of sensors, different noise levels, different output quantities, sensor
accuracy, heterogeneous data fusion, and many more. To provide a better
understanding of this problem, we organized an experimental campaign with video
measurement in an area within the urban network of Zurich, Switzerland. We
focus on capturing the traffic state in terms of traffic flow and travel times
by ensuring measurements from established thermal cameras by the city&#x27;s
authorities, processed video data, and the Google Distance Matrix. We assess
the different data sources, and we propose a simple yet efficient Multiple
Linear Regression (MLR) model to estimate travel times with fusion of various

of supervised neural networks on synthetic data by features from real-world
data. The process involves a series of linear operations on the input features
to the NN model, whether they are from the source or target domains, as
follows: 1) A cross-correlation of the input data (i.e. images) with a randomly
picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images from that domain or the mean of
all randomly picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images. 2) The convolution
of the resulting data with the mean of the autocorrelated input images from the
other domain. In the training stage, as expected, the input images are from the
source domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from the
target domain. In the inference/application stage, the input images are from
the target domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from
the source domain. The proposed method only manipulates the data from the
source and target domains and does not explicitly interfere with the training
workflow and network architecture. An application that includes training a
convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset and testing the network on
the MNIST-M dataset achieves a 70% accuracy on the test data. A principal
component analysis (PCA), as well as t-SNE, show that the input features from
the source and target domains, after the proposed direct transformations, share
similar properties along with the principal components as compared to the
original MNIST and MNIST-M input features.</span>

                                        <span>A large gap exists between fully-supervised object detection and
weakly-supervised object detection. To narrow this gap, some methods consider
knowledge transfer from additional fully-supervised dataset. But these methods
do not fully exploit discriminative category information in the
fully-supervised dataset, thus causing low mAP. To solve this issue, we propose
a novel category transfer framework for weakly supervised object detection. The
intuition is to fully leverage both visually-discriminative and
semantically-correlated category information in the fully-supervised dataset to
enhance the object-classification ability of a weakly-supervised detector. To
handle overlapping category transfer, we propose a double-supervision mean
teacher to gather common category information and bridge the domain gap between
two datasets. To handle non-overlapping category transfer, we propose a
semantic graph convolutional network to promote the aggregation of semantic
features between correlated categories. Experiments are conducted with Pascal
VOC 2007 as the target weakly-supervised dataset and COCO as the source
fully-supervised dataset. Our category transfer framework achieves 63.5% mAP
and 80.3% CorLoc with 5 overlapping categories between two datasets, which
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Codes are avaliable at

by conditioning each sequence element on the previous ones, or 2. directly
produce an output sequences in parallel. While research has mostly explored
upon this difference on sequential tasks in NLP, we study the difference
between auto-regressive and parallel prediction on visual set prediction tasks,
and in particular on polygonal shapes in images because polygons are
representative of numerous types of objects, such as buildings or obstacles for
aerial vehicles. This is challenging for deep learning architectures as a
polygon can consist of a varying carnality of points. We provide evidence on
the importance of natural orders for Transformers, and show the benefit of
decomposing complex polygons into collections of points in an auto-regressive
manner.</span>

                                        <span>In spite of its extensive adaptation in almost every medical diagnostic and
examinatorial application, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is still a slow
imaging modality which limits its use for dynamic imaging. In recent years,
Parallel Imaging (PI) and Compressed Sensing (CS) have been utilised to
accelerate the MRI acquisition. In clinical settings, subsampling the k-space
measurements during scanning time using Cartesian trajectories, such as
rectilinear sampling, is currently the most conventional CS approach applied
which, however, is prone to producing aliased reconstructions. With the advent
of the involvement of Deep Learning (DL) in accelerating the MRI,
reconstructing faithful images from subsampled data became increasingly
promising. Retrospectively applying a subsampling mask onto the k-space data is
a way of simulating the accelerated acquisition of k-space data in real
clinical setting. In this paper we compare and provide a review for the effect
of applying either rectilinear or radial retrospective subsampling on the
quality of the reconstructions outputted by trained deep neural networks. With
the same choice of hyper-parameters, we train and evaluate two distinct
Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), one for each type of subsampling. The
qualitative and quantitative results of our experiments indicate that the model
trained on data with radial subsampling attains higher performance and learns
to estimate reconstructions with higher fidelity paving the way for other DL
approaches to involve radial subsampling.</span>

computed tomography (CT) studies under varied clinical scenarios, e.g., fully
dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) studies, non-contrast (NC) plus venous phase
(VP) abdominal studies, or NC-only studies. We develop a flexible
three-dimensional deep algorithm, called hetero-phase volumetric detection
(HPVD), that can accept any combination of contrast-phase inputs and with
adjustable sensitivity depending on the clinical purpose. We trained HPVD on
771 DCE CT scans to detect HCCs and tested on external 164 positives and 206
controls, respectively. We compare performance against six clinical readers,
including two radiologists, two hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) surgeons, and
two hepatologists. The area under curve (AUC) of the localization receiver
operating characteristic (LROC) for NC-only, NC plus VP, and full DCE CT
yielded 0.71, 0.81, 0.89 respectively. At a high sensitivity operating point of
80% on DCE CT, HPVD achieved 97% specificity, which is comparable to measured
physician performance. We also demonstrate performance improvements over more
typical and less flexible non hetero-phase detectors. Thus, we demonstrate that
a single deep learning algorithm can be effectively applied to diverse HCC
detection clinical scenarios.</span>

images usually have better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and richer textures due
to its higher quantum efficiency. It is thus natural to apply a mono-color
dual-camera system to restore color images with higher visual quality. In this
paper, we propose a mono-color image enhancement algorithm that colorizes the
monochrome image with the color one. Based on the assumption that adjacent
structures with similar luminance values are likely to have similar colors, we
first perform dense scribbling to assign colors to the monochrome pixels
through block matching. Two types of outliers, including occlusion and color
ambiguity, are detected and removed from the initial scribbles. We also
introduce a sampling strategy to accelerate the scribbling process. Then, the
dense scribbles are propagated to the entire image. To alleviate incorrect
color propagation in the regions that have no color hints at all, we generate
extra color seeds based on the existed scribbles to guide the propagation
process. Experimental results show that, our algorithm can efficiently restore
color images with higher SNR and richer details from the mono-color image
pairs, and achieves good performance in solving the color bleeding problem.</span>

                                        <span>Instance segmentation in 3D scenes is fundamental in many applications of
scene understanding. It is yet challenging due to the compound factors of data
irregularity and uncertainty in the numbers of instances. State-of-the-art
methods largely rely on a general pipeline that first learns point-wise
features discriminative at semantic and instance levels, followed by a separate
step of point grouping for proposing object instances. While promising, they
have the shortcomings that (1) the second step is not supervised by the main
objective of instance segmentation, and (2) their point-wise feature learning
and grouping are less effective to deal with data irregularities, possibly
resulting in fragmented segmentations. To address these issues, we propose in
this work an end-to-end solution of Semantic Superpoint Tree Network (SSTNet)
for proposing object instances from scene points. Key in SSTNet is an
intermediate, semantic superpoint tree (SST), which is constructed based on the
learned semantic features of superpoints, and which will be traversed and split
at intermediate tree nodes for proposals of object instances. We also design in
SSTNet a refinement module, termed CliqueNet, to prune superpoints that may be
wrongly grouped into instance proposals. Experiments on the benchmarks of
ScanNet and S3DIS show the efficacy of our proposed method. At the time of
submission, SSTNet ranks top on the ScanNet (V2) leaderboard, with 2% higher of
mAP than the second best method. The source code in PyTorch is available at
https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/SSTNet.</span>

try-on methods have made great progress. However, limited work has explored the
task of video-based virtual try-on while it is important in real-world
applications. Most existing video-based virtual try-on methods usually require
clothing templates and they can only generate blurred and low-resolution
results. To address these challenges, we propose a Memory-based Video virtual
Try-On Network (MV-TON), which seamlessly transfers desired clothes to a target
person without using any clothing templates and generates high-resolution
realistic videos. Specifically, MV-TON consists of two modules: 1) a try-on
module that transfers the desired clothes from model images to frame images by
pose alignment and region-wise replacing of pixels; 2) a memory refinement
module that learns to embed the existing generated frames into the latent space
as external memory for the following frame generation. Experimental results
show the effectiveness of our method in the video virtual try-on task and its
superiority over other existing methods.</span>

wildlife conservation. Recent models are generally based on deep learning and
thus require vast amounts of training data. Due to their scarcity and minuscule
size, annotating animals in aerial imagery is a highly tedious process. In this
project, we present a methodology to reduce the amount of required training
data by resorting to self-supervised pretraining. In detail, we examine a
combination of recent contrastive learning methodologies like Momentum Contrast
(MoCo) and Cross-Level Instance-Group Discrimination (CLD) to condition our
model on the aerial images without the requirement for labels. We show that a
combination of MoCo, CLD, and geometric augmentations outperforms conventional
models pre-trained on ImageNet by a large margin. Crucially, our method still
yields favorable results even if we reduce the number of training animals to
just 10%, at which point our best model scores double the recall of the
baseline at similar precision. This effectively allows reducing the number of
required annotations to a fraction while still being able to train
high-accuracy models in such highly challenging settings.</span>

Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM). PR-RRN consists of Residual-Recursive Networks
(RRN) and two extra regularization losses. RRN is designed to effectively
recover 3D shape and camera from 2D keypoints with novel residual-recursive
structure. As NRSfM is a highly under-constrained problem, we propose two new
pairwise regularization to further regularize the reconstruction. The
Rigidity-based Pairwise Contrastive Loss regularizes the shape representation
by encouraging higher similarity between the representations of high-rigidity
pairs of frames than low-rigidity pairs. We propose minimum singular-value
ratio to measure the pairwise rigidity. The Pairwise Consistency Loss enforces
the reconstruction to be consistent when the estimated shapes and cameras are
exchanged between pairs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on

                                        <span>With the strength of deep generative models, 3D pose transfer regains
intensive research interests in recent years. Existing methods mainly rely on a
variety of constraints to achieve the pose transfer over 3D meshes, e.g., the
need for the manually encoding for shape and pose disentanglement. In this
paper, we present an unsupervised approach to conduct the pose transfer between
any arbitrate given 3D meshes. Specifically, a novel Intrinsic-Extrinsic
Preserved Generative Adversarial Network (IEP-GAN) is presented for both
intrinsic (i.e., shape) and extrinsic (i.e., pose) information preservation.
Extrinsically, we propose a co-occurrence discriminator to capture the
structural/pose invariance from distinct Laplacians of the mesh. Meanwhile,
intrinsically, a local intrinsic-preserved loss is introduced to preserve the
geodesic priors while avoiding the heavy computations. At last, we show the
possibility of using IEP-GAN to manipulate 3D human meshes in various ways,
including pose transfer, identity swapping and pose interpolation with latent
code vector arithmetic. The extensive experiments on various 3D datasets of
humans, animals and hands qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the
generality of our approach. Our proposed model produces better results and is
substantially more efficient compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. Code

the image a person has in mind into a photofit (facial composite). Our method
combines three neural networks: An encoder, a scoring network, and a decoder.
The encoder extracts image features and predicts a neural activation map for
each face looked at by a human observer. A neural scoring network compares the
human and neural attention and predicts a relevance score for each extracted
image feature. Finally, image features are aggregated into a single feature
vector as a linear combination of all features weighted by relevance which a
decoder decodes into the final photofit. We train the neural scoring network on
a novel dataset containing gaze data of 19 participants looking at collages of

                                        <span>Camera and 3D LiDAR sensors have become indispensable devices in modern
autonomous driving vehicles, where the camera provides the fine-grained
texture, color information in 2D space and LiDAR captures more precise and
farther-away distance measurements of the surrounding environments. The
complementary information from these two sensors makes the two-modality fusion
be a desired option. However, two major issues of the fusion between camera and
LiDAR hinder its performance, \ie, how to effectively fuse these two modalities
and how to precisely align them (suffering from the weak spatiotemporal
synchronization problem). In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine LiDAR and
camera fusion-based network (termed as LIF-Seg) for LiDAR segmentation. For the
first issue, unlike these previous works fusing the point cloud and image
information in a one-to-one manner, the proposed method fully utilizes the
contextual information of images and introduces a simple but effective
early-fusion strategy. Second, due to the weak spatiotemporal synchronization
problem, an offset rectification approach is designed to align these
two-modality features. The cooperation of these two components leads to the
success of the effective camera-LiDAR fusion. Experimental results on the
nuScenes dataset show the superiority of the proposed LIF-Seg over existing
methods with a large margin. Ablation studies and analyses demonstrate that our
proposed LIF-Seg can effectively tackle the weak spatiotemporal synchronization
problem.</span>

and understand convolutional neural networks. However, exploiting these visual
explanations during the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) is
an unexplored area in computer vision research. Indeed, we argue that this kind
of information can be used to influence GANs training in a positive way. For
this reason, in this paper, it is shown how gradient based attentions can be
used as knowledge to be conveyed in a teacher-student paradigm for multi-domain
image-to-image translation tasks in order to improve the results of the student
architecture. Further, it is demonstrated how &quot;pseudo&quot;-attentions can also be
employed during training when teacher and student networks are trained on
different domains which share some similarities. The approach is validated on
multi-domain facial attributes transfer and human expression synthesis showing
both qualitative and quantitative results.</span>

suffers from inaccurate coverage of object areas during the generation of the
pseudo groundtruth. This is because the object activation maps are trained with
the classification objective and lack the ability to generalize. To improve the
generality of the objective activation maps, we propose a region prototypical
network RPNet to explore the cross-image object diversity of the training set.
Similar object parts across images are identified via region feature
comparison. Object confidence is propagated between regions to discover new
object areas while background regions are suppressed. Experiments show that the
proposed method generates more complete and accurate pseudo object masks, while
achieving state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO. In

effect of the non-straight particle trajectory, because it seems to be
impossible to obtain the curvature information from a pair of particle images.
As a result, the computed vector underestimates the real velocity due to the
straight-line approximation, that further causes a systematic error for the PIV
instrument. In this work, the particle curved trajectory between two recordings
is firstly explained with the streamline segment of a steady flow
(diffeomorphic transformation) instead of a single vector, and this idea is
termed as diffeomorphic PIV. Specifically, a deformation field is introduced to
describe the particle displacement, i.e., we try to find the optimal velocity
field, of which the corresponding deformation vector field agrees with the
particle displacement. Because the variation of the deformation function can be
approximated with the variation of the velocity function, the diffeomorphic PIV
can be implemented as iterative PIV. That says, the diffeomorphic PIV warps the
images with deformation vector field instead of the velocity, and keeps the
rest as same as iterative PIVs. Two diffeomorphic deformation schemes --
forward diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (FDDI) and central
diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (CDDI) -- are proposed. Tested on
synthetic images, the FDDI achieves significant accuracy improvement across
different one-pass displacement estimators (cross-correlation, optical flow,
deep learning flow). Besides, the results on three real PIV image pairs
demonstrate the non-negligible curvature effect for CDI-based PIV, and our FDDI
provides larger velocity estimation (more accurate) in the fast curvy
streamline areas. The accuracy improvement of the combination of FDDI and
accurate dense estimator means that our diffeomorphic PIV paves a new way for
complex flow measurement.</span>

                                        <span>We address the problem of visible-infrared person re-identification
(VI-reID), that is, retrieving a set of person images, captured by visible or
infrared cameras, in a cross-modal setting. Two main challenges in VI-reID are
intra-class variations across person images, and cross-modal discrepancies
between visible and infrared images. Assuming that the person images are
roughly aligned, previous approaches attempt to learn coarse image- or rigid
part-level person representations that are discriminative and generalizable
across different modalities. However, the person images, typically cropped by
off-the-shelf object detectors, are not necessarily well-aligned, which
distract discriminative person representation learning. In this paper, we
introduce a novel feature learning framework that addresses these problems in a
unified way. To this end, we propose to exploit dense correspondences between
cross-modal person images. This allows to address the cross-modal discrepancies
in a pixel-level, suppressing modality-related features from person
representations more effectively. This also encourages pixel-wise associations
between cross-modal local features, further facilitating discriminative feature
learning for VI-reID. Extensive experiments and analyses on standard VI-reID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly
outperforms the state of the art.</span>

                                        <span>Data labeling in supervised learning is considered an expensive and
infeasible tool in some conditions. The self-supervised learning method is
proposed to tackle the learning effectiveness with fewer labeled data, however,
there is a lack of confidence in the size of labeled data needed to achieve
adequate results. This study aims to draw a baseline on the proportion of the
labeled data that models can appreciate to yield competent accuracy when
compared to training with additional labels. The study implements the
kaggle.com&#x27; cats-vs-dogs dataset, Mnist and Fashion-Mnist to investigate the
self-supervised learning task by implementing random rotations augmentation on
the original datasets. To reveal the true effectiveness of the pretext process
in self-supervised learning, the original dataset is divided into smaller
batches, and learning is repeated on each batch with and without the pretext
pre-training. Results show that the pretext process in the self-supervised
learning improves the accuracy around 15% in the downstream classification task
when compared to the plain supervised learning.</span>

                                        <span>The crux of self-supervised video representation learning is to build general
features from unlabeled videos. However, most recent works have mainly focused
on high-level semantics and neglected lower-level representations and their
temporal relationship which are crucial for general video understanding. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature
optimization framework to improve the generalization and temporal modeling
ability of learned video representations. Concretely, high-level features
obtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build
distribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature
learning. We also devise a simple temporal modeling module from multi-level
features to enhance motion pattern learning. Experiments demonstrate that
multi-level feature optimization with the graph constraint and temporal
modeling can greatly improve the representation ability in video understanding.

                                        <span>Automatic augmentation methods have recently become a crucial pillar for
strong model performance in vision tasks. While existing automatic augmentation
methods need to trade off simplicity, cost and performance, we present a most
simple baseline, TrivialAugment, that outperforms previous methods for almost
free. TrivialAugment is parameter-free and only applies a single augmentation
to each image. Thus, TrivialAugment&#x27;s effectiveness is very unexpected to us
and we performed very thorough experiments to study its performance. First, we
compare TrivialAugment to previous state-of-the-art methods in a variety of
image classification scenarios. Then, we perform multiple ablation studies with
different augmentation spaces, augmentation methods and setups to understand
the crucial requirements for its performance. Additionally, we provide a simple
interface to facilitate the widespread adoption of automatic augmentation
methods, as well as our full code base for reproducibility. Since our work
reveals a stagnation in many parts of automatic augmentation research, we end
with a short proposal of best practices for sustained future progress in
automatic augmentation methods.</span>

in synthetic biological research. Modeling TLFM experiments based on real data
may enable researchers to repeat certain experiments with minor effort. This
thesis is a study towards deep learning-based modeling of TLFM experiments on
the image level. The modeling of TLFM experiments, by way of the example of
trapped yeast cells, is split into two tasks. The first task is to generate
synthetic image data based on real image data. To approach this problem, a
novel generative adversarial network, for conditionalized and unconditionalized
image generation, is proposed. The second task is the simulation of brightfield
microscopy images over multiple discrete time-steps. To tackle this simulation
task an advanced future frame prediction model is introduced. The proposed
models are trained and tested on a novel dataset that is presented in this
thesis. The obtained results showed that the modeling of TLFM experiments, with
deep learning, is a proper approach, but requires future research to

detection. Such objects are highly blurred and move over large distances within
one video frame. Fast moving objects are associated with a deblurring and
matting problem, also called deblatting. We show that the separation of
deblatting into consecutive matting and deblurring allows achieving real-time
performance, i.e. an order of magnitude speed-up, and thus enabling new classes
of application. The proposed method detects fast moving objects as a truncated
distance function to the trajectory by learning from synthetic data. For the
sharp appearance estimation and accurate trajectory estimation, we propose a
matting and fitting network that estimates the blurred appearance without
background, followed by an energy minimization based deblurring. The
state-of-the-art methods are outperformed in terms of recall, precision,
trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Compared to other
methods, such as deblatting, the inference is of several orders of magnitude
faster and allows applications such as real-time fast moving object detection
and retrieval in large video collections.</span>

                                        <span>Graph matching (GM) has been a building block in many areas including
computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite the recent impressive
progress, existing deep GM methods often have difficulty in handling outliers
in both graphs, which are ubiquitous in practice. We propose a deep
reinforcement learning (RL) based approach RGM for weighted graph matching,
whose sequential node matching scheme naturally fits with the strategy for
selective inlier matching against outliers, and supports seed graph matching. A
revocable action scheme is devised to improve the agent&#x27;s flexibility against
the complex constrained matching task. Moreover, we propose a quadratic
approximation technique to regularize the affinity matrix, in the presence of
outliers. As such, the RL agent can finish inlier matching timely when the
objective score stop growing, for which otherwise an additional hyperparameter
i.e. the number of common inliers is needed to avoid matching outliers. In this
paper, we are focused on learning the back-end solver for the most general form
of GM: the Lawler&#x27;s QAP, whose input is the affinity matrix. Our approach can
also boost other solvers using the affinity input. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real-world datasets showcase its superior performance regarding
both matching accuracy and robustness.</span>

                                        <span>Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors which measure per pixel
brightness changes. They offer numerous benefits over traditional, frame-based
cameras, including low latency, high dynamic range, high temporal resolution
and low power consumption. Thus, these sensors are suited for robotics and
virtual reality applications. To foster the development of 3D perception and
navigation algorithms with event cameras, we present the TUM-VIE dataset. It
consists of a large variety of handheld and head-mounted sequences in indoor
and outdoor environments, including rapid motion during sports and high dynamic
range scenarios. The dataset contains stereo event data, stereo grayscale
frames at 20Hz as well as IMU data at 200Hz. Timestamps between all sensors are
synchronized in hardware. The event cameras contain a large sensor of 1280x720
pixels, which is significantly larger than the sensors used in existing stereo
event datasets (at least by a factor of ten). We provide ground truth poses
from a motion capture system at 120Hz during the beginning and end of each
sequence, which can be used for trajectory evaluation. TUM-VIE includes
challenging sequences where state-of-the art visual SLAM algorithms either fail

future research on event-based visual-inertial perception algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Segmenting medical images accurately and reliably is important for disease
diagnosis and treatment. It is a challenging task because of the wide variety
of objects&#x27; sizes, shapes, and scanning modalities. Recently, many
convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been designed for segmentation tasks
and achieved great success. Few studies, however, have fully considered the
sizes of objects and thus most demonstrate poor performance on segmentation of
small objects segmentation. This can have significant impact on early detection
of disease. This paper proposes a Context Axial Reserve Attention Network
(CaraNet) to improve the segmentation performance on small objects compared
with recent state-of-the-art models. We test our CaraNet on brain tumor (BraTS

ETIS-LaribPolypDB) segmentation. Our CaraNet not only achieves the top-rank

(BN-NAS), to accelerate neural architecture search (NAS). BN-NAS can
significantly reduce the time required by model training and evaluation in NAS.
Specifically, for fast evaluation, we propose a BN-based indicator for
predicting subnet performance at a very early training stage. The BN-based
indicator further facilitates us to improve the training efficiency by only
training the BN parameters during the supernet training. This is based on our
observation that training the whole supernet is not necessary while training
only BN parameters accelerates network convergence for network architecture
search. Extensive experiments show that our method can significantly shorten
the time of training supernet by more than 10 times and shorten the time of
evaluating subnets by more than 600,000 times without losing accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>The paper proposes a Dynamic ResBlock Generative Adversarial Network
(DRB-GAN) for artistic style transfer. The style code is modeled as the shared
parameters for Dynamic ResBlocks connecting both the style encoding network and
the style transfer network. In the style encoding network, a style class-aware
attention mechanism is used to attend the style feature representation for
generating the style codes. In the style transfer network, multiple Dynamic
ResBlocks are designed to integrate the style code and the extracted CNN
semantic feature and then feed into the spatial window Layer-Instance
Normalization (SW-LIN) decoder, which enables high-quality synthetic images
with artistic style transfer. Moreover, the style collection conditional
discriminator is designed to equip our DRB-GAN model with abilities for both
arbitrary style transfer and collection style transfer during the training
stage. No matter for arbitrary style transfer or collection style transfer,
extensive experiments strongly demonstrate that our proposed DRB-GAN
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits its superior performance in
terms of visual quality and efficiency. Our source code is available at

                                        <span>We propose contextual convolution (CoConv) for visual recognition. CoConv is
a direct replacement of the standard convolution, which is the core component
of convolutional neural networks. CoConv is implicitly equipped with the
capability of incorporating contextual information while maintaining a similar
number of parameters and computational cost compared to the standard
convolution. CoConv is inspired by neuroscience studies indicating that (i)
neurons, even from the primary visual cortex (V1 area), are involved in
detection of contextual cues and that (ii) the activity of a visual neuron can
be influenced by the stimuli placed entirely outside of its theoretical
receptive field. On the one hand, we integrate CoConv in the widely-used
residual networks and show improved recognition performance over baselines on
the core tasks and benchmarks for visual recognition, namely image
classification on the ImageNet data set and object detection on the MS COCO
data set. On the other hand, we introduce CoConv in the generator of a
state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network, showing improved generative
results on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Collecting large annotated datasets in Remote Sensing is often expensive and
thus can become a major obstacle for training advanced machine learning models.
Common techniques of addressing this issue, based on the underlying idea of
pre-training the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on freely available large datasets,
cannot be used for Remote Sensing due to the unavailability of such large-scale
labeled datasets and the heterogeneity of data sources caused by the varying
spatial and spectral resolution of different sensors. Self-supervised learning
is an alternative approach that learns feature representation from unlabeled
images without using any human annotations. In this paper, we introduce a new
method for land cover mapping by using a clustering based pretext task for
self-supervised learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two
societally relevant applications from the aspect of segmentation performance,
discriminative feature representation learning and the underlying cluster
structure. We also show the effectiveness of the active sampling using the
clusters obtained from our method in improving the mapping accuracy given a
limited budget of annotating.</span>

been invented for visual analysis. However, there is great potential for
development of these networks since the given information of point cloud data
has not been fully exploited. To improve the effectiveness of existing networks
in analyzing point cloud data, we propose a plug-and-play module, PnP-3D,
aiming to refine the fundamental point cloud feature representations by
involving more local context and global bilinear response from explicit 3D
space and implicit feature space. To thoroughly evaluate our approach, we
conduct experiments on three standard point cloud analysis tasks, including
classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, where we select
three state-of-the-art networks from each task for evaluation. Serving as a
plug-and-play module, PnP-3D can significantly boost the performances of
established networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art results on four
widely used point cloud benchmarks, we present comprehensive ablation studies
and visualizations to demonstrate our approach&#x27;s advantages. The code will be

when a network is used in novel operating domains that differ from its training
and testing domains. This is a major limitation, as networks are being
integrated into safety critical, cyber-physical systems that must work in
unconstrained environments, e.g., perception for autonomous vehicles. Training
networks that generalize to novel operating domains and that extract robust
features is an active area of research, but previous work fails to predict what
the network performance will be in novel operating domains. We propose the task
Network Generalization Prediction: predicting the expected network performance
in novel operating domains. We describe the network performance in terms of an
interpretable Context Subspace, and we propose a methodology for selecting the
features of the Context Subspace that provide the most information about the
network performance. We identify the Context Subspace for a pretrained Faster
RCNN network performing pedestrian detection on the Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD)
Dataset, and demonstrate Network Generalization Prediction accuracy within 5%
or less of observed performance. We also demonstrate that the Context Subspace
from the BDD Dataset is informative for completely unseen datasets, JAAD and
Cityscapes, where predictions have a bias of 10% or less.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we tackle the problem of dense light field (LF) reconstruction
from sparsely-sampled ones with wide baselines and propose a learnable model,
namely dynamic interpolation, to replace the commonly-used geometry warping
operation. Specifically, with the estimated geometric relation between input
views, we first construct a lightweight neural network to dynamically learn
weights for interpolating neighbouring pixels from input views to synthesize
each pixel of novel views independently. In contrast to the fixed and
content-independent weights employed in the geometry warping operation, the
learned interpolation weights implicitly incorporate the correspondences
between the source and novel views and adapt to different image content
information. Then, we recover the spatial correlation between the independently
synthesized pixels of each novel view by referring to that of input views using
a geometry-based spatial refinement module. We also constrain the angular
correlation between the novel views through a disparity-oriented LF structure
loss. Experimental results on LF datasets with wide baselines show that the
reconstructed LFs achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM and preserve the LF parallax
structure better than state-of-the-art methods. The source code is publicly

                                        <span>Neural text matching models have been widely used in community question
answering, information retrieval, and dialogue. However, these models designed
for short texts cannot well address the long-form text matching problem,
because there are many contexts in long-form texts can not be directly aligned
with each other, and it is difficult for existing models to capture the key
matching signals from such noisy data. Besides, these models are
computationally expensive for simply use all textual data indiscriminately. To
tackle the effectiveness and efficiency problem, we propose a novel
hierarchical noise filtering model, namely Match-Ignition. The main idea is to
plug the well-known PageRank algorithm into the Transformer, to identify and
filter both sentence and word level noisy information in the matching process.
Noisy sentences are usually easy to detect because previous work has shown that
their similarity can be explicitly evaluated by the word overlapping, so we
directly use PageRank to filter such information based on a sentence similarity
graph. Unlike sentences, words rely on their contexts to express concrete
meanings, so we propose to jointly learn the filtering and matching process, to
well capture the critical word-level matching signals. Specifically, a word
graph is first built based on the attention scores in each self-attention block
of Transformer, and key words are then selected by applying PageRank on this
graph. In this way, noisy words will be filtered out layer by layer in the
matching process. Experimental results show that Match-Ignition outperforms
both SOTA short text matching models and recent long-form text matching models.
We also conduct detailed analysis to show that Match-Ignition efficiently
captures important sentences and words, to facilitate the long-form text
matching process.</span>

of whether a user will click on an item, is an essential task for many online
applications. Due to the nature of data sparsity and high dimensionality of CTR
prediction, a key to making effective prediction is to model high-order feature
interaction. An efficient way to do this is to perform inner product of feature
embeddings with self-attentive neural networks. To better model complex feature
interaction, in this paper we propose a novel DisentanglEd Self-atTentIve
NEtwork (DESTINE) framework for CTR prediction that explicitly decouples the
computation of unary feature importance from pairwise interaction.
Specifically, the unary term models the general importance of one feature on
all other features, whereas the pairwise interaction term contributes to
learning the pure impact for each feature pair. We conduct extensive
experiments using two real-world benchmark datasets. The results show that
DESTINE not only maintains computational efficiency but achieves consistent
improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Syntactic annotation of corpora in the form of part-of-speech (POS) tags is a
key requirement for both linguistic research and subsequent automated natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. This problem is commonly tackled using machine
learning methods, i.e., by training a POS tagger on a sufficiently large corpus
of labeled data. While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered
as solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more
difficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of
training data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today,
nor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS
tagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of
forcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be
enabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging
within the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to
express its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of
guessing a single one. The goal is to guarantee a high confidence that the
correct POS tag is included while keeping the number of candidates small. In
our experimental study, we find that extending state-of-the-art POS taggers to
set-valued prediction yields more precise and robust taggings, especially for
unknown words, i.e., words not occurring in the training data.</span>

                                        <span>Successful sequential recommendation systems rely on accurately capturing the
user&#x27;s short-term and long-term interest. Although Transformer-based models
achieved state-of-the-art performance in the sequential recommendation task,
they generally require quadratic memory and time complexity to the sequence
length, making it difficult to extract the long-term interest of users. On the
other hand, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)-based models, renowned for their
linear memory and time complexity, have recently shown competitive results
compared to Transformer in various tasks. Given the availability of a massive
amount of the user&#x27;s behavior history, the linear memory and time complexity of
MLP-based models make them a promising alternative to explore in the sequential
recommendation task. To this end, we adopted MLP-based models in sequential
recommendation but consistently observed that MLP-based methods obtain lower
performance than those of Transformer despite their computational benefits.
From experiments, we observed that introducing explicit high-order interactions
to MLP layers mitigates such performance gap. In response, we propose the
Multi-Order Interaction (MOI) layer, which is capable of expressing an
arbitrary order of interactions within the inputs while maintaining the memory
and time complexity of the MLP layer. By replacing the MLP layer with the MOI
layer, our model was able to achieve comparable performance with
Transformer-based models while retaining the MLP-based models&#x27; computational
benefits.</span>

algorithms for collaborative filtering (CF). Nevertheless, the theoretical
underpinnings of their empirical successes remain elusive. In this paper, we
endeavor to obtain a better understanding of GCN-based CF methods via the lens
of graph signal processing. By identifying the critical role of smoothness, a
key concept in graph signal processing, we develop a unified graph
convolution-based framework for CF. We prove that many existing CF methods are
special cases of this framework, including the neighborhood-based methods,
low-rank matrix factorization, linear auto-encoders, and LightGCN,
corresponding to different low-pass filters. Based on our framework, we then
present a simple and computationally efficient CF baseline, which we shall
refer to as Graph Filter based Collaborative Filtering (GF-CF). Given an
implicit feedback matrix, GF-CF can be obtained in a closed form instead of
expensive training with back-propagation. Experiments will show that GF-CF
achieves competitive or better performance against deep learning-based methods
on three well-known datasets, notably with a $70\%$ performance gain over
LightGCN on the Amazon-book dataset.</span>

performance. Prior studies mainly resorted to the semantic matching between
textual queries and user/product related documents, leaving the user
collaborative behaviors untapped. In fact, the collaborative filtering signals
between users intuitively offer a complementary information for the semantic
matching. To close the gap between collaborative filtering and product search,
we propose a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HHGNN) approach
in this paper. Specifically, we organize HHGNN with a hierarchical graph
structure according to the three edge types. The sequence edge accounts for the
syntax formulation from word nodes to sentence nodes; the composition edge
aggregates the semantic features to the user and product nodes; and the
interaction edge on the top performs graph convolutional operation between user
and product nodes. At last, we integrate the higher-order neighboring
collaborative features and the semantic features for better representation
learning. We conduct extensive experiments on six Amazon review datasets. The
results show that our proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art
baselines with a large margin. In addition, we empirically prove that
collaborative filtering and semantic matching are complementary to each other
in product search performance enhancement.</span>

We introduce the notion of divergence to measure this performance difference

                                        <span>An independent ethical assessment of an artificial intelligence system is an
impartial examination of the system&#x27;s development, deployment, and use in
alignment with ethical values. System-level qualitative frameworks that
describe high-level requirements and component-level quantitative metrics that
measure individual ethical dimensions have been developed over the past few
years. However, there exists a gap between the two, which hinders the execution
of independent ethical assessments in practice. This study bridges this gap and
designs a holistic independent ethical assessment process for a text
classification model with a special focus on the task of hate speech detection.
The assessment is further augmented with protected attributes mining and
counterfactual-based analysis to enhance bias assessment. It covers assessments
of technical performance, data bias, embedding bias, classification bias, and
interpretability. The proposed process is demonstrated through an assessment of
a deep hate speech detection model.</span>

stationary and the model has to learn without forgetting existing knowledge.
The study of CL for sequential patterns revolves around trained recurrent
networks. In this work, instead, we introduce CL in the context of Echo State
Networks (ESNs), where the recurrent component is kept fixed. We provide the
first evaluation of catastrophic forgetting in ESNs and we highlight the
benefits in using CL strategies which are not applicable to trained recurrent
models. Our results confirm the ESN as a promising model for CL and open to its
use in streaming scenarios.</span>

introduce a new dataset, Who&#x27;s Waldo, mined automatically from image-caption

the algorithms currently used are black-boxes that cannot be either easily

which acquires impressive performance with numerous training resources.
However, one of the greatest challenges in RL is generalization efficiency
(i.e., generalization performance in a unit time). This paper proposes a
framework of Active Reinforcement Learning (ARL) over MDPs to improve
generalization efficiency in a limited resource by instance selection. Given a
number of instances, the algorithm chooses out valuable instances as training
sets while training the policy, thereby costing fewer resources. Unlike
existing approaches, we attempt to actively select and use training data rather
than train on all the given data, thereby costing fewer resources. Furthermore,
we introduce a general instance evaluation metrics and selection mechanism into
the framework. Experiments results reveal that the proposed framework with
Proximal Policy Optimization as policy optimizer can effectively improve
generalization efficiency than unselect-ed and unbiased selected methods.</span>

within rich, photorealistic environments. However, such techniques often rely
on traditional discrete-time neural models and face difficulties in
generalizing to domain shifts by failing to account for the causal
relationships between the agent and the environment. In this paper, we propose
a theoretical and experimental framework for learning causal representations
using continuous-time neural networks, specifically over their discrete-time
counterparts. We evaluate our method in the context of visual-control learning
of drones over a series of complex tasks, ranging from short- and long-term
navigation, to chasing static and dynamic objects through photorealistic
environments. Our results demonstrate that causal continuous-time deep models
can perform robust navigation tasks, where advanced recurrent models fail.
These models learn complex causal control representations directly from raw
visual inputs and scale to solve a variety of tasks using imitation learning.</span>

spatial and semantic cues to efficiently achieve their navigation goals.
Towards equipping computational agents with similar capabilities, we introduce
Pathdreamer, a visual world model for agents navigating in novel indoor
environments. Given one or more previous visual observations, Pathdreamer
generates plausible high-resolution 360 visual observations (RGB, semantic
segmentation and depth) for viewpoints that have not been visited, in buildings
not seen during training. In regions of high uncertainty (e.g. predicting
around corners, imagining the contents of an unseen room), Pathdreamer can
predict diverse scenes, allowing an agent to sample multiple realistic outcomes
for a given trajectory. We demonstrate that Pathdreamer encodes useful and
accessible visual, spatial and semantic knowledge about human environments by
using it in the downstream task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN).
Specifically, we show that planning ahead with Pathdreamer brings about half
the benefit of looking ahead at actual observations from unobserved parts of
the environment. We hope that Pathdreamer will help unlock model-based

                                        <span>This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that
capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in
adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the
two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the
high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these
differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is
computed with \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme
brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to
non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.
This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales
and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These
qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision
tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and
dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP
on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its
performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7
box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the
potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical
design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP
architectures. The code and models are publicly available

                                        <span>With the fast development of quantum computing and deep learning, quantum
neural networks have attracted great attention recently. By leveraging the
power of quantum computing, deep neural networks can potentially overcome
computational power limitations in classic machine learning. However, when
multiple quantum machines wish to train a global model using the local data on
each machine, it may be very difficult to copy the data into one machine and
train the model. Therefore, a collaborative quantum neural network framework is
necessary. In this article, we borrow the core idea of federated learning to
propose QuantumFed, a quantum federated learning framework to have multiple
quantum nodes with local quantum data train a mode together. Our experiments
show the feasibility and robustness of our framework.</span>

                                        <span>Standard methods in preference learning involve estimating the parameters of
discrete choice models from data of selections (choices) made by individuals
from a discrete set of alternatives (the choice set). While there are many
models for individual preferences, existing learning methods overlook how
choice set assignment affects the data. Often, the choice set itself is
influenced by an individual&#x27;s preferences; for instance, a consumer choosing a
product from an online retailer is often presented with options from a
recommender system that depend on information about the consumer&#x27;s preferences.
Ignoring these assignment mechanisms can mislead choice models into making
biased estimates of preferences, a phenomenon that we call choice set
confounding; we demonstrate the presence of such confounding in widely-used
choice datasets.

To address this issue, we adapt methods from causal inference to the discrete
choice setting. We use covariates of the chooser for inverse probability
weighting and/or regression controls, accurately recovering individual
preferences in the presence of choice set confounding under certain
assumptions. When such covariates are unavailable or inadequate, we develop
methods that take advantage of structured choice set assignment to improve
prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real-world
choice data, showing, for example, that accounting for choice set confounding
makes choices observed in hotel booking and commute transportation more
consistent with rational utility-maximization.</span>

their excellent real-time performance as raw data from most of the mainstream
3D sensors. Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular
research direction in recent years. So far, however, there has been little
discussion about the explainability of deep neural networks for point clouds.
In this paper, we propose a point cloud-applicable explainability approach
based on local surrogate model-based method to show which components contribute
to the classification. Moreover, we propose quantitative fidelity validations
for generated explanations that enhance the persuasive power of explainability
and compare the plausibility of different existing point cloud-applicable
explainability methods. Our new explainability approach provides a fairly
accurate, more semantically coherent and widely applicable explanation for
point cloud classification tasks. Our code is available at

does not guarantee convergence. In this work, we show that DQN can diverge and
cease to operate in realistic settings. Although there exist gradient-based
convergent methods, we show that they actually have inherent problems in
learning behaviour and elucidate why they often fail in practice. To overcome
these problems, we propose a convergent DQN algorithm (C-DQN) by carefully
modifying DQN, and we show that the algorithm is convergent and can work with
large discount factors (0.9998). It learns robustly in difficult settings and
can learn several difficult games in the Atari 2600 benchmark where DQN fail,
within a moderate computational budget. Our codes have been publicly released
and can be used to reproduce our results.</span>

privacy (DP), capable of deployment to data-driven tasks such as machine
learning (ML), have emerged. Reconciling large-scale ML with the closed-form
reasoning required for the principled analysis of individual privacy loss
requires the introduction of new tools for automatic sensitivity analysis and
for tracking an individual&#x27;s data and their features through the flow of
computation. For this purpose, we introduce a novel \textit{hybrid} automatic
differentiation (AD) system which combines the efficiency of reverse-mode AD
with an ability to obtain a closed-form expression for any given quantity in
the computational graph. This enables modelling the sensitivity of arbitrary
differentiable function compositions, such as the training of neural networks
on private data. We demonstrate our approach by analysing the individual DP
guarantees of statistical database queries. Moreover, we investigate the
application of our technique to the training of DP neural networks. Our
approach can enable the principled reasoning about privacy loss in the setting
of data processing, and further the development of automatic sensitivity

the instantaneous rate of change in the state of a system. However, despite
their apparent suitability for dynamics-governed time-series, NODEs present a
few disadvantages. First, they are unable to adapt to incoming data points, a
fundamental requirement for real-time applications imposed by the natural
direction of time. Second, time series are often composed of a sparse set of
measurements that could be explained by many possible underlying dynamics.
NODEs do not capture this uncertainty. In contrast, Neural Processes (NPs) are
a family of models providing uncertainty estimation and fast data adaptation
but lack an explicit treatment of the flow of time. To address these problems,
we introduce Neural ODE Processes (NDPs), a new class of stochastic processes
determined by a distribution over Neural ODEs. By maintaining an adaptive
data-dependent distribution over the underlying ODE, we show that our model can
successfully capture the dynamics of low-dimensional systems from just a few
data points. At the same time, we demonstrate that NDPs scale up to challenging
high-dimensional time-series with unknown latent dynamics such as rotating
MNIST digits.</span>

parameters. These parameters act as &quot;memory&quot; for the trained models and help
them generalize well on unseen data. However, in absence of training data, the
utility of a trained model is merely limited to either inference or better
initialization towards a target task. In this paper, we go further and extract
synthetic data by leveraging the learnt model parameters. We dub them &quot;Data
Impressions&quot;, which act as proxy to the training data and can be used to
realize a variety of tasks. These are useful in scenarios where only the
pretrained models are available and the training data is not shared (e.g., due
to privacy or sensitivity concerns). We show the applicability of data
impressions in solving several computer vision tasks such as unsupervised
domain adaptation, continual learning as well as knowledge distillation. We
also study the adversarial robustness of lightweight models trained via
knowledge distillation using these data impressions. Further, we demonstrate

                                        <span>Causal graphs (CGs) are compact representations of the knowledge of the data
generating processes behind the data distributions. When a CG is available,
e.g., from the domain knowledge, we can infer the conditional independence (CI)
relations that should hold in the data distribution. However, it is not
straightforward how to incorporate this knowledge into predictive modeling. In
this work, we propose a model-agnostic data augmentation method that allows us
to exploit the prior knowledge of the CI encoded in a CG for supervised machine
learning. We theoretically justify the proposed method by providing an excess
risk bound indicating that the proposed method suppresses overfitting by
reducing the apparent complexity of the predictor hypothesis class. Using
real-world data with CGs provided by domain experts, we experimentally show
that the proposed method is effective in improving the prediction accuracy,
especially in the small-data regime.</span>

                                        <span>Cluster interpretation after dimensionality reduction (DR) is a ubiquitous
part of exploring multidimensional datasets. DR results are frequently
represented by scatterplots, where spatial proximity encodes similarity among
data samples. In the literature, techniques support the understanding of
scatterplots&#x27; organization by visualizing the importance of the features for
cluster definition with layout enrichment strategies. However, current
approaches usually focus on global information, hampering the analysis whenever
the focus is to understand the differences among clusters. Thus, this paper
introduces a methodology to visually explore DR results and interpret clusters&#x27;
formation based on contrastive analysis. We also introduce a bipartite graph to
visually interpret and explore the relationship between the statistical
variables employed to understand how the data features influence cluster
formation. Our approach is demonstrated through case studies, in which we
explore two document collections related to news articles and tweets about
COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, we evaluate our approach through quantitative
results to demonstrate its robustness to support multidimensional analysis.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic augmentation methods have recently become a crucial pillar for
strong model performance in vision tasks. While existing automatic augmentation
methods need to trade off simplicity, cost and performance, we present a most
simple baseline, TrivialAugment, that outperforms previous methods for almost
free. TrivialAugment is parameter-free and only applies a single augmentation
to each image. Thus, TrivialAugment&#x27;s effectiveness is very unexpected to us
and we performed very thorough experiments to study its performance. First, we
compare TrivialAugment to previous state-of-the-art methods in a variety of
image classification scenarios. Then, we perform multiple ablation studies with
different augmentation spaces, augmentation methods and setups to understand
the crucial requirements for its performance. Additionally, we provide a simple
interface to facilitate the widespread adoption of automatic augmentation
methods, as well as our full code base for reproducibility. Since our work
reveals a stagnation in many parts of automatic augmentation research, we end
with a short proposal of best practices for sustained future progress in
automatic augmentation methods.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in differentiable rendering have sparked an interest in
learning generative models of textured 3D meshes from image collections. These
models natively disentangle pose and appearance, enable downstream applications
in computer graphics, and improve the ability of generative models to
understand the concept of image formation. Although there has been prior work
on learning such models from collections of 2D images, these approaches require
a delicate pose estimation step that exploits annotated keypoints, thereby
restricting their applicability to a few specific datasets. In this work, we
propose a GAN framework for generating textured triangle meshes without relying
on such annotations. We show that the performance of our approach is on par
with prior work that relies on ground-truth keypoints, and more importantly, we
demonstrate the generality of our method by setting new baselines on a larger
set of categories from ImageNet - for which keypoints are not available -
without any class-specific hyperparameter tuning. We release our code at

yielding learning guarantees that improve with the quality of the injected
knowledge in both cases. As particular cases of our framework, we present
models which can incorporate user and item biases or community information in a

reasoning and intelligence in humans. However for artificial learning systems,
abstract reasoning remains a challenging problem. In this paper we investigate
how neural networks augmented with biologically inspired spiking modules gain a
significant advantage in solving this problem. To illustrate this, we first
investigate the performance of our networks with supervised learning, then with
unsupervised learning. Experiments on the RAVEN dataset show that the overall
accuracy of our supervised networks surpass human-level performance, while our
unsupervised networks significantly outperform existing unsupervised methods.
Finally, our results from both supervised and unsupervised learning illustrate
that, unlike their non-augmented counterparts, networks with spiking modules
are able to extract and encode temporal features without any explicit
instruction, do not heavily rely on training data, and generalise more readily
to new problems. In summary, the results reported here indicate that artificial
neural networks with spiking modules are well suited to solving abstract
reasoning.</span>

                                        <span>Imitation Learning (IL) is an effective framework to learn visuomotor skills
from offline demonstration data. However, IL methods often fail to generalize
to new scene configurations not covered by training data. On the other hand,
humans can manipulate objects in varying conditions. Key to such capability is
hand-eye coordination, a cognitive ability that enables humans to adaptively
direct their movements at task-relevant objects and be invariant to the
objects&#x27; absolute spatial location. In this work, we present a learnable action
space, Hand-eye Action Networks (HAN), that can approximate human&#x27;s hand-eye
coordination behaviors by learning from human teleoperated demonstrations.
Through a set of challenging multi-stage manipulation tasks, we show that a
visuomotor policy equipped with HAN is able to inherit the key spatial
invariance property of hand-eye coordination and achieve zero-shot
generalization to new scene configurations. Additional materials available at

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted enormous research interest due
to temporal information processing capability, low power consumption, and high
biological plausibility. However, the formulation of efficient and
high-performance learning algorithms for SNNs is still challenging. Most
existing learning methods learn weights only, and require manual tuning of the
membrane-related parameters that determine the dynamics of a single spiking
neuron. These parameters are typically chosen to be the same for all neurons,
which limits the diversity of neurons and thus the expressiveness of the
resulting SNNs. In this paper, we take inspiration from the observation that
membrane-related parameters are different across brain regions, and propose a
training algorithm that is capable of learning not only the synaptic weights
but also the membrane time constants of SNNs. We show that incorporating
learnable membrane time constants can make the network less sensitive to
initial values and can speed up learning. In addition, we reevaluate the
pooling methods in SNNs and find that max-pooling will not lead to significant
information loss and have the advantage of low computation cost and binary
compatibility. We evaluate the proposed method for image classification tasks
on both traditional static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets, and
neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128 Gesture datasets. The experiment
results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy
on nearly all datasets, using fewer time-steps. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>The label shift problem refers to the supervised learning setting where the
train and test label distributions do not match. Existing work addressing label
shift usually assumes access to an \emph{unlabelled} test sample. This sample
may be used to estimate the test label distribution, and to then train a
suitably re-weighted classifier. While approaches using this idea have proven
effective, their scope is limited as it is not always feasible to access the
target domain; further, they require repeated retraining if the model is to be
deployed in \emph{multiple} test environments. Can one instead learn a
\emph{single} classifier that is robust to arbitrary label shifts from a broad
family? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a model that
minimises an objective based on distributionally robust optimisation (DRO). We
then design and analyse a gradient descent-proximal mirror ascent algorithm
tailored for large-scale problems to optimise the proposed objective. %, and
establish its convergence. Finally, through experiments on CIFAR-100 and
ImageNet, we show that our technique can significantly improve performance over
a number of baselines in settings where label shift is present.</span>

learning (ML) models such as partial dependence plots (PDP), permutation
feature importance (PFI) and Shapley values provide insightful model
interpretations, but can lead to wrong conclusions if applied incorrectly. We
highlight many general pitfalls of ML model interpretation, such as using
interpretation techniques in the wrong context, interpreting models that do not
generalize well, ignoring feature dependencies, interactions, uncertainty
estimates and issues in high-dimensional settings, or making unjustified causal
interpretations, and illustrate them with examples. We focus on pitfalls for
global methods that describe the average model behavior, but many pitfalls also
apply to local methods that explain individual predictions. Our paper addresses
ML practitioners by raising awareness of pitfalls and identifying solutions for
correct model interpretation, but also addresses ML researchers by discussing
open issues for further research.</span>

                                        <span>Graph matching (GM) has been a building block in many areas including
computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite the recent impressive
progress, existing deep GM methods often have difficulty in handling outliers
in both graphs, which are ubiquitous in practice. We propose a deep
reinforcement learning (RL) based approach RGM for weighted graph matching,
whose sequential node matching scheme naturally fits with the strategy for
selective inlier matching against outliers, and supports seed graph matching. A
revocable action scheme is devised to improve the agent&#x27;s flexibility against
the complex constrained matching task. Moreover, we propose a quadratic
approximation technique to regularize the affinity matrix, in the presence of
outliers. As such, the RL agent can finish inlier matching timely when the
objective score stop growing, for which otherwise an additional hyperparameter
i.e. the number of common inliers is needed to avoid matching outliers. In this
paper, we are focused on learning the back-end solver for the most general form
of GM: the Lawler&#x27;s QAP, whose input is the affinity matrix. Our approach can
also boost other solvers using the affinity input. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real-world datasets showcase its superior performance regarding
both matching accuracy and robustness.</span>

offers the promise of freeing algorithm designers and programmers from
specifying how those choices should be made; in implementations, the choices
can be realized by optimization techniques and, increasingly, by
machine-learning methods. We study this approach from a programming-language
perspective. We define two small languages that support decision-making
abstractions: one with choices and rewards, and the other additionally with
probabilities. We give both operational and denotational semantics.

In the case of the second language we consider three denotational semantics,
with varying degrees of correlation between possible program values and
expected rewards. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of
standard constructs with optimization over spaces of possible execution
strategies. The denotational semantics, which are compositional, rely on the
selection monad, to handle choice, augmented with an auxiliary monad to handle
other effects, such as rewards or probability.

We establish adequacy theorems that the two semantics coincide in all cases.
We also prove full abstraction at base types, with varying notions of
observation in the probabilistic case corresponding to the various degrees of
correlation. We present axioms for choice combined with rewards and
probability, establishing completeness at base types for the case of rewards
without probability.</span>

graphical neural networks. Unlike conventional methods, where nodes send scaled
but otherwise identical messages to each of their neighbours, we propose to
condition messages between pairs of nodes on their spatial relationships,
resulting in different messages going to neighbours of the same node. To this
end, we explore various ways of applying spatial conditioning under a
multi-branch structure. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate the
advantages of spatial conditioning for the computation of the adjacency
structure, messages and the refined graph features. In particular, we
empirically show that as the quality of the bounding boxes increases, their
coarse appearance features contribute relatively less to the disambiguation of
interactions compared to the spatial information. Our method achieves an mAP of
31.33% on HICO-DET and 54.2% on V-COCO, significantly outperforming

                                        <span>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has recently gained increased attention, as
a class of approaches that automatically searches in an input space of network
architectures. A crucial part of the NAS pipeline is the encoding of the
architecture that consists of the applied computational blocks, namely the
operations and the links between them. Most of the existing approaches either
fail to capture the structural properties of the architectures or use
hand-engineered vector to encode the operator information. In this paper, we
propose the replacement of fixed operator encoding with learnable
representations in the optimization process. This approach, which effectively
captures the relations of different operations, leads to smoother and more
accurate representations of the architectures and consequently to improved
performance of the end task. Our extensive evaluation in ENAS benchmark

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of speaker verification in conditions
unseen or unknown during development. A standard method for speaker
verification consists of extracting speaker embeddings with a deep neural
network and processing them through a backend composed of probabilistic linear
discriminant analysis (PLDA) and global logistic regression score calibration.
This method is known to result in systems that work poorly on conditions
different from those used to train the calibration model. We propose to modify
the standard backend, introducing an adaptive calibrator that uses duration and
other automatically extracted side-information to adapt to the conditions of
the inputs. The backend is trained discriminatively to optimize binary
cross-entropy. When trained on a number of diverse datasets that are labeled
only with respect to speaker, the proposed backend consistently and, in some
cases, dramatically improves calibration, compared to the standard PLDA
approach, on a number of held-out datasets, some of which are markedly
different from the training data. Discrimination performance is also
consistently improved. We show that joint training of the PLDA and the adaptive
calibrator is essential -- the same benefits cannot be achieved when freezing
PLDA and fine-tuning the calibrator. To our knowledge, the results in this
paper are the first evidence in the literature that it is possible to develop a
speaker verification system with robust out-of-the-box performance on a large
variety of conditions.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-view projection methods have demonstrated their ability to reach
state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape recognition. Those methods learn
different ways to aggregate information from multiple views. However, the
camera view-points for those views tend to be heuristically set and fixed for
all shapes. To circumvent the lack of dynamism of current multi-view methods,
we propose to learn those view-points. In particular, we introduce the
Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN) that regresses optimal view-points for
3D shape recognition, building upon advances in differentiable rendering. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end along with any multi-view network for 3D
shape classification. We integrate MVTN in a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that can render either 3D meshes or point clouds. MVTN exhibits clear
performance gains in the tasks of 3D shape classification and 3D shape
retrieval without the need for extra training supervision. In these tasks, MVTN
achieves state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet40, ShapeNet Core55, and the
most recent and realistic ScanObjectNN dataset (up to 6% improvement).
Interestingly, we also show that MVTN can provide network robustness against
rotation and occlusion in the 3D domain. The code is available at

                                        <span>Syntactic annotation of corpora in the form of part-of-speech (POS) tags is a
key requirement for both linguistic research and subsequent automated natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. This problem is commonly tackled using machine
learning methods, i.e., by training a POS tagger on a sufficiently large corpus
of labeled data. While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered
as solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more
difficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of
training data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today,
nor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS
tagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of
forcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be
enabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging
within the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to
express its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of
guessing a single one. The goal is to guarantee a high confidence that the
correct POS tag is included while keeping the number of candidates small. In
our experimental study, we find that extending state-of-the-art POS taggers to
set-valued prediction yields more precise and robust taggings, especially for
unknown words, i.e., words not occurring in the training data.</span>

                                        <span>The growing number of Internet users and the prevalence of web applications
make it necessary to deal with very complex software and applications in the
network. This results in an increasing number of new vulnerabilities in the
systems, and leading to an increase in cyber threats and, in particular,
zero-day attacks. The cost of generating appropriate signatures for these
attacks is a potential motive for using machine learning-based methodologies.
Although there are many studies on using learning-based methods for attack
detection, they generally use extracted features and overlook raw contents.
This approach can lessen the performance of detection systems against
content-based attacks like SQL injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and
various viruses.

In this work, we propose a framework, called deep intrusion detection (DID)
system, that uses the pure content of traffic flows in addition to traffic
metadata in the learning and detection phases of a passive DNN IDS. To this
end, we deploy and evaluate an offline IDS following the framework using LSTM
as a deep learning technique. Due to the inherent nature of deep learning, it
can process high dimensional data content and, accordingly, discover the
sophisticated relations between the auto extracted features of the traffic. To
evaluate the proposed DID system, we use the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018
datasets. The evaluation metrics, such as precision and recall, reach $0.992$
and $0.998$ on CIC-IDS2017, and $0.933$ and $0.923$ on CSE-CIC-IDS2018
respectively, which show the high performance of the proposed DID method.</span>

                                        <span>3D point cloud understanding has made great progress in recent years.
However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets,
especially compared to 2D object detection tasks, since a large amount of labor
is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to
this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of
CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved
by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D
pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic
objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new
method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we
propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in
the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying
object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same
set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a
better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task.
Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on
several base models, especially when less training data are used, which
strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method.
Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic
data, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D
detection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D. We expect our attempt to provide

                                        <span>Process mining techniques can help organizations to improve their operational
processes. Organizations can benefit from process mining techniques in finding
and amending the root causes of performance or compliance problems. Considering
the volume of the data and the number of features captured by the information
system of today&#x27;s companies, the task of discovering the set of features that
should be considered in root cause analysis can be quite involving. In this
paper, we propose a method for finding the set of (aggregated) features with a
possible effect on the problem.

The root cause analysis task is usually done by applying a machine learning
technique to the data gathered from the information system supporting the
processes. To prevent mixing up correlation and causation, which may happen
because of interpreting the findings of machine learning techniques as causal,
we propose a method for discovering the structural equation model of the
process that can be used for root cause analysis. We have implemented the
proposed method as a plugin in ProM and we have evaluated it using two real and
synthetic event logs. These experiments show the validity and effectiveness of
the proposed methods.</span>

                                        <span>Assessing action quality is challenging due to the subtle differences between
videos and large variations in scores. Most existing approaches tackle this
problem by regressing a quality score from a single video, suffering a lot from
the large inter-video score variations. In this paper, we show that the
relations among videos can provide important clues for more accurate action
quality assessment during both training and inference. Specifically, we
reformulate the problem of action quality assessment as regressing the relative
scores with reference to another video that has shared attributes (e.g.,
category and difficulty), instead of learning unreferenced scores. Following
this formulation, we propose a new Contrastive Regression (CoRe) framework to
learn the relative scores by pair-wise comparison, which highlights the
differences between videos and guides the models to learn the key hints for
assessment. In order to further exploit the relative information between two
videos, we devise a group-aware regression tree to convert the conventional
score regression into two easier sub-problems: coarse-to-fine classification
and regression in small intervals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRe, we
conduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AQA datasets including AQA-7,
MTL-AQA and JIGSAWS. Our approach outperforms previous methods by a large
margin and establishes new state-of-the-art on all three benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Bootstrap aggregation, known as bagging, is one of the most popular ensemble
methods used in machine learning (ML). An ensemble method is a ML method that
combines multiple hypotheses to form a single hypothesis used for prediction. A
bagging algorithm combines multiple classifiers modeled on different
sub-samples of the same data set to build one large classifier. Banks, and
their retail banking activities, are nowadays using the power of ML algorithms,
including decision trees and random forests, to optimize their processes.
However, banks have to comply with regulators and governance and, hence,
delivering effective ML solutions is a challenging task. It starts with the
bank&#x27;s validation and governance department, followed by the deployment of the
solution in a production environment up to the external validation of the
national financial regulator. Each proposed ML model has to be validated and
clear rules for every algorithm-based decision must be justified. In this
context, we propose XtracTree, an algorithm capable of efficiently converting
an ML bagging classifier, such as a random forest, into simple &quot;if-then&quot; rules
satisfying the requirements of model validation. We use a public loan data set
from Kaggle to illustrate the usefulness of our approach. Our experiments
demonstrate that using XtracTree, one can convert an ML model into a rule-based
algorithm, leading to easier model validation by national financial regulators
and the bank&#x27;s validation department. The proposed approach allowed our banking
institution to reduce up to 50% the time of delivery of our AI solutions to the
end-user.</span>

                                        <span>Introduction: When a learner fails to reach a milestone, educators often
wonder if there had been any warning signs that could have allowed them to
intervene sooner. Machine learning is used to predict which students are at
risk of failing a national certifying exam. Predictions are made well in
advance of the exam, such that educators can meaningfully intervene before
students take the exam.

Methods: Using already-collected, first-year student assessment data from
four cohorts in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies program, the authors
implement an &quot;adaptive minimum match&quot; version of the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm (AMMKNN), using changing numbers of neighbors to predict each
student&#x27;s future exam scores on the Physician Assistant National Certifying
Examination (PANCE). Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used to
evaluate the practical capabilities of this model, before making predictions
for new students.

Results: The best predictive model has an accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of
69%, and specificity of 94%. It generates a predicted PANCE score for each
student, one year before they are scheduled to take the exam. Students can then
be prospectively categorized into groups that need extra support, optional
extra support, or no extra support. The educator then has one year to provide
the appropriate customized support to each type of student.

Conclusions: Predictive analytics can help health professions educators
allocate scarce time and resources across their students. Interprofessional
educators can use the included methods and code to generate predicted test
outcomes for students. The authors recommend that educators using this or
similar predictive methods act responsibly and transparently.</span>

                                        <span>One of the biggest challenges that complicates applied supervised machine
learning is the need for huge amounts of labeled data. Active Learning (AL) is
a well-known standard method for efficiently obtaining labeled data by first
labeling the samples that contain the most information based on a query
strategy. Although many methods for query strategies have been proposed in the
past, no clear superior method that works well in general for all domains has
been found yet. Additionally, many strategies are computationally expensive
which further hinders the widespread use of AL for large-scale annotation
projects.

We, therefore, propose ImitAL, a novel query strategy, which encodes AL as a
learning-to-rank problem. For training the underlying neural network we chose
Imitation Learning. The required demonstrative expert experience for training
is generated from purely synthetic data.

To show the general and superior applicability of \ImitAL{}, we perform an
extensive evaluation comparing our strategy on 15 different datasets, from a
wide range of domains, with 10 different state-of-the-art query strategies. We
also show that our approach is more runtime performant than most other
strategies, especially on very large datasets.</span>

established field. Yet, newly proposed methods are evaluated and compared under
unrealistic scenarios where costs for adversary and defender are not considered
and either all samples are attacked or no sample is attacked. We scrutinize
these assumptions and propose the advanced adversarial classification game,
which incorporates all relevant parameters of an adversary and a defender in
adversarial classification. Especially, we take into account economic factors
on both sides and the fact that all so far proposed countermeasures against
adversarial examples reduce accuracy on benign samples. Analyzing the scenario
in detail, where both players have two pure strategies, we identify all best

                                        <span>With the renaissance of deep learning, automatic diagnostic systems for
computed tomography (CT) have achieved many successful applications. However,
they are mostly attributed to careful expert annotations, which are often
scarce in practice. This drives our interest to the unsupervised representation
learning. Recent studies have shown that self-supervised learning is an
effective approach for learning representations, but most of them rely on the
empirical design of transformations and pretext tasks. To avoid the
subjectivity associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel
unsupervised three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a
transformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations
to collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is
learned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D
lesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We
evaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the
embedding layer. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55%), LNDb (77.69%) and
TianChi (79.96%) datasets for unsupervised representation learning. When
fine-tuned on 10% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to the
supervised learning model (89.46% vs. 85.03%, 73.85% vs. 73.44%, 83.56% vs.
83.34% on the three datasets, respectively), indicating the superiority of
MVCNet in learning representations with limited annotations. Code is released

                                        <span>We propose a new semi-parametric model based on Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART). In our approach, the response variable is approximated by a
linear predictor and a BART model, where the first component is responsible for
estimating the main effects and BART accounts for the non-specified
interactions and non-linearities. The novelty in our approach lies in the way
we change tree generation moves in BART to deal with confounding between the
parametric and non-parametric components when they have covariates in common.
Through synthetic and real-world examples, we demonstrate that the performance
of the new semi-parametric BART is competitive when compared to regression
models and other tree-based methods. The implementation of the proposed method
is available at https://github.com/ebprado/SP-BART.</span>

open web acquire systemic biases, prejudices, and harmful views from their
training data. We present a methodology for programmatically identifying and
removing harmful text from web-scale datasets. A pretrained language model is
used to calculate the log-likelihood of researcher-written trigger phrases
conditioned on a specific document, which is used to identify and filter
documents from the dataset. We demonstrate that models trained on this filtered
dataset exhibit lower propensity to generate harmful text, with a marginal
decrease in performance on standard language modeling benchmarks compared to
unfiltered baselines. We provide a partial explanation for this performance gap
by surfacing examples of hate speech and other undesirable content from
standard language modeling benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the generalization
of this method and how trigger phrases which reflect specific values can be
used by researchers to build language models which are more closely aligned
with their values.</span>

                                        <span>Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitously found at the centers of
most massive galaxies. Measuring SMBH mass is important for understanding the
origin and evolution of SMBHs. However, traditional methods require
spectroscopic data which is expensive to gather. We present an algorithm that
weighs SMBHs using quasar light time series, circumventing the need for
expensive spectra. We train, validate, and test neural networks that directly
learn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 light curves for a
sample of $38,939$ spectroscopically confirmed quasars to map out the nonlinear
encoding between SMBH mass and multi-color optical light curves. We find a
1$\sigma$ scatter of 0.37 dex between the predicted SMBH mass and the fiducial
virial mass estimate based on SDSS single-epoch spectra, which is comparable to
the systematic uncertainty in the virial mass estimate. Our results have direct
implications for more efficient applications with future observations from the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Our code, \textsf{AGNet}, is publicly available at

an extension of traditional link prediction. This proposed end-to-end model
learns a mapping from the subgraph structures in the current snapshot to the
subgraph structures in the next snapshot directly, i.e., edge existence among
multiple nodes in the subgraph. A new mechanism named cross-attention with a
twin-tower module is designed to integrate node attribute information and
topology information collaboratively for learning subgraph evolution. We
compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods for subgraph prediction
and subgraph pattern prediction in multiple real-world homogeneous and
heterogeneous dynamic graphs, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that our model outperforms other models in these two tasks, with a gain

technology. Much statistical literature have been devoted to understanding its
performance in nonparametric estimation, whereas the results are suboptimal due
to a redundant logarithmic sacrifice. In this paper, we show that such
log-factors are not necessary. We derive upper bounds for the $L^2$ minimax
risk in nonparametric estimation. Sufficient conditions on network
architectures are provided such that the upper bounds become optimal (without
log-sacrifice). Our proof relies on an explicitly constructed network estimator
based on tensor product B-splines. We also derive asymptotic distributions for
the constructed network and a relating hypothesis testing procedure. The
testing procedure is further proven as minimax optimal under suitable network
architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Fruit flies are established model systems for studying olfactory learning as
they will readily learn to associate odors with both electric shock or sugar
rewards. The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor
learning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are
received by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of
each odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these
glomeruli then project its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000
so-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom
body (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neuropils
that decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown
that there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and
thus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to
fingerprints~-- even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging
insights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural
network that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input
layer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden
layer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization
algorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural
limits by searching a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception
tasks that predict perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet
outperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For
image-classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark
datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation
methods or convolutional layers and shows particularly fast running time. Thus,
neural networks inspired by the insect brain can be both economical and perform
well.</span>

models for program synthesis in general purpose programming languages. We
evaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on
two new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and
fine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of
these models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language
descriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974
programming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The
MathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914
problems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more
complex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales
log-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a
code dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from
MBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a
held-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage
points across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest
fine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the
model&#x27;s ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to
improve its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human
halves the error rate compared to the model&#x27;s initial prediction. Additionally,
we conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and
what types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the
semantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results
of program execution. We find that even our best models are generally unable to
predict the output of a program given a specific input.</span>

comprised of action and observation delays. The presence of delays degrades the
performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, often to such an extent
that algorithms fail to learn anything substantial. This paper formally
describes the notion of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with stochastic delays
and shows that delayed MDPs can be transformed into equivalent standard MDPs
(without delays) with significantly simplified cost structure. We employ this
equivalence to derive a model-free Delay-Resolved RL framework and show that
even a simple RL algorithm built upon this framework achieves near-optimal
rewards in environments with stochastic delays in actions and observations. The
delay-resolved deep Q-network (DRDQN) algorithm is bench-marked on a variety of
environments comprising of multi-step and stochastic delays and results in
better performance, both in terms of achieving near-optimal rewards and
minimizing the computational overhead thereof, with respect to the currently
established algorithms.</span>

infrastructure is a critical component of the future success of electric
vehicles (EVs). In Albany County in New York, the expected rise in the EV
population requires additional charging stations to maintain a sufficient level
of efficiency across the charging infrastructure. A novel application of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is able to find optimal locations for new charging
stations given the predicted charging demand and current charging locations.
The most important factors that influence charging demand prediction include
the conterminous traffic density, EV registrations, and proximity to certain
types of public buildings. The proposed RL framework can be refined and applied
to cities across the world to optimize charging station placement.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a direct domain adaptation (DDA) approach to enrich the training
of supervised neural networks on synthetic data by features from real-world
data. The process involves a series of linear operations on the input features
to the NN model, whether they are from the source or target domains, as
follows: 1) A cross-correlation of the input data (i.e. images) with a randomly
picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images from that domain or the mean of
all randomly picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images. 2) The convolution
of the resulting data with the mean of the autocorrelated input images from the
other domain. In the training stage, as expected, the input images are from the
source domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from the
target domain. In the inference/application stage, the input images are from
the target domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from
the source domain. The proposed method only manipulates the data from the
source and target domains and does not explicitly interfere with the training
workflow and network architecture. An application that includes training a
convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset and testing the network on
the MNIST-M dataset achieves a 70% accuracy on the test data. A principal
component analysis (PCA), as well as t-SNE, show that the input features from
the source and target domains, after the proposed direct transformations, share
similar properties along with the principal components as compared to the
original MNIST and MNIST-M input features.</span>

(DNNs) have excited extensive interest in domain-specific DNN accelerators,
among which optical DNN accelerators are particularly promising thanks to their
unprecedented potential of achieving superior performance-per-watt. However,
the development of optical DNN accelerators is much slower than that of
electrical DNN accelerators. One key challenge is that while many techniques
have been developed to facilitate the development of electrical DNN
accelerators, techniques that support or expedite optical DNN accelerator
design remain much less explored, limiting both the achievable performance and
the innovation development of optical DNN accelerators. To this end, we develop
the first-of-its-kind framework dubbed O-HAS, which for the first time
demonstrates automated Optical Hardware Accelerator Search for boosting both
the acceleration efficiency and development speed of optical DNN accelerators.
Specifically, our O-HAS consists of two integrated enablers: (1) an O-Cost
Predictor, which can accurately yet efficiently predict an optical
accelerator&#x27;s energy and latency based on the DNN model parameters and the
optical accelerator design; and (2) an O-Search Engine, which can automatically
explore the large design space of optical DNN accelerators and identify the
optimal accelerators (i.e., the micro-architectures and
algorithm-to-accelerator mapping methods) in order to maximize the target
acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
consistently validate the effectiveness of both our O-Cost Predictor and
O-Search Engine as well as the excellent efficiency of O-HAS generated optical
accelerators.</span>

unsupervised learning using numerous data mining techniques. Neural networks
often need a greater collection of observations to achieve enough predictive
ability. Due to the increase in the rate of poor graduates, it is necessary to
design a system that helps to reduce this menace as well as reduce the
incidence of students having to repeat due to poor performance or having to
drop out of school altogether in the middle of the pursuit of their career. It
is therefore necessary to study each one as well as their advantages and
disadvantages, so as to determine which is more efficient in and in what case
one should be preferred over the other. The study aims to develop a system to
predict student performance with Artificial Neutral Network using the student
demographic traits so as to assist the university in selecting candidates
(students) with a high prediction of success for admission using previous
academic records of students granted admissions which will eventually lead to
quality graduates of the institution. The model was developed based on certain
selected variables as the input. It achieved an accuracy of over 92.3 percent,
showing Artificial Neural Network potential effectiveness as a predictive tool
and a selection criterion for candidates seeking admission to a university.</span>

therefore, intelligent decision-making is crucial for the performance of
lifelong learning systems. In addition, the order in which samples arrive may
heavily affect the performance of online (and offline) incremental learners.
The recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide
valuable aid in addressing such class of problems. Their primary use-case has
been cluster quality monitoring; nonetheless, they have been very recently
integrated in a streaming clustering method to assist the clustering task
itself. In this context, the work presented here introduces the first adaptive
resonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and
semi-supervised online learning. Moreover, it shows for the first time how to
use iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance via an iCVI-based match tracking mechanism.
The model achieves improved accuracy and robustness to ordering effects by
integrating an online iCVI framework as module B of a topological adaptive
resonance theory predictive mapping (TopoARTMAP) -- thereby being named
iCVI-TopoARTMAP -- and by employing iCVI-driven post-processing heuristics at
the end of each learning step. The online iCVI framework provides assignments
of input samples to clusters at each iteration in accordance to any of several
iCVIs. The iCVI-TopoARTMAP maintains useful properties shared by ARTMAP models,
such as stability, immunity to catastrophic forgetting, and the many-to-one
mapping capability via the map field module. The performance (unsupervised and
semi-supervised) and robustness to presentation order (unsupervised) of
iCVI-TopoARTMAP were evaluated via experiments with a synthetic data set and
deep embeddings of a real-world face image data set.</span>

ranging from data instances, knowledge, constraints, to rewards, adversaries,
and lifelong interplay in an ever-growing spectrum of tasks, contemporary ML/AI
research has resulted in a multitude of learning paradigms and methodologies.
Despite the continual progresses on all different fronts, the disparate

build AI agents that panoramically learn from all types of experiences. This
paper presents a standardized ML formalism, in particular a standard equation
of the learning objective, that offers a unifying understanding of diverse ML

components. The framework also provides guidance for mechanic design of new ML

The renaissance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) over the last
decade is accompanied by an unscalable computational cost, limiting its
advancement and weighing on the field in practice. In this thesis we take a
systematic approach to address the algorithmic and methodological limitations
at the root of these costs. We first demonstrate that DL training and pruning
are predictable and governed by scaling laws -- for state of the art models and
tasks, spanning image classification and language modeling, as well as for
state of the art model compression via iterative pruning. Predictability, via
the establishment of these scaling laws, provides the path for principled
design and trade-off reasoning, currently largely lacking in the field. We then
continue to analyze the sources of the scaling laws, offering an
approximation-theoretic view and showing through the exploration of a noiseless
realizable case that DL is in fact dominated by error sources very far from the
lower error limit. We conclude by building on the gained theoretical
understanding of the scaling laws&#x27; origins. We present a conjectural path to
eliminate one of the current dominant error sources -- through a data bandwidth
limiting hypothesis and the introduction of Nyquist learners -- which can, in
principle, reach the generalization error lower limit (e.g. 0 in the noiseless
case), at finite dataset size.</span>

                                        <span>Using finite-state machines to learn patterns, Tsetlin machines (TMs) have
obtained competitive accuracy and learning speed across several benchmarks,
with frugal memory- and energy footprint. A TM represents patterns as
conjunctive clauses in propositional logic (AND-rules), each clause voting for
or against a particular output. While efficient for single-output problems, one
needs a separate TM per output for multi-output problems. Employing multiple
TMs hinders pattern reuse because each TM then operates in a silo. In this
paper, we introduce clause sharing, merging multiple TMs into a single one.
Each clause is related to each output by using a weight. A positive weight
makes the clause vote for output $1$, while a negative weight makes the clause
vote for output $0$. The clauses thus coalesce to produce multiple outputs. The
resulting coalesced Tsetlin Machine (CoTM) simultaneously learns both the
weights and the composition of each clause by employing interacting Stochastic
Searching on the Line (SSL) and Tsetlin Automata (TA) teams. Our empirical
results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST show that CoTM obtains
significantly higher accuracy than TM on $50$- to $1$K-clause configurations,
indicating an ability to repurpose clauses. E.g., accuracy goes from $71.99$%
to $89.66$% on Fashion-MNIST when employing $50$ clauses per class (22 Kb
memory). While TM and CoTM accuracy is similar when using more than $1$K
clauses per class, CoTM reaches peak accuracy $3\times$ faster on MNIST with
$8$K clauses. We further investigate robustness towards imbalanced training
data. Our evaluations on imbalanced versions of IMDb- and CIFAR10 data show

Classroom Tool that employs EDM techniques for supporting the decision-making
process of educators. REACT is a data-driven tool with a user-friendly
graphical interface. It analyzes students&#x27; performance data and provides
context-based alerts as well as recommendations to educators for course
planning. Furthermore, it incorporates model-agnostic explanations for bringing
explainability and interpretability in the process of decision making. This
paper demonstrates a use case scenario of our proposed tool using a real-world
dataset and presents the design of its architecture and user interface. This
demonstration focuses on the agglomerative clustering of students based on
their performance (i.e., incorrect responses and hints used) during an in-class
activity. This formation of clusters of students with similar strengths and
weaknesses may help educators to improve their course planning by identifying
at-risk students, forming study groups, or encouraging tutoring between
students of different strengths.</span>

approximate the computation implemented by a sensory neuron. Typically, such
STRFs are assumed to be smooth and sparse. Current state-of-the-art approaches
for estimating STRFs based on empirical Bayes are often not computationally
efficient in high-dimensional settings, as encountered in sensory neuroscience.
Here we pursued an alternative approach and encode prior knowledge for
estimation of STRFs by choosing a set of basis functions with the desired
properties: natural cubic splines. Our method is computationally efficient and
can be easily applied to a wide range of existing models. We compared the
performance of spline-based methods to non-spline ones on simulated and

algorithms for collaborative filtering (CF). Nevertheless, the theoretical
underpinnings of their empirical successes remain elusive. In this paper, we
endeavor to obtain a better understanding of GCN-based CF methods via the lens
of graph signal processing. By identifying the critical role of smoothness, a
key concept in graph signal processing, we develop a unified graph
convolution-based framework for CF. We prove that many existing CF methods are
special cases of this framework, including the neighborhood-based methods,
low-rank matrix factorization, linear auto-encoders, and LightGCN,
corresponding to different low-pass filters. Based on our framework, we then
present a simple and computationally efficient CF baseline, which we shall
refer to as Graph Filter based Collaborative Filtering (GF-CF). Given an
implicit feedback matrix, GF-CF can be obtained in a closed form instead of
expensive training with back-propagation. Experiments will show that GF-CF
achieves competitive or better performance against deep learning-based methods
on three well-known datasets, notably with a $70\%$ performance gain over
LightGCN on the Amazon-book dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Graph-based anomaly detection has been widely used for detecting malicious
activities in real-world applications. Existing attempts to address this
problem have thus far focused on structural feature engineering or learning in
the binary classification regime. In this work, we propose to leverage graph
contrastive coding and present the supervised GCCAD model for contrasting
abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of their distances to the global
context (e.g., the average of all nodes). To handle scenarios with scarce
labels, we further enable GCCAD as a self-supervised framework by designing a
graph corrupting strategy for generating synthetic node labels. To achieve the
contrastive objective, we design a graph neural network encoder that can infer
and further remove suspicious links during message passing, as well as learn
the global context of the input graph. We conduct extensive experiments on four
public datasets, demonstrating that 1) GCCAD significantly and consistently
outperforms various advanced baselines and 2) its self-supervised version
without fine-tuning can achieve comparable performance with its fully
supervised version.</span>

                                        <span>Successful sequential recommendation systems rely on accurately capturing the
user&#x27;s short-term and long-term interest. Although Transformer-based models
achieved state-of-the-art performance in the sequential recommendation task,
they generally require quadratic memory and time complexity to the sequence
length, making it difficult to extract the long-term interest of users. On the
other hand, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)-based models, renowned for their
linear memory and time complexity, have recently shown competitive results
compared to Transformer in various tasks. Given the availability of a massive
amount of the user&#x27;s behavior history, the linear memory and time complexity of
MLP-based models make them a promising alternative to explore in the sequential
recommendation task. To this end, we adopted MLP-based models in sequential
recommendation but consistently observed that MLP-based methods obtain lower
performance than those of Transformer despite their computational benefits.
From experiments, we observed that introducing explicit high-order interactions
to MLP layers mitigates such performance gap. In response, we propose the
Multi-Order Interaction (MOI) layer, which is capable of expressing an
arbitrary order of interactions within the inputs while maintaining the memory
and time complexity of the MLP layer. By replacing the MLP layer with the MOI
layer, our model was able to achieve comparable performance with
Transformer-based models while retaining the MLP-based models&#x27; computational
benefits.</span>

                                        <span>Abdominal auscultation is a convenient, safe and inexpensive method to assess
bowel conditions, which is essential in neonatal care. It helps early detection
of neonatal bowel dysfunctions and allows timely intervention. This paper
presents a neonatal bowel sound detection method to assist the auscultation.
Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to classify
peristalsis and non-peristalsis sounds. The classification is then optimized
using a Laplace Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM). The proposed method is
validated on abdominal sounds from 49 newborn infants admitted to our tertiary
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The results show that the method can
effectively detect bowel sounds with accuracy and area under curve (AUC) score
being 89.81% and 83.96% respectively, outperforming 13 baseline methods.
Furthermore, the proposed Laplace HSMM refinement strategy is proven capable to
enhance other bowel sound detection models. The outcomes of this work have the
potential to facilitate future telehealth applications for neonatal care. The

                                        <span>While information delivery in industrial Internet of things demands
reliability and latency guarantees, the freshness of the controller&#x27;s available
information, measured by the age of information (AoI), is paramount for
high-performing industrial automation. The problem in this work is cast as a
sensor&#x27;s transmit power minimization subject to the peak-AoI requirement and a
probabilistic constraint on queuing latency. We further characterize the tail
behavior of the latency by a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) for solving
the power allocation problem through Lyapunov optimization. As each sensor
utilizes its own data to locally train the GPD model, we incorporate federated
learning and propose a local-model selection approach which accounts for
correlation among the sensor&#x27;s training data. Numerical results show the
tradeoff between the transmit power, peak AoI, and delay&#x27;s tail distribution.
Furthermore, we verify the superiority of the proposed correlation-aware
approach for selecting the local models in federated learning over an existing
baseline.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a general meta learning approach to computing
approximate Nash equilibrium for finite $n$-player normal-form games. Unlike
existing solutions that approximate or learn a Nash equilibrium from scratch
for each of the games, our meta solver directly constructs a mapping from a
game utility matrix to a joint strategy profile. The mapping is parameterized
and learned in a self-supervised fashion by a proposed Nash equilibrium
approximation metric without ground truth data informing any Nash equilibrium.
As such, it can immediately predict the joint strategy profile that
approximates a Nash equilibrium for any unseen new game under the same game
distribution. Moreover, the meta-solver can be further fine-tuned and adaptive
to a new game if iteration updates are allowed. We theoretically prove that our
meta-solver is not affected by the non-smoothness of exact Nash equilibrium
solutions, and derive a sample complexity bound to demonstrate its
generalization ability across normal-form games. Experimental results
demonstrate its substantial approximation power against other strong baselines
in both adaptive and non-adaptive cases.</span>

                                        <span>Over a complete Riemannian manifold of finite dimension, Greene and Wu
introduced a convolution, known as Greene-Wu (GW) convolution. In this paper,
we introduce a reformulation of the GW convolution. Using our reformulation,
many properties of the GW convolution can be easily derived, including a new
formula for how the curvature of the space would affect the curvature of the
function through the GW convolution. Also enabled by our new reformulation, an
improved method for gradient estimation over Riemannian manifolds is
introduced. Theoretically, our gradient estimation method improves the order of
estimation error from $O \left( \left( n + 3 \right)^{3/2} \right)$ to $O
\left( n^{3/2} \right)$, where $n$ is the dimension of the manifold.
Empirically, our method outperforms the best existing method for gradient
estimation over Riemannian manifolds, as evidenced by thorough experimental
evaluations.</span>

machine learning has been drawing much attention in both academia and industry.
However, most existing methods have their limitations in practical
applications. On the one hand, although most cryptographic methods are provable
secure, they bring heavy computation and communication. On the other hand, the
security of many relatively efficient private methods (e.g., federated learning
and split learning) is being questioned, since they are non-provable secure.
Inspired by previous work on privacy-preserving machine learning, we build a
privacy-preserving machine learning framework by combining random permutation
and arithmetic secret sharing via our compute-after-permutation technique.
Since our method reduces the cost for element-wise function computation, it is
more efficient than existing cryptographic methods. Moreover, by adopting
distance correlation as a metric for privacy leakage, we demonstrate that our
method is more secure than previous non-provable secure methods. Overall, our
proposal achieves a good balance between security and efficiency. Experimental
results show that our method not only is up to 6x faster and reduces up to 85%
network traffic compared with state-of-the-art cryptographic methods, but also
leaks less privacy during the training process compared with non-provable
secure methods.</span>

biological structure and property of protein sequences is critical to the
exploration of life, as well as disease detection and drug discovery.
Traditional protein analysis methods tend to be labor-intensive and
time-consuming. The emergence of deep learning models makes modeling data
patterns in large quantities of data possible. Interdisciplinary researchers
have begun to leverage deep learning methods to model large biological
datasets, e.g. using long short-term memory and convolutional neural network
for protein sequence classification. After millions of years of evolution,
evolutionary information is encoded in protein sequences. Inspired by the
similarity between natural language and protein sequences, we use large-scale
language models to model evolutionary-scale protein sequences, encoding protein
biology information in representation. Significant improvements are observed in
both token-level and sequence-level tasks, demonstrating that our large-scale
model can accurately capture evolution information from pretraining on
evolutionary-scale individual sequences. Our code and model are available at

by $b$ times, where $b$ is the number of bins when applying one-hot encoding on
each input feature. To reduce the memory cost of SEFM, we propose a new method
called Binarized FM which constraints the model parameters to be binary values
(i.e., 1 or $-1$). Then each parameter value can be efficiently stored in one
bit. Our proposed method can significantly reduce the memory cost of SEFM
model. In addition, we propose a new algorithm to effectively and efficiently
learn proposed FM with binary constraints using Straight Through Estimator
(STE) with Adaptive Gradient Descent (Adagrad). Finally, we evaluate the
performance of our proposed method on eight different classification datasets.
Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves
comparable accuracy with SEFM but with much less memory cost.</span>

                                        <span>We propose contextual convolution (CoConv) for visual recognition. CoConv is
a direct replacement of the standard convolution, which is the core component
of convolutional neural networks. CoConv is implicitly equipped with the
capability of incorporating contextual information while maintaining a similar
number of parameters and computational cost compared to the standard
convolution. CoConv is inspired by neuroscience studies indicating that (i)
neurons, even from the primary visual cortex (V1 area), are involved in
detection of contextual cues and that (ii) the activity of a visual neuron can
be influenced by the stimuli placed entirely outside of its theoretical
receptive field. On the one hand, we integrate CoConv in the widely-used
residual networks and show improved recognition performance over baselines on
the core tasks and benchmarks for visual recognition, namely image
classification on the ImageNet data set and object detection on the MS COCO
data set. On the other hand, we introduce CoConv in the generator of a
state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network, showing improved generative
results on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Our code is available at

to identify specific data subgroups for which the considered algorithm shows
different performance with respect to the entire dataset. The intervention of
domain experts is normally required to identify relevant attributes that define
these subgroups.

We introduce the notion of divergence to measure this performance difference

applications to automatically detect data subgroups showing a significant

attributes in the data subgroup to the divergent behavior by means of Shapley

infeasible tool in some conditions. The self-supervised learning method is
proposed to tackle the learning effectiveness with fewer labeled data, however,
there is a lack of confidence in the size of labeled data needed to achieve
adequate results. This study aims to draw a baseline on the proportion of the
labeled data that models can appreciate to yield competent accuracy when
compared to training with additional labels. The study implements the
kaggle.com&#x27; cats-vs-dogs dataset, Mnist and Fashion-Mnist to investigate the
self-supervised learning task by implementing random rotations augmentation on
the original datasets. To reveal the true effectiveness of the pretext process
in self-supervised learning, the original dataset is divided into smaller
batches, and learning is repeated on each batch with and without the pretext
pre-training. Results show that the pretext process in the self-supervised
learning improves the accuracy around 15% in the downstream classification task
when compared to the plain supervised learning.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm where multiple
data owners (clients) collaboratively train one machine learning model while
keeping data on their own devices. The heterogeneity of client datasets is one
of the most important challenges of federated learning algorithms. Studies have
found performance reduction with standard federated algorithms, such as FedAvg,
on non-IID data. Many existing works on handling non-IID data adopt the same
aggregation framework as FedAvg and focus on improving model updates either on
the server side or on clients. In this work, we tackle this challenge in a
different view by introducing redistribution rounds that delay the aggregation.
We perform experiments on multiple tasks and show that the proposed framework
significantly improves the performance on non-IID data.</span>

architecture to classify received signal samples as coming from one of four
common waveforms, Single Carrier (SC), Single-Carrier Frequency Division
Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM),
and Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM), used in communication and radar
networks. Synchronization of the signals is not needed as we assume there is an
unknown and uncompensated time and frequency offset. An autoencoder with a deep
CNN architecture is also examined to create a new fifth classification category
of an unknown waveform type. This is accomplished by calculating a minimum and
maximum threshold values from the root mean square error (RMSE) of the radar
and communication waveforms. The classifier and autoencoder work together to
monitor a spectrum area to identify the common waveforms inside the area of
operation along with detecting unknown waveforms. Results from testing showed
the classifier had 100\% classification rate above 0 dB with accuracy of 83.2\%
and 94.7\% at -10 dB and -5 dB, respectively, with signal impairments present.
Results for the anomaly detector showed 85.3\% accuracy at 0 dB with 100\% at
SNR greater than 0 dB with signal impairments present when using a high-value
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size. Accurate detection rates decline as
additional noise is introduced to the signals, with 78.1\% at -5 dB and 56.5\%
at -10 dB. However, these low rates seen can be potentially mitigated by using
even higher FFT sizes also shown in our results.</span>

onset of epileptic patients. It is extremely important for drug-refractory
patients. Conventional seizure prediction works usually rely on features
extracted from Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and classification
algorithms such as regression or support vector machine (SVM) to locate the
short time before seizure onset. However, such methods cannot achieve
high-accuracy prediction due to information loss of the hand-crafted features
and the limited classification ability of regression and SVM algorithms. We
propose an end-to-end deep learning solution using a convolutional neural
network (CNN) in this paper. One and two dimensional kernels are adopted in the
early- and late-stage convolution and max-pooling layers, respectively. The
proposed CNN model is evaluated on Kaggle intracranial and CHB-MIT scalp EEG
datasets. Overall sensitivity, false prediction rate, and area under receiver
operating characteristic curve reaches 93.5%, 0.063/h, 0.981 and 98.8%,
0.074/h, 0.988 on two datasets respectively. Comparison with state-of-the-art

                                        <span>Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) refers to a form of tests that are
personalized to every student/test taker. CAT methods adaptively select the
next most informative question/item for each student given their responses to
previous questions, effectively reducing test length. Existing CAT methods use
item response theory (IRT) models to relate student ability to their responses
to questions and static question selection algorithms designed to reduce the
ability estimation error as quickly as possible; therefore, these algorithms
cannot improve by learning from large-scale student response data. In this
paper, we propose BOBCAT, a Bilevel Optimization-Based framework for CAT to
directly learn a data-driven question selection algorithm from training data.
BOBCAT is agnostic to the underlying student response model and is
computationally efficient during the adaptive testing process. Through
extensive experiments on five real-world student response datasets, we show
that BOBCAT outperforms existing CAT methods (sometimes significantly) at
reducing test length.</span>

                                        <span>As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used in more applications, the need to
consider and mitigate biases from the learned models has followed. Most works
in developing fair learning algorithms focus on the offline setting. However,
in many real-world applications data comes in an online fashion and needs to be
processed on the fly. Moreover, in practical application, there is a trade-off
between accuracy and fairness that needs to be accounted for, but current
methods often have multiple hyperparameters with non-trivial interaction to
achieve fairness. In this paper, we propose a flexible ensemble algorithm for
fair decision-making in the more challenging context of evolving online
settings. This algorithm, called FARF (Fair and Adaptive Random Forests), is
based on using online component classifiers and updating them according to the
current distribution, that also accounts for fairness and a single
hyperparameters that alters fairness-accuracy balance. Experiments on
real-world discriminated data streams demonstrate the utility of FARF.</span>

models is a major challenge. In this work, we propose methods to use
group-level binary labels as weak supervision to train instance-level binary
classification models. Aggregate labels are common in several domains where
annotating on a group-level might be cheaper or might be the only way to
provide annotated data without infringing on privacy. We model group-level
labels as Class Conditional Noisy (CCN) labels for individual instances and use
the noisy labels to regularize predictions of the model trained on the
strongly-labeled instances. Our experiments on real-world application of land
cover mapping shows the utility of the proposed method in leveraging
group-level labels, both in the presence and absence of class imbalance.</span>

interpretations that &quot;explain&quot; the behavior of black-box machine learning
models. Constructing human-understandable interpretations for black-box models
often requires balancing conflicting objectives. A simple interpretation may be
easier to understand for humans while being less precise in its predictions
vis-a-vis a complex interpretation. Existing methods for synthesizing
interpretations use a single objective function and are often optimized for a
single class of interpretations. In contrast, we provide a more general and
multi-objective synthesis framework that allows users to choose (1) the class
of syntactic templates from which an interpretation should be synthesized, and
(2) quantitative measures on both the correctness and explainability of an
interpretation. For a given black-box, our approach yields a set of
Pareto-optimal interpretations with respect to the correctness and
explainability measures. We show that the underlying multi-objective
optimization problem can be solved via a reduction to quantitative constraint
solving, such as weighted maximum satisfiability. To demonstrate the benefits
of our approach, we have applied it to synthesize interpretations for black-box
neural-network classifiers. Our experiments show that there often exists a rich
and varied set of choices for interpretations that are missed by existing
approaches.</span>

increased interest in analyzing the properties of their spatial distribution.
Current metrics suggest that contextualized word embedding models do not
uniformly utilize all dimensions when embedding tokens in vector space. Here we
argue that existing metrics are fragile and tend to obfuscate the true spatial
distribution of point clouds. To ameliorate this issue, we propose IsoScore: a
novel metric which quantifies the degree to which a point cloud uniformly
utilizes the ambient vector space. We demonstrate that IsoScore has several
desirable properties such as mean invariance and direct correspondence to the
number of dimensions used, which are properties that existing scores do not
possess. Furthermore, IsoScore is conceptually intuitive and computationally
efficient, making it well suited for analyzing the distribution of point clouds
in arbitrary vector spaces, not necessarily limited to those of word embeddings
alone. Additionally, we use IsoScore to demonstrate that a number of recent
conclusions in the NLP literature that have been derived using brittle metrics
of spatial distribution, such as average cosine similarity, may be incomplete
or altogether inaccurate.</span>

in an asymptotic framework. Our starting point is the formulation of federated
learning as a multi-criterion objective, where the goal is to minimize each
client&#x27;s loss using information from all of the clients. We propose a linear
regression model, where, for a given client, we theoretically compare the
performance of various algorithms in the high-dimensional asymptotic limit.
This asymptotic multi-criterion approach naturally models the high-dimensional,
many-device nature of federated learning and suggests that personalization is
central to federated learning. Our theory suggests that Fine-tuned Federated
Averaging (FTFA), i.e., Federated Averaging followed by local training, and the
ridge regularized variant Ridge-tuned Federated Averaging (RTFA) are
competitive with more sophisticated meta-learning and proximal-regularized
approaches. In addition to being conceptually simpler, FTFA and RTFA are
computationally more efficient than its competitors. We corroborate our
theoretical claims with extensive experiments on federated versions of the

abound in the machine learning and signal processing literature, under the

Notably, we show that the tracking efficiency of the proximal stochastic

                                        <span>In recent years, the US has experienced an opioid epidemic with an
unprecedented number of drugs overdose deaths. Research finds such overdose
deaths are linked to neighborhood-level traits, thus providing opportunity to
identify effective interventions. Typically, techniques such as Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) are used to document
neighborhood-level factors significant in explaining such adverse outcomes.
These techniques are, however, less equipped to ascertain non-linear
relationships between confounding factors. Hence, in this study we apply
machine learning based techniques to identify opioid risks of neighborhoods in
Delaware and explore the correlation of these factors using Shapley Additive
explanations (SHAP). We discovered that the factors related to neighborhoods
environment, followed by education and then crime, were highly correlated with
higher opioid risk. We also explored the change in these correlations over the
years to understand the changing dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, we
discovered that, as the epidemic has shifted from legal (i.e., prescription

correlation of environment, crime and health related variables with the opioid
risk has increased significantly while the correlation of economic and
socio-demographic variables has decreased. The correlation of education related
factors has been higher from the start and has increased slightly in recent
years suggesting a need for increased awareness about the opioid epidemic.</span>

                                        <span>Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and
crucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on
short-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level
predictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level
prediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves
along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic
Segment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be
more specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional
operation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets
adaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be
combined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform
powerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video
architecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several
video recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,
Something-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed
DSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.
For example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is
improved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400. Codes are available at

visual block containing a pretrained 2D-CNN followed by a temporal
convolutional network (TCN); (2) an aural block containing several parallel
TCNs; and (3) a leader-follower attentive fusion block combining the
audio-visual information. The TCN with large history coverage enables our model
to exploit spatial-temporal information within a much larger window length
(i.e., 300) than that from the baseline and state-of-the-art methods (i.e., 36
or 48). The fusion block emphasizes the visual modality while exploits the
noisy aural modality using the inter-modality attention mechanism. To make full
use of the data and alleviate over-fitting, cross-validation is carried out on
the training and validation set. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)
centering is used to merge the results from each fold. On the test (validation)
set of the Aff-Wild2 database, the achieved CCC is 0.463 (0.469) for valence
and 0.492 (0.649) for arousal, which significantly outperforms the baseline
method with the corresponding CCC of 0.200 (0.210) and 0.190 (0.230) for
valence and arousal, respectively. The code is available at

modular method for controlled text generation. Given a pre-existing model G for
generating text from a distribution of interest, FUDGE enables conditioning on
a desired attribute a (for example, formality) while requiring access only to
G&#x27;s output logits. FUDGE learns an attribute predictor operating on a partial
sequence, and uses this predictor&#x27;s outputs to adjust G&#x27;s original
probabilities. We show that FUDGE models terms corresponding to a Bayesian
decomposition of the conditional distribution of G given attribute a. Moreover,
FUDGE can easily compose predictors for multiple desired attributes. We
evaluate FUDGE on three tasks -- couplet completion in poetry, topic control in
language generation, and formality change in machine translation -- and observe
gains in all three tasks.</span>

few-shot text classification. Instead of computing the likelihood of the label
given the input (referred as direct models), channel models compute the
conditional probability of the input given the label, and are thereby required
to explain every word in the input. We use channel models for recently proposed
few-shot learning methods with no or very limited updates to the language model
parameters, via either in-context demonstration or prompt tuning. Our
experiments show that, for both methods, channel models significantly
outperform their direct counterparts, which we attribute to their stability,
i.e., lower variance and higher worst-case accuracy. We also present extensive
ablations that provide recommendations for when to use channel prompt tuning
instead of other competitive models (e.g., direct head tuning): channel prompt
tuning is preferred when the number of training examples is small, labels in
the training data are imbalanced, or generalization to unseen labels is
required.</span>

                                        <span>The newly emerged transformer technology has a tremendous impact on NLP
research. In the general English domain, transformer-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on various NLP benchmarks. In the clinical
domain, researchers also have investigated transformer models for clinical
applications. The goal of this study is to systematically explore three widely
used transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) for clinical
relation extraction and develop an open-source package with clinical
pre-trained transformer-based models to facilitate information extraction in
the clinical domain. We developed a series of clinical RE models based on three
transformer architectures, namely BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We evaluated these
models using 2 publicly available datasets from 2018 MADE1.0 and 2018 n2c2
challenges. We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class
classification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations
in different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three
transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We
demonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance
on the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958. On the 2018 n2c2
dataset, the XLNet-clinical model achieved the best F1-score of 0.9610. Our
results indicated that the binary classification strategy consistently
outperformed the multi-class classification strategy for clinical relation
extraction. Our methods and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerRelationExtraction.
We believe this work will improve current practice on clinical relation
extraction and other related NLP tasks in the biomedical domain.</span>

Speech Translation shared task. Our system is built by leveraging transfer
learning across modalities, tasks and languages. First, we leverage
general-purpose multilingual modules pretrained with large amounts of
unlabelled and labelled data. We further enable knowledge transfer from the
text task to the speech task by training two tasks jointly. Finally, our
multilingual model is finetuned on speech translation task-specific data to
achieve the best translation results. Experimental results show our system
outperforms the reported systems, including both end-to-end and cascaded based

In some translation directions, our speech translation results evaluated on

                                        <span>Subword units are commonly used for end-to-end automatic speech recognition
(ASR), while a fully acoustic-oriented subword modeling approach is somewhat
missing. We propose an acoustic data-driven subword modeling (ADSM) approach
that adapts the advantages of several text-based and acoustic-based subword
methods into one pipeline. With a fully acoustic-oriented label design and
learning process, ADSM produces acoustic-structured subword units and
acoustic-matched target sequence for further ASR training. The obtained ADSM
labels are evaluated with different end-to-end ASR approaches including CTC,
RNN-Transducer and attention models. Experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show
that ADSM clearly outperforms both byte pair encoding (BPE) and
pronunciation-assisted subword modeling (PASM) in all cases. Detailed analysis
shows that ADSM achieves acoustically more logical word segmentation and more
balanced sequence length, and thus, is suitable for both time-synchronous and
label-synchronous models. We also briefly describe how to apply acoustic-based
subword regularization and unseen text segmentation using ADSM.</span>

                                        <span>Large language models have led to state-of-the-art accuracies across a range
of tasks. However, training these models efficiently is challenging for two
reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large
models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations
required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training
times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and
pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these
methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to
expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting
on other devices to make progress.

In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor,
pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs
and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline
parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that
can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing
approaches. We quantitatively study the trade-offs between tensor, pipeline,
and data parallelism, and provide intuition as to how to configure distributed
training of a large model. Our approach allows us to perform training
iterations on a model with 1 trillion parameters at 502 petaFLOP/s on 3072 GPUs
with achieved per-GPU throughput of 52% of theoretical peak. Our code is open

                                        <span>The existence of multiple datasets for sarcasm detection prompts us to apply
transfer learning to exploit their commonality. The adversarial neural transfer
(ANT) framework utilizes multiple loss terms that encourage the source-domain
and the target-domain feature distributions to be similar while optimizing for
domain-specific performance. However, these objectives may be in conflict,
which can lead to optimization difficulties and sometimes diminished transfer.
We propose a generalized latent optimization strategy that allows different
losses to accommodate each other and improves training dynamics. The proposed
method outperforms transfer learning and meta-learning baselines. In
particular, we achieve 10.02% absolute performance gain over the previous state
of the art on the iSarcasm dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Since the introduction of the original BERT (i.e., BASE BERT), researchers
have developed various customized BERT models with improved performance for
specific domains and tasks by exploiting the benefits of {\em transfer
learning}. Due to the nature of mathematical texts, which often use domain
specific vocabulary along with equations and math symbols, we posit that the
development of a new BERT model for mathematics would be useful for many
mathematical downstream tasks. In this resource paper, we introduce our
multi-institutional effort (i.e., two learning platforms and three academic
institutions in the US) toward this need: MathBERT, a model created by
pre-training the BASE BERT model on a large mathematical corpus ranging from
pre-kindergarten (pre-k), to high-school, to college graduate level
mathematical content. In addition, we select three general NLP tasks that are
often used in mathematics education: prediction of knowledge component,
auto-grading open-ended Q\&amp;A, and knowledge tracing, to demonstrate the
superiority of MathBERT over BASE BERT. Our experiments show that MathBERT
outperforms prior best methods by 1.2-22\% and BASE BERT by 2-8\% on these
tasks. In addition, we build a mathematics specific vocabulary &#x60;mathVocab&#x27; to
train with MathBERT. We discover that MathBERT pre-trained with &#x60;mathVocab&#x27;
outperforms MathBERT trained with the BASE BERT vocabulary (i.e., &#x60;origVocab&#x27;).
MathBERT is currently being adopted at the participated leaning platforms:
Stride, Inc, a commercial educational resource provider, and ASSISTments.org, a
free online educational platform. We release MathBERT for public usage at:

                                        <span>Methods and Materials: We investigated transferability of neural
network-based de-identification sys-tems with and without domain
generalization. We used two domain generalization approaches: a novel approach
Joint-Domain Learning (JDL) as developed in this paper, and a state-of-the-art
domain general-ization approach Common-Specific Decomposition (CSD) from the
literature. First, we measured trans-ferability from a single external source.
Second, we used two external sources and evaluated whether domain
generalization can improve transferability of de-identification models across
domains which rep-resent different note types from the same institution. Third,
using two external sources with in-domain training data, we studied whether
external source data are useful even in cases where sufficient in-domain
training data are available. Finally, we investigated transferability of the
de-identification mod-els across institutions. Results and Conclusions: We
found transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent re-sults.
Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of
approximately 80%, but domain generalization was not always helpful to improve
transferability. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases
where in-domain training data were available by reducing the amount of needed
in-domain training data or by improving performance. Transferability across
institutions was differed by note type and annotation label. External sources
from a different institution were also useful to further improve performance.</span>

capabilities, including zero and few-shot translation between low-resource
language pairs. However, these models are often evaluated on high-resource
languages with the assumption that they generalize to low-resource ones. The
difficulty of evaluating MT models on low-resource pairs is often due to lack
of standardized evaluation datasets. In this paper, we present MENYO-20k, the
first multi-domain parallel corpus with a special focus on clean orthography
for Yor\&#x60;ub\&#x27;a--English with standardized train-test splits for benchmarking.
We provide several neural MT benchmarks and compare them to the performance of
popular pre-trained (massively multilingual) MT models both for the
heterogeneous test set and its subdomains. Since these pre-trained models use
huge amounts of data with uncertain quality, we also analyze the effect of
diacritics, a major characteristic of Yor\&#x60;ub\&#x27;a, in the training data. We
investigate how and when this training condition affects the final quality and
intelligibility of a translation. Our models outperform massively multilingual
models such as Google ($+8.7$ BLEU) and Facebook M2M ($+9.1$ BLEU) when
translating to Yor\&#x60;ub\&#x27;a, setting a high quality benchmark for future
research.</span>

                                        <span>The mainstream image captioning models rely on Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) image features to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, image
scene graphs have been used to augment captioning models so as to leverage
their structural semantics, such as object entities, relationships and
attributes. Several studies have noted that the naive use of scene graphs from
a black-box scene graph generator harms image captioning performance and that
scene graph-based captioning models have to incur the overhead of explicit use
of image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we
propose \textbf{SG2Caps}, a framework that utilizes only the scene graph labels
for competitive image captioning performance. The basic idea is to close the
semantic gap between the two scene graphs - one derived from the input image
and the other from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the
spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an
additional HOI graph. SG2Caps outperforms existing scene graph-only captioning
models by a large margin, indicating scene graphs as a promising representation
for image captioning. Direct utilization of scene graph labels avoids expensive
graph convolutions over high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49% fewer
trainable parameters. Our code is available at:

                                        <span>Grounding language queries in videos aims at identifying the time interval
(or moment) semantically relevant to a language query. The solution to this
challenging task demands understanding videos&#x27; and queries&#x27; semantic content
and the fine-grained reasoning about their multi-modal interactions. Our key
idea is to recast this challenge into an algorithmic graph matching problem.
Fueled by recent advances in Graph Neural Networks, we propose to leverage
Graph Convolutional Networks to model video and textual information as well as
their semantic alignment. To enable the mutual exchange of information across
the modalities, we design a novel Video-Language Graph Matching Network
(VLG-Net) to match video and query graphs. Core ingredients include
representation graphs built atop video snippets and query tokens separately and
used to model intra-modality relationships. A Graph Matching layer is adopted
for cross-modal context modeling and multi-modal fusion. Finally, moment
candidates are created using masked moment attention pooling by fusing the
moment&#x27;s enriched snippet features. We demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art grounding methods on three widely used datasets for temporal
localization of moments in videos with language queries: ActivityNet-Captions,
TACoS, and DiDeMo.</span>

                                        <span>The choice of token vocabulary affects the performance of machine
translation. This paper aims to figure out what is a good vocabulary and
whether one can find the optimal vocabulary without trial training. To answer
these questions, we first provide an alternative understanding of the role of
vocabulary from the perspective of information theory. Motivated by this, we
formulate the quest of vocabularization -- finding the best token dictionary
with a proper size -- as an optimal transport (OT) problem. We propose VOLT, a
simple and efficient solution without trial training. Empirical results show
that VOLT outperforms widely-used vocabularies in diverse scenarios, including
WMT-14 English-German and TED&#x27;s 52 translation directions. For example, VOLT
achieves almost 70% vocabulary size reduction and 0.5 BLEU gain on
English-German translation. Also, compared to BPE-search, VOLT reduces the
search time from 384 GPU hours to 30 GPU hours on English-German translation.

itself as possessing a set of human qualities, which is termed as the brand
personality of the company. The perception is impressed upon the consumer
through the content, be it in the form of advertisement, blogs or magazines,
produced by the organization. A consistent brand will generate trust and retain
customers over time as they develop an affinity towards regularity and common
patterns. However, maintaining a consistent messaging tone for a brand has
become more challenging with the virtual explosion in the amount of content
which needs to be authored and pushed to the Internet to maintain an edge in
the era of digital marketing. To understand the depth of the problem, we
collect around 300K web page content from around 650 companies. We develop
trait-specific classification models by considering the linguistic features of
the content. The classifier automatically identifies the web articles which are
not consistent with the mission and vision of a company and further helps us to
discover the conditions under which the consistency cannot be maintained. To
address the brand inconsistency issue, we then develop a sentence ranking
system that outputs the top three sentences that need to be changed for making
a web article more consistent with the company&#x27;s brand personality.</span>

                                        <span>Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) aims to learn generic multimodal
representations from massive image-text pairs. While various successful
attempts have been proposed, learning fine-grained semantic alignments between
image-text pairs plays a key role in their approaches. Nevertheless, most
existing VLP approaches have not fully utilized the intrinsic knowledge within
the image-text pairs, which limits the effectiveness of the learned alignments
and further restricts the performance of their models. To this end, we
introduce a new VLP method called ROSITA, which integrates the cross- and
intra-modal knowledge in a unified scene graph to enhance the semantic
alignments. Specifically, we introduce a novel structural knowledge masking
(SKM) strategy to use the scene graph structure as a priori to perform masked
language (region) modeling, which enhances the semantic alignments by
eliminating the interference information within and across modalities.
Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive analysis verifies the
effectiveness of ROSITA in semantic alignments. Pretrained with both in-domain
and out-of-domain datasets, ROSITA significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art VLP methods on three typical vision-and-language tasks over
six benchmark datasets.</span>

information to understand and interpret music communication. Conventional
natural language processing approaches use translation of the Hindi text into
English for analysis. This approach is not suitable for lyrics as it is likely
to lose the inherent intended contextual meaning. Thus, the need was identified
to develop a system for Devanagari text analysis. The data set of 300 song
lyrics with equal distribution in five different moods is used for the
experimentation. The proposed system performs contextual mood analysis of Hindi
song lyrics in Devanagari text format. The contextual analysis is stored as a
knowledge base, updated using an incremental learning approach with new data.
Contextual knowledge graph with moods and associated important contextual terms
provides the graphical representation of the lyric data set used. The testing
results show 64% accuracy for the mood prediction. This work can be easily
extended to applications related to Hindi literary work such as summarization,
indexing, contextual retrieval, context-based classification and grouping of
documents.</span>

adaptation to specific user groups and personalization, out-of-domain
detection, require extensive and flexible datasets for experiments and
evaluation. As collecting such datasets is time- and labor-consuming, we
propose to use text generation methods to gather datasets. The generator should
be trained to generate utterances that belong to the given intent. We explore
two approaches to generating task-oriented utterances. In the zero-shot
approach, the model is trained to generate utterances from seen intents and is
further used to generate utterances for intents unseen during training. In the
one-shot approach, the model is presented with a single utterance from a test
intent. We perform a thorough automatic, and human evaluation of the dataset
generated utilizing two proposed approaches. Our results reveal that the
attributes of the generated data are close to original test sets, collected via
crowd-sourcing.</span>

associated with retrieved neighbors are edited to form new structures, have
recently attracted increased interest. However, much recent work merely
conditions on retrieved structures (e.g., in a sequence-to-sequence framework),
rather than explicitly manipulating them. We show we can perform accurate
sequence labeling by explicitly (and only) copying labels from retrieved
neighbors. Moreover, because this copying is label-agnostic, we can achieve
impressive performance in zero-shot sequence-labeling tasks. We additionally
consider a dynamic programming approach to sequence labeling in the presence of
retrieved neighbors, which allows for controlling the number of distinct
(copied) segments used to form a prediction, and leads to both more
interpretable and accurate predictions.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a novel interpretable deep neural network for text classification,
called ProtoryNet, based on a new concept of prototype trajectories. Motivated
by the prototype theory in modern linguistics, ProtoryNet makes a prediction by
finding the most similar prototype for each sentence in a text sequence and
feeding an RNN backbone with the proximity of each sentence to the
corresponding active prototype. The RNN backbone then captures the temporal
pattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.
Prototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the
reasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.
We also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of
prototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on
multiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the
baseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap
compared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype
pruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20
prototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.
Furthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find
ProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based
methods.</span>

languages into a new and severely low resource language. Most human translation
efforts adopt a portion-based approach to translate consecutive pages/chapters
in order, which may not suit machine translation. We compare the portion-based
approach that optimizes coherence of the text locally with the random sampling
approach that increases coverage of the text globally. Our results show that
the random sampling approach performs better. When training on a seed corpus of
~1,000 lines from the Bible and testing on the rest of the Bible (~30,000
lines), random sampling gives a performance gain of +11.0 BLEU using English as
a simulated low resource language, and +4.9 BLEU using Eastern Pokomchi, a
Mayan language. Furthermore, we compare three ways of updating machine
translation models with increasing amount of human post-edited data through
iterations. We find that adding newly post-edited data to training after
vocabulary update without self-supervision performs the best. We propose an

dialogue system, expects a shorter inference latency due to the impatience of
humans. Non-autoregressive SLU models clearly increase the inference speed but
suffer uncoordinated-slot problems caused by the lack of sequential dependency
information among each slot chunk. To gap this shortcoming, in this paper, we
propose a novel non-autoregressive SLU model named Layered-Refine Transformer,
which contains a Slot Label Generation (SLG) task and a Layered Refine
Mechanism (LRM). SLG is defined as generating the next slot label with the
token sequence and generated slot labels. With SLG, the non-autoregressive
model can efficiently obtain dependency information during training and spend
no extra time in inference. LRM predicts the preliminary SLU results from
Transformer&#x27;s middle states and utilizes them to guide the final prediction.
Experiments on two public datasets indicate that our model significantly
improves SLU performance (1.5\% on Overall accuracy) while substantially speed
up (more than 10 times) the inference process over the state-of-the-art
baseline.</span>

Intelligence Challenge is designed to comprehensively evaluate information
extraction from different dimensions. It consists of an multiple slots relation
extraction subtask and two event extraction subtasks that extract events from
both sentence-level and document-level. Here we describe our system for this
multi-format information extraction competition task. Specifically, for the
relation extraction subtask, we convert it to a traditional triple extraction
task and design a voting based method that makes full use of existing models.
For the sentence-level event extraction subtask, we convert it to a NER task
and use a pointer labeling based method for extraction. Furthermore,
considering the annotated trigger information may be helpful for event
extraction, we design an auxiliary trigger recognition model and use the
multi-task learning mechanism to integrate the trigger features into the event
extraction model. For the document-level event extraction subtask, we design an
Encoder-Decoder based method and propose a Transformer-alike decoder.
Finally,our system ranks No.4 on the test set leader-board of this multi-format
information extraction task, and its F1 scores for the subtasks of relation
extraction, event extractions of sentence-level and document-level are 79.887%,
85.179%, and 70.828% respectively. The codes of our model are available at

                                        <span>Tables are often created with hierarchies, but existing works on table
reasoning mainly focus on flat tables and neglect hierarchical tables.
Hierarchical tables challenge existing methods by hierarchical indexing, as
well as implicit relationships of calculation and semantics. This work presents
HiTab, a free and open dataset for the research community to study question
answering (QA) and natural language generation (NLG) over hierarchical tables.
HiTab is a cross-domain dataset constructed from a wealth of statistical
reports and Wikipedia pages, and has unique characteristics: (1) nearly all
tables are hierarchical, and (2) both target sentences for NLG and questions
for QA are revised from high-quality descriptions in statistical reports that
are meaningful and diverse. (3) HiTab provides fine-grained annotations on both
entity and quantity alignment. Targeting hierarchical structure, we devise a
novel hierarchy-aware logical form for symbolic reasoning over tables, which
shows high effectiveness. Then given annotations of entity and quantity
alignment, we propose partially supervised training, which helps models to
largely reduce spurious predictions in the QA task. In the NLG task, we find
that entity and quantity alignment also helps NLG models to generate better
results in a conditional generation setting. Experiment results of
state-of-the-art baselines suggest that this dataset presents a strong
challenge and a valuable benchmark for future research.</span>

pre-trained language models (PLMs), we have designed several tasks of
arithmetic and logical reasoning. We both analyse how well PLMs generalize when
the test data is in the same distribution as the train data and when it is
different, for the latter analysis, we have also designed a cross-distribution
test set other than the in-distribution test set. We conduct experiments on one
of the most advanced and publicly released generative PLM - BART. Our research
finds that the PLMs can easily generalize when the distribution is the same,
however, it is still difficult for them to generalize out of the distribution.</span>

can bring multiple benefits to speller and other search components, which is
particularly true for the most commonly deployed noisy-channel based speller
systems. With rapid development of deep learning and substantial advancement in
contextual representation learning such as BERTology, building a decent
misspelling detector without having to rely on hand-crafted features associated
with noisy-channel architecture becomes more-than-ever accessible. However
BERTolgy models are trained with natural language corpus but Maps Search is
highly domain specific, would BERTology continue its success. In this paper we
design 4 stages of models for misspeling detection ranging from the most basic
LSTM to single-domain augmented fine-tuned BERT. We found for Maps Search in
our case, other advanced BERTology family model such as RoBERTa does not
necessarily outperform BERT, and a classic cross-domain fine-tuned full BERT
even underperforms a smaller single-domain fine-tuned BERT. We share more
findings through comprehensive modeling experiments and analysis, we also
briefly cover the data generation algorithm breakthrough.</span>

                                        <span>Named entity recognition (NER) is usually developed and tested on text from
well-written sources. However, in intelligent voice assistants, where NER is an
important component, input to NER may be noisy because of user or speech
recognition error. In applications, entity labels may change frequently, and
non-textual properties like topicality or popularity may be needed to choose
among alternatives.

We describe a NER system intended to address these problems. We test and
train this system on a proprietary user-derived dataset. We compare with a
baseline text-only NER system; the baseline enhanced with external gazetteers;
and the baseline enhanced with the search and indirect labelling techniques we
describe below. The final configuration gives around 6% reduction in NER error
rate. We also show that this technique improves related tasks, such as semantic
parsing, with an improvement of up to 5% in error rate.</span>

knowledge base (KB). Early studies mainly focused on answering simple questions
over KBs and achieved great success. However, their performance on complex
questions is still far from satisfactory. Therefore, in recent years,
researchers propose a large number of novel methods, which looked into the
challenges of answering complex questions. In this survey, we review recent
advances on KBQA with the focus on solving complex questions, which usually
contain multiple subjects, express compound relations, or involve numerical
operations. In detail, we begin with introducing the complex KBQA task and
relevant background. Then, we describe benchmark datasets for complex KBQA task
and introduce the construction process of these datasets. Next, we present two
mainstream categories of methods for complex KBQA, namely semantic
parsing-based (SP-based) methods and information retrieval-based (IR-based)
methods. Specifically, we illustrate their procedures with flow designs and
discuss their major differences and similarities. After that, we summarize the
challenges that these two categories of methods encounter when answering
complex questions, and explicate advanced solutions and techniques used in
existing work. Finally, we conclude and discuss several promising directions
related to complex KBQA for future research.</span>

                                        <span>Public security vulnerability reports (e.g., CVE reports) play an important
role in the maintenance of computer and network systems. Security companies and
administrators rely on information from these reports to prioritize tasks on
developing and deploying patches to their customers. Since these reports are
unstructured texts, automatic information extraction (IE) can help scale up the
processing by converting the unstructured reports to structured forms, e.g.,
software names and versions and vulnerability types. Existing works on
automated IE for security vulnerability reports often rely on a large number of
labeled training samples. However, creating massive labeled training set is
both expensive and time consuming. In this work, for the first time, we propose
to investigate this problem where only a small number of labeled training
samples are available. In particular, we investigate the performance of
fine-tuning several state-of-the-art pre-trained language models on our small
training dataset. The results show that with pre-trained language models and
carefully tuned hyperparameters, we have reached or slightly outperformed the
state-of-the-art system on this task. Consistent with previous two-step process
of first fine-tuning on main category and then transfer learning to others as
in [7], if otherwise following our proposed approach, the number of required
labeled samples substantially decrease in both stages: 90% reduction in
fine-tuning from 5758 to 576,and 88.8% reduction in transfer learning with 64
labeled samples per category. Our experiments thus demonstrate the
effectiveness of few-sample learning on NER for security vulnerability report.
This result opens up multiple research opportunities for few-sample learning
for security vulnerability reports, which is discussed in the paper. Code:

text generation. Large-scale pretrained language models have led to dramatic
improvements in few-shot text generation. Nonetheless, almost all previous work
simply applies random sampling to select the few-shot training instances.
Little to no attention has been paid to the selection strategies and how they
would affect model performance. The study of the selection strategy can help us
to (1) make the most use of our annotation budget in downstream tasks and (2)
better benchmark few-shot text generative models. We welcome submissions that
present their selection strategies and the effects on the generation quality.</span>

predictions for semantically similar contexts, is a highly desirable property
for a sound language understanding model. Although recent pretrained language
models (PLMs) deliver outstanding performance in various downstream tasks, they
should exhibit consistent behaviour provided the models truly understand
language. In this paper, we propose a simple framework named consistency
analysis on language understanding models (CALUM)} to evaluate the model&#x27;s
lower-bound consistency ability. Through experiments, we confirmed that current
PLMs are prone to generate inconsistent predictions even for semantically
identical inputs. We also observed that multi-task training with paraphrase
identification tasks is of benefit to improve consistency, increasing the
consistency by 13% on average.</span>

not meet the standards of human reading comprehension, thus limiting the
understanding of the model, and also the omission or misjudgment of the answer

engagement on these platforms via comments and reactions. A large portion of
such textual comments are abusive, rude and offensive to the audience. With
machine learning systems in-place to check such comments coming onto platform,
biases present in the training data gets passed onto the classifier leading to
discrimination against a set of classes, religion and gender. In this work, we
evaluate different classifiers and feature to estimate the bias in these
classifiers along with their performance on downstream task of toxicity
classification. Results show that improvement in performance of automatic toxic
comment detection models is positively correlated to mitigating biases in these
models. In our work, LSTM with attention mechanism proved to be a better
modelling strategy than a CNN model. Further analysis shows that fasttext
embeddings is marginally preferable than glove embeddings on training models
for toxicity comment detection. Deeper analysis reveals the findings that such
automatic models are particularly biased to specific identity groups even
though the model has a high AUC score. Finally, in effort to mitigate bias in
toxicity detection models, a multi-task setup trained with auxiliary task of
toxicity sub-types proved to be useful leading to upto 0.26% (6% relative) gain
in AUC scores.</span>

                                        <span>More recently, an Approximate SVD Based on Qatar Riyal (QR) Decomposition
(CSVD-QR) method for matrix complete problem is presented, whose computational
complexity is $O(r^2(m+n))$, which is mainly due to that $r$ is far less than
$\min\{m,n\}$, where $r$ represents the largest number of singular values of
matrix $X$. What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the
nuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as
the upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its
decomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear
norm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal
matrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the
singular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
literature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.
Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model
based on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,
which is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding complex social interactions among agents is a key challenge for
trajectory prediction. Most existing methods consider the interactions between
pairwise traffic agents or in a local area, while the nature of interactions is
unlimited, involving an uncertain number of agents and non-local areas
simultaneously. Besides, they treat heterogeneous traffic agents the same,
namely those among agents of different categories, while neglecting people&#x27;s
diverse reaction patterns toward traffic agents in ifferent categories. To
address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective Unlimited
Neighborhood Interaction Network (UNIN), which predicts trajectories of
heterogeneous agents in multiple categories. Specifically, the proposed
unlimited neighborhood interaction module generates the fused-features of all
agents involved in an interaction simultaneously, which is adaptive to any
number of agents and any range of interaction area. Meanwhile, a hierarchical
graph attention module is proposed to obtain category-to-category interaction
and agent-to-agent interaction. Finally, parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model
are estimated for generating the future trajectories. Extensive experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement
of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Visual engagement in social media platforms comprises interactions with photo
posts including comments, shares, and likes. In this paper, we leverage such
visual engagement clues as supervisory signals for representation learning.
However, learning from engagement signals is non-trivial as it is not clear how
to bridge the gap between low-level visual information and high-level social
interactions. We present VisE, a weakly supervised learning approach, which
maps social images to pseudo labels derived by clustered engagement signals. We
then study how models trained in this way benefit subjective downstream
computer vision tasks such as emotion recognition or political bias detection.
Through extensive studies, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of VisE
across a diverse set of classification tasks beyond the scope of conventional
recognition.</span>

                                        <span>Over the last few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved to
reach super-human performance in visual recognition tasks. However, CNNs can
easily be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., maliciously-crafted images that
force the networks to predict an incorrect output while being extremely similar
to those for which a correct output is predicted. Regular adversarial examples
are not robust to input image transformations, which can then be used to detect
whether an adversarial example is presented to the network. Nevertheless, it is
still possible to generate adversarial examples that are robust to such
transformations.

This paper extensively explores the detection of adversarial examples via
image transformations and proposes a novel methodology, called \textit{defense
perturbation}, to detect robust adversarial examples with the same input
transformations the adversarial examples are robust to. Such a \textit{defense
perturbation} is shown to be an effective counter-measure to robust adversarial
examples.

Furthermore, multi-network adversarial examples are introduced. This kind of
adversarial examples can be used to simultaneously fool multiple networks,
which is critical in systems that use network redundancy, such as those based
on architectures with majority voting over multiple CNNs. An extensive set of
experiments based on state-of-the-art CNNs trained on the Imagenet dataset is
finally reported.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to strengthen the performance of novel
object detection with few labeled samples. To alleviate the constraint of few
samples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel
objects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process of FSOD should
focus more on intrinsical object characteristics, which are invariant under
different visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization.
Unlike previous attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we
explore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that
are universal across different object categories. We propose a new prototype,
namely universal prototype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides
the advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal
prototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After
enhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a
consistency loss to maximize the agreement between the enhanced features and
the original ones, which is beneficial for learning invariant object
characteristics. Thus, we develop a new framework of few-shot object detection
with universal prototypes ({FSOD}^{up}) that owns the merit of feature
generalization towards novel objects. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS
COCO show the effectiveness of {FSOD}^{up}. Particularly, for the 1-shot case
of VOC Split2, {FSOD}^{up} outperforms the baseline by 6.8% in terms of mAP.</span>

audio or text has become an emerging and promising research topic. In this
paper, we present a novel approach to synthesize video from the text. The
method builds a phoneme-pose dictionary and trains a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to generate video from interpolated phoneme poses. Compared to
audio-driven video generation algorithms, our approach has a number of
advantages: 1) It only needs a fraction of the training data used by an
audio-driven approach; 2) It is more flexible and not subject to vulnerability
due to speaker variation; 3) It significantly reduces the preprocessing,
training and inference time. We perform extensive experiments to compare the

advancements, reliable visual scene understanding requires comprehensive image
understanding on recognition-level but also cognition-level, which calls for
exploiting the multi-source information as well as learning different levels of
understanding and extensive commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose a
novel Cognitive Attention Network (CAN) for visual commonsense reasoning to

Second, a novel inference module is designed to encode commonsense among image,

                                        <span>The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), which is a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
based statistical model that represents a 3D face using linear basis functions,
has shown promising results for reconstructing 3D faces from single-view
in-the-wild images. However, 3DMM has restricted representation power due to
the limited number of 3D scans and the global linear basis. To address the
limitations of 3DMM, we propose a straightforward learning-based method that
reconstructs a 3D face mesh through Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for the first
time. FFD is a geometric modeling method that embeds a reference mesh within a
parallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by moving the sparse control points of
the grid. As FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions, it has no
limitation in representation power. Thus, we can recover accurate 3D face
meshes by estimating appropriate deviation of control points as deformation
parameters. Although both 3DMM and FFD are parametric models, it is difficult
to predict the effect of the 3DMM parameters on the face shape, while the
deformation parameters of FFD are interpretable in terms of their effect on the
final shape of the mesh. This practical advantage of FFD allows the resulting
mesh and control points to serve as a good starting point for 3D face modeling,
in that ordinary users can fine-tune the mesh by using widely available 3D
software tools. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate how our method
successfully estimates the 3D face geometry and facial expressions from 2D face
images, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

predominately still relies on many high-quality training examples per object
category. In contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could
enable many impactful applications from robotics to user personalization. Most
few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that
lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the
real-world. To close this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark,
grounded in the real-world application of teachable object recognizers for
people who are blind/low-vision. The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486
objects recorded by people who are blind/low-vision on their mobile phones. The
benchmark reflects a realistic, highly challenging recognition problem,
providing a rich playground to drive research in robustness to few-shot,
high-variation conditions. We set the benchmark&#x27;s first state-of-the-art and

                                        <span>Point clouds acquired from scanning devices are often perturbed by noise,
which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The
distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set
of noise-free samples $p(x)$ convolved with some noise model $n$, leading to
$(p * n)(x)$ whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy
point cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from $p *
n$ via gradient ascent -- iteratively updating each point&#x27;s position. Since $p
* n$ is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of
the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural
network architecture to estimate the score of $p * n$ given only noisy point
clouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and
develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under
a variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks
such as point cloud upsampling. The code is available at

                                        <span>In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for
person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for
target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,
where the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target
with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main
limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative
features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder
knowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of
technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise
contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature
learning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the
unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)
strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.
Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class
separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier
space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the
learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the
state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,
surpassing MMT largely by 8.1\%, 9.9\%, 11.4\% and 11.1\% mAP on the
Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks,
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>While the untargeted black-box transferability of adversarial perturbations
has been extensively studied before, changing an unseen model&#x27;s decisions to a
specific &#x60;targeted&#x27; class remains a challenging feat. In this paper, we propose
a new generative approach for highly transferable targeted perturbations
(\ours). We note that the existing methods are less suitable for this task due
to their reliance on class-boundary information that changes from one model to
another, thus reducing transferability. In contrast, our approach matches the
perturbed image &#x60;distribution&#x27; with that of the target class, leading to high
targeted transferability rates. To this end, we propose a new objective
function that not only aligns the global distributions of source and target
images, but also matches the local neighbourhood structure between the two
domains. Based on the proposed objective, we train a generator function that
can adaptively synthesize perturbations specific to a given input. Our
generative approach is independent of the source or target domain labels, while
consistently performs well against state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of
attack settings. As an example, we achieve $32.63\%$ target transferability
from (an adversarially weak) VGG19$_{BN}$ to (a strong) WideResNet on ImageNet
val. set, which is 4$\times$ higher than the previous best generative attack
and 16$\times$ better than instance-specific iterative attack. Code is

                                        <span>Human behavior understanding with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of great
significance for a wide range of applications, which simultaneously brings an
urgent demand of large, challenging, and comprehensive benchmarks for the
development and evaluation of UAV-based models. However, existing benchmarks
have limitations in terms of the amount of captured data, types of data
modalities, categories of provided tasks, and diversities of subjects and
environments. Here we propose a new benchmark - UAVHuman - for human behavior
understanding with UAVs, which contains 67,428 multi-modal video sequences and
119 subjects for action recognition, 22,476 frames for pose estimation, 41,290
frames and 1,144 identities for person re-identification, and 22,263 frames for
attribute recognition. Our dataset was collected by a flying UAV in multiple
urban and rural districts in both daytime and nighttime over three months,
hence covering extensive diversities w.r.t subjects, backgrounds,
illuminations, weathers, occlusions, camera motions, and UAV flying attitudes.
Such a comprehensive and challenging benchmark shall be able to promote the
research of UAV-based human behavior understanding, including action
recognition, pose estimation, re-identification, and attribute recognition.
Furthermore, we propose a fisheye-based action recognition method that
mitigates the distortions in fisheye videos via learning unbounded
transformations guided by flat RGB videos. Experiments show the efficacy of our
method on the UAV-Human dataset. The project page:

configurations of rotation, translation, and size for object instances observed
in single, arbitrary views of cluttered scenes. In this paper, we propose a new
method of Dual Pose Network with refined learning of pose consistency for this
task, shortened as DualPoseNet. DualPoseNet stacks two parallel pose decoders
on top of a shared pose encoder, where the implicit decoder predicts object
poses with a working mechanism different from that of the explicit one; they
thus impose complementary supervision on the training of pose encoder. We
construct the encoder based on spherical convolutions, and design a module of
Spherical Fusion wherein for a better embedding of pose-sensitive features from
the appearance and shape observations. Given no testing CAD models, it is the
novel introduction of the implicit decoder that enables the refined pose
prediction during testing, by enforcing the predicted pose consistency between
the two decoders using a self-adaptive loss term. Thorough experiments on
benchmarks of both category- and instance-level object pose datasets confirm
efficacy of our designs. DualPoseNet outperforms existing methods with a large
margin in the regime of high precision. Our code is released publicly at

images with high efficiency. This optimal efficiency is achieved by exploiting
wavelet decomposition, which is integrated in a fully differentiable
encoder-decoder architecture. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct
high-fidelity depth maps by predicting sparse wavelet coefficients. In contrast
with previous works, we show that wavelet coefficients can be learned without
direct supervision on coefficients. Instead we supervise only the final depth
image that is reconstructed through the inverse wavelet transform. We
additionally show that wavelet coefficients can be learned in fully
self-supervised scenarios, without access to ground-truth depth. Finally, we
apply our method to different state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation
models, in each case giving similar or better results compared to the original
model, while requiring less than half the multiply-adds in the decoder network.

                                        <span>Deep learning based methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have been successfully applied in the field of single image super-resolution
(SISR). To obtain better fidelity and visual quality, most of existing networks
are of heavy design with massive computation. However, the computation
resources of modern mobile devices are limited, which cannot easily support the
expensive cost. To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware
dynamic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its
coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. In practice, the
high-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the
lower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the
computation burden. Since pixels or image patches belong to low-frequency areas
contain relatively few textural details, this dynamic network will not affect
the quality of resulting super-resolution images. In addition, we embed
predictors into the proposed dynamic network to end-to-end fine-tune the
handcrafted frequency-aware masks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark
SISR models and datasets show that the frequency-aware dynamic network can be
employed for various SISR neural architectures to obtain the better tradeoff
between visual quality and computational complexity. For instance, we can
reduce the FLOPs of SR models by approximate 50% while preserving
state-of-the-art SISR performance.</span>

                                        <span>Monocular depth inference has gained tremendous attention from researchers in
recent years and remains as a promising replacement for expensive
time-of-flight sensors, but issues with scale acquisition and implementation
overhead still plague these systems. To this end, this work presents an
unsupervised learning framework that is able to predict at-scale depth maps and
egomotion, in addition to camera intrinsics, from a sequence of monocular
images via a single network. Our method incorporates both spatial and temporal
geometric constraints to resolve depth and pose scale factors, which are
enforced within the supervisory reconstruction loss functions at training time.
Only unlabeled stereo sequences are required for training the weights of our
single-network architecture, which reduces overall implementation overhead as
compared to previous methods. Our results demonstrate strong performance when
compared to the current state-of-the-art on multiple sequences of the KITTI
driving dataset and can provide faster training times with its reduced network
complexity.</span>

                                        <span>The aim of this paper is to map agricultural crops by classifying satellite
image time series. Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels
that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like
orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We
develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and
significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The three-level label
hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN),
such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of
granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture
allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g.,
apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting
classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling
at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according
to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are
sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very
uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that
we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km x 48 km in the Swiss cantons
of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116&#x27;000 individual fields spanning 48
crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We
compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines,
including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions. The hierarchical
approach performs superior by at least 9.9 percentage points in F1-score.</span>

                                        <span>The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene
with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are
excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene
content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling
by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because
rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times.
Our solution, which we call &quot;mip-NeRF&quot; (a la &quot;mipmap&quot;), extends NeRF to
represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering
anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable
aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF&#x27;s ability to represent fine
details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to
NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with
NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we
present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force
supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.</span>

which hamper the social and economic activities and may threaten the
infrastructure and lives. The use of an efficient large-scale waterlogging
sensing and information system can provide valuable real-time disaster
information to facilitate disaster management and enhance awareness of the
general public to alleviate losses during and after flood disasters. Therefore,
in this study, a visual sensing approach driven by deep neural networks and
information and communication technology was developed to provide an end-to-end
mechanism to realize waterlogging sensing and event-location mapping. The use
of a deep sensing system in the monsoon season in Taiwan was demonstrated, and
waterlogging events were predicted on the island-wide scale. The system could
sense approximately 2379 vision sources through an internet of video things
framework and transmit the event-location information in 5 min. The proposed
approach can sense waterlogging events at a national scale and provide an
efficient and highly scalable alternative to conventional waterlogging sensing

manual features, i.e., hand gestures, and fine-grained non-manual features
(NMFs), i.e., facial expression, mouth shapes, etc. Although manual features
are dominant, non-manual features also play an important role in the expression
of a sign word. Specifically, many sign words convey different meanings due to
non-manual features, even though they share the same hand gestures. This
ambiguity introduces great challenges in the recognition of sign words. To
tackle the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective architecture called
Global-local Enhancement Network (GLE-Net), including two mutually promoted
streams towards different crucial aspects of SLR. Of the two streams, one
captures the global contextual relationship, while the other stream captures
the discriminative fine-grained cues. Moreover, due to the lack of datasets
explicitly focusing on this kind of features, we introduce the first
non-manual-features-aware isolated Chinese sign language dataset~(NMFs-CSL)
with a total vocabulary size of 1,067 sign words in daily life. Extensive
experiments on NMFs-CSL and SLR500 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of

accuracy on natural data. In this paper, we reduce natural accuracy
degradation. We use the model logits from one clean model to guide learning of
another one robust model, taking into consideration that logits from the well
trained clean model embed the most discriminative features of natural data,
{\it e.g.}, generalizable classifier boundary. Our solution is to constrain
logits from the robust model that takes adversarial examples as input and makes
it similar to those from the clean model fed with corresponding natural data.
It lets the robust model inherit the classifier boundary of the clean model.
Moreover, we observe such boundary guidance can not only preserve high natural
accuracy but also benefit model robustness, which gives new insights and
facilitates progress for the adversarial community. Finally, extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet testify to the
effectiveness of our method. We achieve new state-of-the-art robustness on

Normalization) generally and simplistically assume that training and test data
follow the same distribution. As distribution shifts are inevitable in
real-world applications, well-trained models with previous normalization
methods can perform badly in new environments. Can we develop new normalization
methods to improve generalization robustness under distribution shifts? In this
paper, we answer the question by proposing CrossNorm and SelfNorm. CrossNorm
exchanges channel-wise mean and variance between feature maps to enlarge
training distribution, while SelfNorm uses attention to recalibrate the
statistics to bridge gaps between training and test distributions. CrossNorm
and SelfNorm can complement each other, though exploring different directions
in statistics usage. Extensive experiments on different fields (vision and
language), tasks (classification and segmentation), settings (supervised and
semi-supervised), and distribution shift types (synthetic and natural) show the
effectiveness. Code is available at

                                        <span>Human imitation has become topical recently, driven by GAN&#x27;s ability to
disentangle human pose and body content. However, the latest methods hardly
focus on 3D information, and to avoid self-occlusion, a massive amount of input
images are needed. In this paper, we propose RIN, a novel volume-based
framework for reconstructing a textured 3D model from a single picture and
imitating a subject with the generated model. Specifically, to estimate most of
the human texture, we propose a U-Net-like front-to-back translation network.
With both front and back images input, the textured volume recovery module
allows us to color a volumetric human. A sequence of 3D poses then guides the
colored volume via Flowable Disentangle Networks as a volume-to-volume
translation task. To project volumes to a 2D plane during training, we design a
differentiable depth-aware renderer. Our experiments demonstrate that our
volume-based model is adequate for human imitation, and the back view can be
estimated reliably using our network. While prior works based on either 2D pose
or semantic map often fail for the unstable appearance of a human, our
framework can still produce concrete results, which are competitive to those
imagined from multi-view input.</span>

                                        <span>Optical satellite sensors cannot see the Earth&#x27;s surface through clouds.
Despite the periodic revisit cycle, image sequences acquired by Earth
observation satellites are therefore irregularly sampled in time.
State-of-the-art methods for crop classification (and other time series
analysis tasks) rely on techniques that implicitly assume regular temporal
spacing between observations, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We
propose to use neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in combination
with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The
resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a
recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model&#x27;s hidden state; and a
prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next
observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous
representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the
conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that
govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it
possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time, such that one
can integrate observations whenever they are available, and extrapolate beyond
the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN indeed improves
classification accuracy over common baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and temporal
convolution. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where
only few observations are available (i.e., frequent cloud cover). Moreover, we
show that the ability to extrapolate translates to better classification
performance early in the season, which is important for forecasting.</span>

spectral information, but it sacrifices its spatial resolution in the process.
Many machine-learning-based HSI super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been
proposed recently. However, one of the fundamental limitations of these
approaches is that they are highly dependent on image and camera settings and
can only learn to map an input HSI with one specific setting to an output HSI
with another. However, different cameras capture images with different spectral
response functions and bands numbers due to the diversity of HSI cameras.
Consequently, the existing machine-learning-based approaches fail to learn to
super-resolve HSIs for a wide variety of input-output band settings. We propose
a single Meta-Learning-Based Super-Resolution (MLSR) model, which can take in
HSI images at an arbitrary number of input bands&#x27; peak wavelengths and generate
SR HSIs with an arbitrary number of output bands&#x27; peak wavelengths. We leverage
NTIRE2020 and ICVL datasets to train and validate the performance of the MLSR
model. The results show that the single proposed model can successfully
generate super-resolved HSI bands at arbitrary input-output band settings. The
results are better or at least comparable to baselines that are separately
trained on a specific input-output band setting.</span>

impressive performance in constrained scenarios, they are vulnerable to samples
created by unseen manipulation methods. Some recent works show improvements in
generalisation but rely on cues that are easily corrupted by common
post-processing operations such as compression. In this paper, we propose
LipForensics, a detection approach capable of both generalising to novel
manipulations and withstanding various distortions. LipForensics targets
high-level semantic irregularities in mouth movements, which are common in many
generated videos. It consists in first pretraining a spatio-temporal network to
perform visual speech recognition (lipreading), thus learning rich internal
representations related to natural mouth motion. A temporal network is
subsequently finetuned on fixed mouth embeddings of real and forged data in
order to detect fake videos based on mouth movements without overfitting to
low-level, manipulation-specific artefacts. Extensive experiments show that
this simple approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of
generalisation to unseen manipulations and robustness to perturbations, as well
as shed light on the factors responsible for its performance. Code is available

(or moment) semantically relevant to a language query. The solution to this
challenging task demands understanding videos&#x27; and queries&#x27; semantic content
and the fine-grained reasoning about their multi-modal interactions. Our key
idea is to recast this challenge into an algorithmic graph matching problem.
Fueled by recent advances in Graph Neural Networks, we propose to leverage
Graph Convolutional Networks to model video and textual information as well as
their semantic alignment. To enable the mutual exchange of information across
the modalities, we design a novel Video-Language Graph Matching Network
(VLG-Net) to match video and query graphs. Core ingredients include
representation graphs built atop video snippets and query tokens separately and
used to model intra-modality relationships. A Graph Matching layer is adopted
for cross-modal context modeling and multi-modal fusion. Finally, moment
candidates are created using masked moment attention pooling by fusing the
moment&#x27;s enriched snippet features. We demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art grounding methods on three widely used datasets for temporal
localization of moments in videos with language queries: ActivityNet-Captions,
TACoS, and DiDeMo.</span>

leveraging auxiliary information, such as attribute embedding. Despite the
encouraging results achieved, prior ZSL approaches focus on improving the
discriminant power of seen-class features, yet have largely overlooked the
geometric structure of the samples and the prototypes. The subsequent
attribute-based generative adversarial network (GAN), as a result, also
neglects the topological information in sample generation and further yields
inferior performances in classifying the visual features of unseen classes. In
this paper, we introduce a novel structure-aware feature generation scheme,
termed as SA-GAN, to explicitly account for the topological structure in
learning both the latent space and the generative networks. Specifically, we
introduce a constraint loss to preserve the initial geometric structure when
learning a discriminative latent space, and carry out our GAN training with
additional supervising signals from a structure-aware discriminator and a
reconstruction module. The former supervision distinguishes fake and real
samples based on their affinity to class prototypes, while the latter aims to
reconstruct the original feature space from the generated latent space. This
topology-preserving mechanism enables our method to significantly enhance the
generalization capability on unseen-classes and consequently improve the
classification performance. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art. Our code can

                                        <span>Object detection in optical remote sensing images is an important and
challenging task. In recent years, the methods based on convolutional neural
networks have made good progress. However, due to the large variation in object
scale, aspect ratio, and arbitrary orientation, the detection performance is
difficult to be further improved. In this paper, we discuss the role of
discriminative features in object detection, and then propose a Critical
Feature Capturing Network (CFC-Net) to improve detection accuracy from three
aspects: building powerful feature representation, refining preset anchors, and
optimizing label assignment. Specifically, we first decouple the classification
and regression features, and then construct robust critical features adapted to
the respective tasks through the Polarization Attention Module (PAM). With the
extracted discriminative regression features, the Rotation Anchor Refinement
Module (R-ARM) performs localization refinement on preset horizontal anchors to
obtain superior rotation anchors. Next, the Dynamic Anchor Learning (DAL)
strategy is given to adaptively select high-quality anchors based on their
ability to capture critical features. The proposed framework creates more
powerful semantic representations for objects in remote sensing images and
achieves high-performance real-time object detection. Experimental results on
three remote sensing datasets including HRSC2016, DOTA, and UCAS-AOD show that
our method achieves superior detection performance compared with many
state-of-the-art approaches. Code and models are available at

deep models for vision tasks such as classification. However, recent work has

                                        <span>With the tremendous advances in the architecture and scale of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) over the past few decades, they can easily reach or even
exceed the performance of humans in certain tasks. However, a recently
discovered shortcoming of CNNs is that they are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Although the adversarial robustness of CNNs can be improved by
adversarial training, there is a trade-off between standard accuracy and
adversarial robustness. From the neural architecture perspective, this paper
aims to improve the adversarial robustness of the backbone CNNs that have a
satisfactory accuracy. Under a minimal computational overhead, the introduction
of a dilation architecture is expected to be friendly with the standard
performance of the backbone CNN while pursuing adversarial robustness.
Theoretical analyses on the standard and adversarial error bounds naturally
motivate the proposed neural architecture dilation algorithm. Experimental
results on real-world datasets and benchmark neural networks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to balance the accuracy and adversarial
robustness.</span>

                                        <span>Purpose: We propose a deep learning-based computer-aided detection (CADe)
method to detect breast lesions in ultrafast DCE-MRI sequences. This method
uses both the three-dimensional spatial information and temporal information
obtained from the early-phase of the dynamic acquisition. Methods: The proposed
CADe method, based on a modified 3D RetinaNet model, operates on ultrafast T1
weighted sequences, which are preprocessed for motion compensation, temporal
normalization, and are cropped before passing into the model. The model is
optimized to enable the detection of relatively small breast lesions in a
screening setting, focusing on detection of lesions that are harder to
differentiate from confounding structures inside the breast. Results: The
method was developed based on a dataset consisting of 489 ultrafast MRI studies
obtained from 462 patients containing a total of 572 lesions (365 malignant,
207 benign) and achieved a detection rate, sensitivity, and detection rate of
benign lesions of 0.90 (0.876-0.934), 0.95 (0.934-0.980), and 0.81
(0.751-0.871) at 4 false positives per normal breast with 10-fold
cross-testing, respectively. Conclusions: The deep learning architecture used
for the proposed CADe application can efficiently detect benign and malignant
lesions on ultrafast DCE-MRI. Furthermore, utilizing the less visible hard-to
detect-lesions in training improves the learning process and, subsequently,
detection of malignant breast lesions.</span>

                                        <span>This paper focuses on a new problem of estimating human pose and shape from
single polarization images. Polarization camera is known to be able to capture
the polarization of reflected lights that preserves rich geometric cues of an
object surface. Inspired by the recent applications in surface normal
reconstruction from polarization images, in this paper, we attempt to estimate
human pose and shape from single polarization images by leveraging the
polarization-induced geometric cues. A dedicated two-stage pipeline is
proposed: given a single polarization image, stage one (Polar2Normal) focuses
on the fine detailed human body surface normal estimation; stage two
(Polar2Shape) then reconstructs clothed human shape from the polarization image
and the estimated surface normal. To empirically validate our approach, a
dedicated dataset (PHSPD) is constructed, consisting of over 500K frames with
accurate pose and shape annotations. Empirical evaluations on this real-world
dataset as well as a synthetic dataset, SURREAL, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. It suggests polarization camera as a promising alternative to
the more conventional RGB camera for human pose and shape estimation.</span>

                                        <span>Imaging depth and spectrum have been extensively studied in isolation from
each other for decades. Recently, hyperspectral-depth (HS-D) imaging emerges to
capture both information simultaneously by combining two different imaging
systems; one for depth, the other for spectrum. While being accurate, this
combinational approach induces increased form factor, cost, capture time, and
alignment/registration problems. In this work, departing from the combinational
principle, we propose a compact single-shot monocular HS-D imaging method. Our
method uses a diffractive optical element (DOE), the point spread function of
which changes with respect to both depth and spectrum. This enables us to
reconstruct spectrum and depth from a single captured image. To this end, we
develop a differentiable simulator and a neural-network-based reconstruction
that are jointly optimized via automatic differentiation. To facilitate
learning the DOE, we present a first HS-D dataset by building a benchtop HS-D
imager that acquires high-quality ground truth. We evaluate our method with
synthetic and real experiments by building an experimental prototype and
achieve state-of-the-art HS-D imaging results.</span>

                                        <span>State-of-the-art methods in image-to-image translation are capable of
learning a mapping from a source domain to a target domain with unpaired image
data. Though the existing methods have achieved promising results, they still
produce visual artifacts, being able to translate low-level information but not
high-level semantics of input images. One possible reason is that generators do
not have the ability to perceive the most discriminative parts between the
source and target domains, thus making the generated images low quality. In
this paper, we propose a new Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks
(AttentionGAN) for the unpaired image-to-image translation task. AttentionGAN
can identify the most discriminative foreground objects and minimize the change
of the background. The attention-guided generators in AttentionGAN are able to
produce attention masks, and then fuse the generation output with the attention
masks to obtain high-quality target images. Accordingly, we also design a novel
attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several generative tasks with eight public
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is effective to generate
sharper and more realistic images compared with existing competitive models.

                                        <span>We propose ResRep, a novel method for lossless channel pruning (a.k.a. filter
pruning), which slims down a CNN by reducing the width (number of output
channels) of convolutional layers. Inspired by the neurobiology research about
the independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a
CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to
maintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with
regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the
latter, we realize structured sparsity. Then we equivalently merge the
remembering and forgetting parts into the original architecture with narrower
layers. In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of
Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from
the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on
parameters to produce sparsity, which may suppress the parameters essential for
the remembering. ResRep slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on
ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop, which is
the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio. The

                                        <span>The work presented in this paper is to propose a reliable high-quality system
of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation with a low
computation requirement. The system consists of a CNN for the main processing
for the segmentation, a pre-CNN block for data reduction and post-CNN
refinement block. The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving
only 108 kernels and 20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed,
following the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application specific CNN), to perform
mono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization and
pixel classification. Each layer fits the task assigned to it, by means of (i)
appropriate normalization applied to its input data, (ii) correct convolution
modes for the assigned task, and (iii) suitable nonlinear transformation to
optimize the convolution results. In this specific design context, the number
of kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task,
instead of exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information
density and to reduce randomness in the processing. The proposed activation
function Full-ReLU helps to halve the number of kernels in convolution layers
of high-pass filtering without degrading processing quality. A large number of
experiments with BRATS2018 dataset have been conducted to measure the
processing quality and reproducibility of the proposed system. The results
demonstrate that the system reproduces reliably almost the same output to the
same input after retraining. The mean dice scores for enhancing tumor, whole
tumor and tumor core are 77.2%, 89.2% and 76.3%, respectively. The simple
structure and reliable high processing quality of the proposed system will
facilitate its implementation and medical applications.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays deep learning-based methods have achieved a remarkable progress at
the image classification task among a wide range of commonly used datasets
(ImageNet, CIFAR, SVHN, Caltech 101, SUN397, etc.). SOTA performance on each of
the mentioned datasets is obtained by careful tuning of the model architecture
and training tricks according to the properties of the target data. Although
this approach allows setting academic records, it is unrealistic that an
average data scientist would have enough resources to build a sophisticated
training pipeline for every image classification task he meets in practice.
This work is focusing on reviewing the latest augmentation and regularization
methods for the image classification and exploring ways to automatically choose
some of the most important hyperparameters: total number of epochs, initial
learning rate value and it&#x27;s schedule. Having a training procedure equipped
with a lightweight modern CNN architecture (like bileNetV3 or EfficientNet),
sufficient level of regularization and adaptive to data learning rate schedule,
we can achieve a reasonable performance on a variety of downstream image
classification tasks without manual tuning of parameters to each particular
task. Resulting models are computationally efficient and can be deployed to CPU
using the OpenVINO toolkit. Source code is available as a part of the OpenVINO

arbitrary numbers and positions of viewpoints. It is a challenging and
realistic setting for view-based 3D shape recognition. We propose a canonical
view representation to tackle this challenge. We first transform the original
features of arbitrary views to a fixed number of view features, dubbed
canonical view representation, by aligning the arbitrary view features to a set
of learnable reference view features using optimal transport. In this way, each
3D shape with arbitrary views is represented by a fixed number of canonical
view features, which are further aggregated to generate a rich and robust 3D
shape representation for shape recognition. We also propose a canonical view
feature separation constraint to enforce that the view features in canonical
view representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space.
Experiments on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and RGBD datasets show that our
method achieves competitive results under the fixed viewpoint settings, and
significantly outperforms the applicable methods under the arbitrary view
setting.</span>

                                        <span>Typical adversarial-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation methods are
vulnerable when the source and target datasets are highly-complex or exhibit a
large discrepancy between their data distributions. Recently, several
Lipschitz-constraint-based methods have been explored. The satisfaction of
Lipschitz continuity guarantees a remarkable performance on a target domain.
However, they lack a mathematical analysis of why a Lipschitz constraint is
beneficial to unsupervised domain adaptation and usually perform poorly on
large-scale datasets. In this paper, we take the principle of utilizing a
Lipschitz constraint further by discussing how it affects the error bound of
unsupervised domain adaptation. A connection between them is built and an
illustration of how Lipschitzness reduces the error bound is presented. A
\textbf{local smooth discrepancy} is defined to measure Lipschitzness of a
target distribution in a pointwise way. When constructing a deep end-to-end
model, to ensure the effectiveness and stability of unsupervised domain
adaptation, three critical factors are considered in our proposed optimization
strategy, i.e., the sample amount of a target domain, dimension and batchsize
of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on
several standard benchmarks. Our ablation study shows that the sample amount of
a target domain, the dimension and batchsize of samples indeed greatly impact
Lipschitz-constraint-based methods&#x27; ability to handle large-scale datasets.

widely considered to be related to adversarial robustness, we theoretically
characterize the $\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm of 2D multi-channel
convolutional layers and provide efficient methods to compute the exact
$\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm. Based on our theorem, we propose a novel
regularization method termed norm decay, which can effectively reduce the norms
of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. Experiments show that
norm-regularization methods, including norm decay, weight decay, and singular
value clipping, can improve generalization of CNNs. However, they can slightly
hurt adversarial robustness. Observing this unexpected phenomenon, we compute
the norms of layers in the CNNs trained with three different adversarial
training frameworks and surprisingly find that adversarially robust CNNs have
comparable or even larger layer norms than their non-adversarially robust
counterparts. Furthermore, we prove that under a mild assumption, adversarially
robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially
robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant. For
this reason, enforcing small norms on CNN layers may be neither necessary nor
effective in achieving adversarial robustness. The code is available at

learning to colorize black-and-white images. Consequently, the generated color
is easier to be overflowed, and the semantic faults are invisible. As a human
experience in colorization, our brains first detect and recognize the objects
in the photo, then imagine their plausible colors based on many similar objects
we have seen in real life, and finally colorize them, as described in the
teaser. In this study, we simulate that human-like action to let our network
first learn to understand the photo, then colorize it. Thus, our work can
provide plausible colors at a semantic level. Plus, the semantic information of
the learned model becomes understandable and able to interact. Additionally, we
also prove that Instance Normalization is also a missing ingredient for
colorization, then re-design the inference flow of U-Net to have two streams of
data, providing an appropriate way of normalizing the feature maps from the
black-and-white image and its semantic map. As a result, our network can
provide plausible colors competitive to the typical colorization works for
specific objects.</span>

interpret geometric data, particularly for human subjects. In this paper we
propose an elegant fusion of regression (bottom-up) and generative (top-down)
methods to fit a parametric template model to raw scan meshes.

Our first major contribution is an intrinsic convolutional mesh U-net
architecture that predicts pointwise correspondence to a template surface.
Soft-correspondence is formulated as coordinates in a newly-constructed
Cartesian space. Modeling correspondence as Euclidean proximity enables
efficient optimization, both for network training and for the next step of the
algorithm.

Our second contribution is a generative optimization algorithm that uses the
U-net correspondence predictions to guide a parametric Iterative Closest Point
registration. By employing pre-trained human surface parametric models we
maximally leverage domain-specific prior knowledge.

The pairing of a mesh-convolutional network with generative model fitting
enables us to predict correspondence for real human surface scans including
occlusions, partialities, and varying genus (e.g. from self-contact). We
evaluate the proposed method on the FAUST correspondence challenge where we
achieve 20% (33%) improvement over state of the art methods for inter- (intra-)
subject correspondence.</span>

achieved unprecedented performance in various computer vision tasks, but the
rationale for the computations and structures of successful neural networks is
not fully understood. Theories abound for the aptitude of convolutional neural
networks for image classification, but less is understood about why such models
would be capable of complex visual tasks such as inference and anomaly
identification. Here, we propose a sparse coding interpretation of neural
networks that have ReLU activation and of convolutional neural networks in
particular. In sparse coding, when the model&#x27;s basis functions are assumed to
be orthogonal, the optimal coefficients are given by the soft-threshold
function of the basis functions projected onto the input image. In a
non-negative variant of sparse coding, the soft-threshold function becomes a
ReLU. Here, we derive these solutions via sparse coding with orthogonal-assumed
basis functions, then we derive the convolutional neural network forward
transformation from a modified non-negative orthogonal sparse coding model with
an exponential prior parameter for each sparse coding coefficient. Next, we
derive a complete convolutional neural network without normalization and
pooling by adding logistic regression to a hierarchical sparse coding model.
Finally we motivate potentially more robust forward transformations by
maintaining sparse priors in convolutional neural networks as well performing a
stronger nonlinear transformation.</span>

                                        <span>Although current face manipulation techniques achieve impressive performance
regarding quality and controllability, they are struggling to generate temporal
coherent face videos. In this work, we explore to take full advantage of the
temporal coherence for video face forgery detection. To achieve this, we
propose a novel end-to-end framework, which consists of two major stages. The
first stage is a fully temporal convolution network (FTCN). The key insight of
FTCN is to reduce the spatial convolution kernel size to 1, while maintaining
the temporal convolution kernel size unchanged. We surprisingly find this
special design can benefit the model for extracting the temporal features as
well as improve the generalization capability. The second stage is a Temporal
Transformer network, which aims to explore the long-term temporal coherence.
The proposed framework is general and flexible, which can be directly trained
from scratch without any pre-training models or external datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework outperforms existing methods and remains
effective when applied to detect new sorts of face forgery videos.</span>

                                        <span>Object proposals have become an integral preprocessing steps of many vision
pipelines including object detection, weakly supervised detection, object
discovery, tracking, etc. Compared to the learning-free methods, learning-based
proposals have become popular recently due to the growing interest in object
detection. The common paradigm is to learn object proposals from data labeled
with a set of object regions and their corresponding categories. However, this
approach often struggles with novel objects in the open world that are absent
in the training set. In this paper, we identify that the problem is that the
binary classifiers in existing proposal methods tend to overfit to the training
categories. Therefore, we propose a classification-free Object Localization
Network (OLN) which estimates the objectness of each region purely by how well
the location and shape of a region overlap with any ground-truth object (e.g.,
centerness and IoU). This simple strategy learns generalizable objectness and
outperforms existing proposals on cross-category generalization on COCO, as
well as cross-dataset evaluation on RoboNet, Object365, and EpicKitchens.
Finally, we demonstrate the merit of OLN for long-tail object detection on
large vocabulary dataset, LVIS, where we notice clear improvement in rare and
common categories.</span>

                                        <span>As a challenging task of high-level video understanding, weakly supervised
temporal action localization has been attracting increasing attention. With
only video annotations, most existing methods seek to handle this task with a
localization-by-classification framework, which generally adopts a selector to
select snippets of high probabilities of actions or namely the foreground.
Nevertheless, the existing foreground selection strategies have a major
limitation of only considering the unilateral relation from foreground to
actions, which cannot guarantee the foreground-action consistency. In this
paper, we present a framework named FAC-Net based on the I3D backbone, on which
three branches are appended, named class-wise foreground classification branch,
class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance learning branch. First,
our class-wise foreground classification branch regularizes the relation
between actions and foreground to maximize the foreground-background
separation. Besides, the class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance
learning branch are adopted to regularize the foreground-action consistency and
help to learn a meaningful foreground classifier. Within each branch, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism, which calculates multiple attention
scores for each snippet, to focus on both discriminative and
less-discriminative snippets to capture the full action boundaries.
Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Biology is both an important application area and a source of motivation for
development of advanced machine learning techniques. Although much attention
has been paid to large and complex data sets resulting from high-throughput
sequencing, advances in high-quality video recording technology have begun to
generate similarly rich data sets requiring sophisticated techniques from both
computer vision and time-series analysis. Moreover, just as studying gene
expression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to
other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally
tractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general
principles about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one
such example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory
colonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially
induced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the
conclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains
unclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the
process. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of
One-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant
colonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal
conditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector
Data Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN)
that synthesizes fake &quot;inner outlier&quot; observations during training that are
near the center of the DSVDD data description. We show that IO-GEN increases
the reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines.
This method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human
observation is needed.</span>

allowing to increase the resolution of an image.The need for high-resolution
digital images exists in diverse domains, for example the medical and spatial
domains. The obtaining of high-resolution digital images can be made at the
time of the shooting, but it is often synonymic of important costs because of
the necessary material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of
super-resolution reconstruction, consisting from one or several low resolution
images to obtain a high-resolution image. The american patent US 9208537
describes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and
categorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the
borders of the zone. The category of it zone determines the type of
interpolation used to add pixels in aforementioned zone, to increase the
neatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a low-resolution
image there high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution
reconstruction whose learning is based on networks of neurons and on image or a
picture library. The demand of chinese patent CN 107563965 and the scientist
publication &quot;Pixel Recursive Super Resolution&quot;, R. Dahl, M. Norouzi, J. Shlens
propose such methods. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that it is
possible to reconstruct coherent human faces from very degraded pixelated
images with a very fast algorithm, more faster than compressed sensing (CS),
easier to compute and without deep learning, so without important technology
resources, i.e. a large database of thousands training images (see
arXiv:2003.13063).

architecture search. Previous two-stage one-shot approaches are limited by
search space with a fixed depth. It seems handy to include an additional skip
connection in the search space to make depths variable. However, it creates a
large range of perturbation during supernet training and it has difficulty
giving a confident ranking for subnetworks. In this paper, we discover that
skip connections bring about significant feature inconsistency compared with
other operations, which potentially degrades the supernet performance. Based on
this observation, we tackle the problem by imposing an equivariant learnable
stabilizer to homogenize such disparities. Experiments show that our proposed
stabilizer helps to improve the supernet&#x27;s convergence as well as ranking
performance. With an evolutionary search backend that incorporates the
stabilized supernet as an evaluator, we derive a family of state-of-the-art
architectures, the SCARLET series of several depths, especially SCARLET-A
obtains 76.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code is available at

This work introduces a method to count vehicles from traffic videos that

space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in
which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is
confronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is
inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot
explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may
be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the
aforementioned problems, we propose a \textbf{Deep Self-Adaptive
Hashing~(DSAH)} model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two
special designs: \textbf{Adaptive Neighbor Discovery~(AND)} and
\textbf{Pairwise Information Content~(PIC)}. Firstly, we adopt the AND to
initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix, and then refine
this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further
investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly,
we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to
them, which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain
more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies
facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance in a
self-adaptive manner.</span>

                                        <span>Although federated learning improves privacy of training data by exchanging
local gradients or parameters rather than raw data, the adversary still can
leverage local gradients and parameters to obtain local training data by
launching reconstruction and membership inference attacks. To defend such
privacy attacks, many noises perturbation methods (like differential privacy or
CountSketch matrix) have been widely designed. However, the strong defence
ability and high learning accuracy of these schemes cannot be ensured at the
same time, which will impede the wide application of FL in practice (especially
for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and
strong privacy guarantee). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose
\emph{an efficient model perturbation method for federated learning} to defend
reconstruction and membership inference attacks launched by curious clients. On
the one hand, similar to the differential privacy, our method also selects
random numbers as perturbed noises added to the global model parameters, and
thus it is very efficient and easy to be integrated in practice. Meanwhile, the
random selected noises are positive real numbers and the corresponding value
can be arbitrarily large, and thus the strong defence ability can be ensured.
On the other hand, unlike differential privacy or other perturbation methods
that cannot eliminate the added noises, our method allows the server to recover
the true gradients by eliminating the added noises. Therefore, our method does
not hinder learning accuracy at all.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic 3D neuron reconstruction is critical for analysing the morphology
and functionality of neurons in brain circuit activities. However, the
performance of existing tracing algorithms is hinged by the low image quality.
Recently, a series of deep learning based segmentation methods have been
proposed to improve the quality of raw 3D optical image stacks by removing
noises and restoring neuronal structures from low-contrast background. Due to
the variety of neuron morphology and the lack of large neuron datasets, most of
current neuron segmentation models rely on introducing complex and
specially-designed submodules to a base architecture with the aim of encoding
better feature representations. Though successful, extra burden would be put on
computation during inference. Therefore, rather than modifying the base
network, we shift our focus to the dataset itself. The encoder-decoder backbone
used in most neuron segmentation models attends only intra-volume voxel points
to learn structural features of neurons but neglect the shared intrinsic
semantic features of voxels belonging to the same category among different
volumes, which is also important for expressive representation learning. Hence,
to better utilise the scarce dataset, we propose to explicitly exploit such
intrinsic features of voxels through a novel voxel-level cross-volume
representation learning paradigm on the basis of an encoder-decoder
segmentation model. Our method introduces no extra cost during inference.
Evaluated on 42 3D neuron images from BigNeuron project, our proposed method is
demonstrated to improve the learning ability of the original segmentation model
and further enhancing the reconstruction performance.</span>

body part, neglecting the fact that the essential nuance of human motion is
conveyed through a concert of subtle movements of face, hands, and body. In
this paper, we present FrankMocap, a fast and accurate whole-body 3D pose
estimation system that can produce 3D face, hands, and body simultaneously from
in-the-wild monocular images. The core idea of FrankMocap is its modular
design: We first run 3D pose regression methods for face, hands, and body
independently, followed by composing the regression outputs via an integration
module. The separate regression modules allow us to take full advantage of
their state-of-the-art performances without compromising the original accuracy
and reliability in practice. We develop three different integration modules
that trade off between latency and accuracy. All of them are capable of
providing simple yet effective solutions to unify the separate outputs into
seamless whole-body pose estimation results. We quantitatively and
qualitatively demonstrate that our modularized system outperforms both the
optimization-based and end-to-end methods of estimating whole-body pose.</span>

                                        <span>One of the key limitations in machine learning models is poor performance on
data that is out of the domain of the training distribution. This is especially
true for image analysis in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as variations in
hardware and software create non-standard intensities, contrasts, and noise
distributions across scanners. Recently, image translation models have been
proposed to augment data across domains to create synthetic data points. In
this paper, we investigate the application an unsupervised image translation
model to augment MR images from a source dataset to a target dataset.
Specifically, we want to evaluate how well these models can create synthetic
data points representative of the target dataset through image translation, and
to see if a segmentation model trained these synthetic data points would
approach the performance of a model trained directly on the target dataset. We
consider three configurations of augmentation between datasets consisting of
translation between images, between scanner vendors, and from labels to images.
It was found that the segmentation models trained on synthetic data from labels
to images configuration yielded the closest performance to the segmentation
model trained directly on the target dataset. The Dice coeffcient score per
each target vendor (GE, Siemens, Philips) for training on synthetic data was
0.63, 0.64, and 0.58, compared to training directly on target dataset was 0.65,
0.72, and 0.61.</span>

                                        <span>Generating conversational gestures from speech audio is challenging due to
the inherent one-to-many mapping between audio and body motions. Conventional
CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of
all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during
inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional
variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many
audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared
code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong
correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion
beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information
independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts
poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating
random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss,
bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE.
Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates
more realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods,
quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can
be readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips
on the timeline. Code and more results are at

improving the model performance. Moreover, we design a 2.5D light-weight

knowledge imparted by teachers, a multi-granularity distillation mechanism is
proposed for transferring more understandable knowledge for student networks. A
multi-granularity self-analyzing module of the teacher network is designed,
which enables the student network to learn knowledge from different teaching
patterns. Furthermore, a stable excitation scheme is proposed for robust
supervision for the student training. The proposed distillation mechanism can
be embedded into different distillation frameworks, which are taken as
baselines. Experiments show the mechanism improves the accuracy by 0.58% on
average and by 1.08% in the best over the baselines, which makes its
performance superior to the state-of-the-arts. It is also exploited that the
student&#x27;s ability of fine-tuning and robustness to noisy inputs can be improved

                                        <span>In industry, there exist plenty of scenarios where old gray photos need to be
automatically colored, such as video sites and archives. In this paper, we
present the HistoryNet focusing on historical person&#x27;s diverse high fidelity
clothing colorization based on fine grained semantic understanding and prior.
Colorization of historical persons is realistic and practical, however,
existing methods do not perform well in the regards. In this paper, a
HistoryNet including three parts, namely, classification, fine grained semantic
parsing and colorization, is proposed. Classification sub-module supplies
classifying of images according to the eras, nationalities and garment types;
Parsing sub-network supplies the semantic for person contours, clothing and
background in the image to achieve more accurate colorization of clothes and
persons and prevent color overflow. In the training process, we integrate
classification and semantic parsing features into the coloring generation
network to improve colorization. Through the design of classification and
parsing subnetwork, the accuracy of image colorization can be improved and the
boundary of each part of image can be more clearly. Moreover, we also propose a
novel Modern Historical Movies Dataset (MHMD) containing 1,353,166 images and
42 labels of eras, nationalities, and garment types for automatic colorization
from 147 historical movies or TV series made in modern time. Various
quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art colorization methods, especially on military
uniforms, which has correct colors according to the historical literatures.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised representation learning has achieved outstanding performances
using centralized data available on the Internet. However, the increasing
awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image
data that grows explosively in multiple parties (e.g., mobile phones and
cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn
visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To
address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning
framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled
data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a
target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates
clients&#x27; models with the aggregated model. It preserves data privacy as each
party only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple
parties are normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID),
leading to performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose two
simple but effective methods: 1) We design the communication protocol to upload
only the encoders of online networks for server aggregation and update them
with the aggregated encoder; 2) We introduce a new module to dynamically decide
how to update predictors based on the divergence caused by non-IID. The
predictor is the other component of the online network. Extensive experiments
and ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FedU. It
outperforms training with only one party by over 5% and other methods by over
14% in linear and semi-supervised evaluation on non-IID data.</span>

                                        <span>We present PICCOLO, a simple and efficient algorithm for omnidirectional
localization. Given a colored point cloud and a 360 panorama image of a scene,
our objective is to recover the camera pose at which the panorama image is
taken. Our pipeline works in an off-the-shelf manner with a single image given
as a query and does not require any training of neural networks or collecting
ground-truth poses of images. Instead, we match each point cloud color to the
holistic view of the panorama image with gradient-descent optimization to find
the camera pose. Our loss function, called sampling loss, is point
cloud-centric, evaluated at the projected location of every point in the point
cloud. In contrast, conventional photometric loss is image-centric, comparing
colors at each pixel location. With a simple change in the compared entities,
sampling loss effectively overcomes the severe visual distortion of
omnidirectional images, and enjoys the global context of the 360 view to handle
challenging scenarios for visual localization. PICCOLO outperforms existing
omnidirectional localization algorithms in both accuracy and stability when
evaluated in various environments.</span>

descriptions, which requires the model to fully understand video scenes
including objects and their interactions. Prevailing methods adopt
off-the-shelf object detection networks to give object proposals and use the
attention mechanism to model the relations between objects. They often miss
some undefined semantic concepts of the pretrained model and fail to identify
exact predicate relationships between objects. In this paper, we investigate an
open research task of generating text descriptions for the given videos, and
propose Cross-Modal Graph (CMG) with meta concepts for video captioning.
Specifically, to cover the useful semantic concepts in video captions, we
weakly learn the corresponding visual regions for text descriptions, where the
associated visual regions and textual words are named cross-modal meta
concepts. We further build meta concept graphs dynamically with the learned
cross-modal meta concepts. We also construct holistic video-level and local
frame-level video graphs with the predicted predicates to model video sequence
structures. We validate the efficacy of our proposed techniques with extensive
experiments and achieve state-of-the-art results on two public datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging learning problem in
pattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters,
different handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages
and scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades but there is
very limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors,
like, diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts
on handcrafted feature extraction techniques which are language/script specific
and are not always available, and unavailability of public datasets and codes
to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge
success in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides
end-to-end learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In
this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning architecture which exploits
transfer learning and image-augmentation for end-to-end learning for script
independent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net. The network is
based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers
of a pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and
image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training, better performance and
better generalisations. The experimental results on publicly available datasets
of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada,
Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of
HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks. For reproducibility of the
results and for the advancements of the HCR research, complete code is publicly

                                        <span>Most recent transformer-based models show impressive performance on vision
tasks, even better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we
present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for
high-quality instance segmentation. The proposed method, Segmenting Objects
with TRansformers (SOTR), simplifies the segmentation pipeline, building on an
alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting
per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating
segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively
extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context
dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer,
respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed
twin transformer is time- and resource-efficient since only a row and a column
attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be
incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make
considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training
convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS
COCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches.
We hope our simple but strong framework could serve as a preferment baseline
for instance-level recognition. Our code is available at

and requires a high level of understanding of radiologic expertise. Recently,
deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have shown remarkable performance
in interpreting CXR in adults. However, there is a lack of evidence indicating
that D-CNNs can recognize accurately multiple lung pathologies from pediatric
CXR scans. In particular, the development of diagnostic models for the
detection of pediatric chest diseases faces significant challenges such as (i)
lack of physician-annotated datasets and (ii) class imbalance problems. In this
paper, we retrospectively collect a large dataset of 5,017 pediatric CXR scans,
for which each is manually labeled by an experienced radiologist for the
presence of 10 common pathologies. A D-CNN model is then trained on 3,550
annotated scans to classify multiple pediatric lung pathologies automatically.
To address the high-class imbalance issue, we propose to modify and apply
&quot;Distribution-Balanced loss&quot; for training D-CNNs which reshapes the standard
Binary-Cross Entropy loss (BCE) to efficiently learn harder samples by
down-weighting the loss assigned to the majority classes. On an independent
test set of 777 studies, the proposed approach yields an area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.709 (95% CI, 0.690-0.729). The
sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score at the cutoff value are 0.722
(0.694-0.750), 0.579 (0.563-0.595), and 0.389 (0.373-0.405), respectively.
These results significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on
most of the target diseases. Moreover, our ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed loss function compared to other standard losses,
e.g., BCE and Focal Loss, for this learning task. Overall, we demonstrate the
potential of D-CNNs in interpreting pediatric CXRs.</span>

structure of renal compartments from abdominal CTA images and is of great
significance to the diagnosis and treatment for kidney diseases. However, due
to the unclear compartment boundary, thin compartment structure and large
anatomy variation of 3D kidney CT images, deep-learning based renal compartment
segmentation is a challenging task. We propose a novel weakly supervised
learning framework, Cycle Prototype Network, for 3D renal compartment
segmentation. It has three innovations: 1) A Cycle Prototype Learning (CPL) is
proposed to learn consistency for generalization. It learns from pseudo labels
through the forward process and learns consistency regularization through the
reverse process. The two processes make the model robust to noise and
label-efficient. 2) We propose a Bayes Weakly Supervised Module (BWSM) based on
cross-period prior knowledge. It learns prior knowledge from cross-period
unlabeled data and perform error correction automatically, thus generates
accurate pseudo labels. 3) We present a Fine Decoding Feature Extractor (FDFE)
for fine-grained feature extraction. It combines global morphology information
and local detail information to obtain feature maps with sharp detail, so the
model will achieve fine segmentation on thin structures. Our model achieves
Dice of 79.1% and 78.7% with only four labeled images, achieving a significant
improvement by about 20% than typical prototype model PANet.</span>

                                        <span>X-ray imaging in DICOM format is the most commonly used imaging modality in
clinical practice, resulting in vast, non-normalized databases. This leads to
an obstacle in deploying AI solutions for analyzing medical images, which often
requires identifying the right body part before feeding the image into a
specified AI model. This challenge raises the need for an automated and
efficient approach to classifying body parts from X-ray scans. Unfortunately,
to the best of our knowledge, there is no open tool or framework for this task
to date. To fill this lack, we introduce a DICOM Imaging Router that deploys
deep CNNs for categorizing unknown DICOM X-ray images into five anatomical
groups: abdominal, adult chest, pediatric chest, spine, and others. To this
end, a large-scale X-ray dataset consisting of 16,093 images has been collected
and manually classified. We then trained a set of state-of-the-art deep CNNs
using a training set of 11,263 images. These networks were then evaluated on an
independent test set of 2,419 images and showed superior performance in
classifying the body parts. Specifically, our best performing model achieved a
recall of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988), a precision of 0.985 (95% CI,
0.975-0.989) and a F1-score of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.976-0.987), whilst requiring
less computation for inference (0.0295 second per image). Our external validity
on 1,000 X-ray images shows the robustness of the proposed approach across
hospitals. These remarkable performances indicate that deep CNNs can accurately
and effectively differentiate human body parts from X-ray scans, thereby
providing potential benefits for a wide range of applications in clinical
settings. The dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models from this study
will be made publicly available on our project website at https://vindr.ai/.</span>

human-computer interaction systems. Despite recent advancements in FER,
performance often drops significantly for non-frontal facial images. We propose
Contrastive Learning of Multi-view facial Expressions (CL-MEx) to exploit
facial images captured simultaneously from different angles towards FER. CL-MEx
is a two-step training framework. In the first step, an encoder network is
pre-trained with the proposed self-supervised contrastive loss, where it learns
to generate view-invariant embeddings for different views of a subject. The
model is then fine-tuned with labeled data in a supervised setting. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on two multi-view FER
datasets, KDEF and DDCF, where state-of-the-art performances are achieved.
Further experiments show the robustness of our method in dealing with
challenging angles and reduced amounts of labeled data.</span>

Representation (GeoCLR) for efficient training of deep-learning Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The method leverages georeference information by
generating a similar image pair using images taken of nearby locations, and
contrasting these with an image pair that is far apart. The underlying
assumption is that images gathered within a close distance are more likely to
have similar visual appearance, where this can be reasonably satisfied in
seafloor robotic imaging applications where image footprints are limited to
edge lengths of a few metres and are taken so that they overlap along a
vehicle&#x27;s trajectory, whereas seafloor substrates and habitats have patch sizes
that are far larger. A key advantage of this method is that it is
self-supervised and does not require any human input for CNN training. The
method is computationally efficient, where results can be generated between
dives during multi-day AUV missions using computational resources that would be
accessible during most oceanic field trials. We apply GeoCLR to habitat
classification on a dataset that consists of ~86k images gathered using an
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We demonstrate how the latent
representations generated by GeoCLR can be used to efficiently guide human
annotation efforts, where the semi-supervised framework improves classification
accuracy by an average of 11.8 % compared to state-of-the-art transfer learning
using the same CNN and equivalent number of human annotations for training.</span>

non-overlapping camera views. Since person ReID data contains sensitive
personal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging
distributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However,
existing studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to
obtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to
learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID
enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server
aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data
privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and
distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of
cloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign
computation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict
suitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server
aggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID
datasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also
reduces computation cost by 29%. Our FedUReID system with the joint
optimization will shed light on implementing federated learning to more
multimedia tasks without data labels.</span>

depth estimation as a way to produce 3D pointclouds, turning cameras into
pseudo-lidar sensors. These two-stage detectors improve with the accuracy of
the intermediate depth estimation network, which can itself be improved without
manual labels via large-scale self-supervised learning. However, they tend to
suffer from overfitting more than end-to-end methods, are more complex, and the

models such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). While prior work has focused on
generative methods for disentangled representation learning, these approaches
do not scale to large datasets due to current limitations of generative models.
Instead, we explore regularization methods with contrastive learning, which
could result in disentangled representations that are powerful enough for large
scale datasets and downstream applications. However, we find that unsupervised
disentanglement is difficult to achieve due to optimization and initialization
sensitivity, with trade-offs in task performance. We evaluate disentanglement
with downstream tasks, analyze the benefits and disadvantages of each
regularization used, and discuss future directions.</span>

                                        <span>Labeling vertebral discs from MRI scans is important for the proper diagnosis
of spinal related diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, degenerative cervical myelopathy and cancer. Automatic labeling of
the vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity
between discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and
surrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans
(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In
previous studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection
step and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false
positive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by
reformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation
technique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level
attention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their
skeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the
strength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the
missing area and false positive detection. To further improve the performance
of the proposed method, we propose a skeleton-based search space to reduce
false positive detection. The proposed method evaluated on spine generic public
multi-center dataset and demonstrated better performance comparing to previous
work, on both T1w and T2w contrasts. The method is implemented in ivadomed
(https://ivadomed.org).</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we present a self-training method, named ST3D++, with a
holistic pseudo label denoising pipeline for unsupervised domain adaptation on
3D object detection. ST3D++ aims at reducing noise in pseudo label generation
as well as alleviating the negative impacts of noisy pseudo labels on model
training. First, ST3D++ pre-trains the 3D object detector on the labeled source
domain with random object scaling (ROS) which is designed to reduce target
domain pseudo label noise arising from object scale bias of the source domain.
Then, the detector is progressively improved through alternating between
generating pseudo labels and training the object detector with pseudo-labeled
target domain data. Here, we equip the pseudo label generation process with a
hybrid quality-aware triplet memory to improve the quality and stability of
generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, in the model training stage, we propose a
source data assisted training strategy and a curriculum data augmentation
policy to effectively rectify noisy gradient directions and avoid model
over-fitting to noisy pseudo labeled data. These specific designs enable the
detector to be trained on meticulously refined pseudo labeled target data with
denoised training signals, and thus effectively facilitate adapting an object
detector to a target domain without requiring annotations. Finally, our method
is assessed on four 3D benchmark datasets (i.e., Waymo, KITTI, Lyft, and
nuScenes) for three common categories (i.e., car, pedestrian and bicycle).
ST3D++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated settings,
outperforming the corresponding baseline by a large margin (e.g., 9.6% $\sim$
38.16% on Waymo $\rightarrow$ KITTI in terms of AP$_{\text{3D}}$), and even
surpasses the fully supervised oracle results on the KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark with target prior. Code will be available.</span>

the 360-degree sensors, but the vast majority of available semantic
segmentation training images are captured with pinhole cameras. In this work,
we look at this problem through the lens of domain adaptation and bring
panoramic semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data
originates from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images.
First, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic
semantic segmentation, where a network trained on labelled examples from the
source domain of pinhole camera data is deployed in a different target domain
of panoramic images, for which no labels are available. To validate this idea,
we collect and publicly release DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset
for panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to
study the Pinhole-to-Panoramic transfer and accompanied with pinhole camera
training examples obtained from Cityscapes. DensePASS covers both, labelled-
and unlabelled 360-degree images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes
which explicitly fit the categories available in the source domain (i.e.
pinhole) data. To meet the challenge of domain shift, we leverage the current
progress of attention-based mechanisms and build a generic framework for
cross-domain panoramic semantic segmentation based on different variants of
attention-augmented domain adaptation modules. Our framework facilitates
information exchange at local- and global levels when learning the domain
correspondences and improves the domain adaptation performance of two standard
segmentation networks by 6.05% and 11.26% in Mean IoU.</span>

                                        <span>The mainstream image captioning models rely on Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) image features to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, image
scene graphs have been used to augment captioning models so as to leverage
their structural semantics, such as object entities, relationships and
attributes. Several studies have noted that the naive use of scene graphs from
a black-box scene graph generator harms image captioning performance and that
scene graph-based captioning models have to incur the overhead of explicit use
of image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we
propose \textbf{SG2Caps}, a framework that utilizes only the scene graph labels
for competitive image captioning performance. The basic idea is to close the
semantic gap between the two scene graphs - one derived from the input image
and the other from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the
spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an
additional HOI graph. SG2Caps outperforms existing scene graph-only captioning
models by a large margin, indicating scene graphs as a promising representation
for image captioning. Direct utilization of scene graph labels avoids expensive
graph convolutions over high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49% fewer
trainable parameters. Our code is available at:

its impulse response (IR), a representation of how a full-range stimulus sound
excites it. This work generates an IR from a single image, which can then be
applied to other signals using convolution, simulating the reverberant
characteristics of the space shown in the image. Recording these IRs is both
time-intensive and expensive, and often infeasible for inaccessible locations.
We use an end-to-end neural network architecture to generate plausible audio
impulse responses from single images of acoustic environments. We evaluate our
method both by comparisons to ground truth data and by human expert evaluation.
We demonstrate our approach by generating plausible impulse responses from

with the recent success of self-supervised contrastive learning methods.
Supervised contrastive learning has also been shown to outperform its
cross-entropy counterparts by leveraging labels for choosing where to contrast.
However, there has been little work to explore the transfer capability of
contrastive learning to a different domain. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the transferability of learned representations of
different contrastive approaches for linear evaluation, full-network transfer,
and few-shot recognition on 12 downstream datasets from different domains, and
object detection tasks on MSCOCO and VOC0712. The results show that the
contrastive approaches learn representations that are easily transferable to a
different downstream task. We further observe that the joint objective of
self-supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy/supervised-contrastive loss
leads to better transferability of these models over their supervised
counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the representations learned from the
contrastive approaches contain more low/mid-level semantics than cross-entropy
models, which enables them to quickly adapt to a new task. Our codes and models
will be publicly available to facilitate future research on transferability of
visual representations.</span>

methods. In some target problem domains, there are not many data samples
available, which could significantly hinder the learning process. While data
from similar domains may be leveraged to help through domain adaptation,
obtaining high-quality labeled data for those source domains themselves could
be difficult or costly. To address such challenges on data insufficiency for
classification problem in a target domain, we propose a weak adaptation
learning (WAL) approach that leverages unlabeled data from a similar source
domain, a low-cost weak annotator that produces labels based on task-specific
heuristics, labeling rules, or other methods (albeit with inaccuracy), and a
small amount of labeled data in the target domain. Our approach first conducts
a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with
respect to the data quantity and the performance of the weak annotator, and
then introduces a multi-stage weak adaptation learning method to learn an
accurate classifier by lowering the error bound. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach in learning an accurate classifier with
limited labeled data in the target domain and unlabeled data in the source
domain.</span>

                                        <span>Skeleton sequences are lightweight and compact, thus are ideal candidates for
action recognition on edge devices. Recent skeleton-based action recognition
methods extract features from 3D joint coordinates as spatial-temporal cues,
using these representations in a graph neural network for feature fusion to
boost recognition performance. The use of first- and second-order features,
\ie{} joint and bone representations, has led to high accuracy. Nonetheless,
many models are still confused by actions that have similar motion
trajectories. To address these issues, we propose fusing third-order features
in the form of angular encoding into modern architectures to robustly capture
the relationships between joints and body parts. This simple fusion with
popular spatial-temporal graph neural networks achieves new state-of-the-art
accuracy in two large benchmarks, including NTU60 and NTU120, while employing
fewer parameters and reduced run time. Our source code is publicly available

                                        <span>Recent research shows deep neural networks are vulnerable to different types
of attacks, such as adversarial attack, data poisoning attack and backdoor
attack. Among them, backdoor attack is the most cunning one and can occur in
almost every stage of deep learning pipeline. Therefore, backdoor attack has
attracted lots of interests from both academia and industry. However, most
existing backdoor attack methods are either visible or fragile to some
effortless pre-processing such as common data transformations. To address these
limitations, we propose a robust and invisible backdoor attack called &quot;Poison
Ink&quot;. Concretely, we first leverage the image structures as target poisoning
areas, and fill them with poison ink (information) to generate the trigger
pattern. As the image structure can keep its semantic meaning during the data
transformation, such trigger pattern is inherently robust to data
transformations. Then we leverage a deep injection network to embed such
trigger pattern into the cover image to achieve stealthiness. Compared to
existing popular backdoor attack methods, Poison Ink outperforms both in
stealthiness and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
Poison Ink is not only general to different datasets and network architectures,
but also flexible for different attack scenarios. Besides, it also has very
strong resistance against many state-of-the-art defense techniques.</span>

devices by recognizing status and intention of humans. Communication between
humans and a drone using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most
challenging issues in the BCI domain. In particular, the control of drone
swarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the
control of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually
imagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among EEG
signals of subjects is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this
study, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the
performances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset. This
study is the first attempt to demonstrate the possibility of generalization
among subjects in the VI-based BCI. We used the leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation for evaluating the performances. We obtained higher
performances when including our proposed module than excluding our proposed
module. The DeepConvNet with SEFE showed the highest performance of 0.72 among
six different decoding models. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of
decoding the VI dataset in the subject-independent task with robust

transformers and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have shown
promising progress in human mesh reconstruction. Transformer-based approaches
are effective in modeling non-local interactions among 3D mesh vertices and
body joints, whereas GCNNs are good at exploiting neighborhood vertex
interactions based on a pre-specified mesh topology. In this paper, we study
how to combine graph convolutions and self-attentions in a transformer to model
both local and global interactions. Experimental results show that our proposed

where there are more than one set of slice images in a volume, the features of

                                        <span>Despite much recent progress in video-based person re-identification (re-ID),
the current state-of-the-art still suffers from common real-world challenges
such as appearance similarity among various people, occlusions, and frame
misalignment. To alleviate these problems, we propose Spatio-Temporal
Representation Factorization (STRF), a flexible new computational unit that can
be used in conjunction with most existing 3D convolutional neural network
architectures for re-ID. The key innovations of STRF over prior work include
explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial features,
with each component further factorized to capture complementary person-specific
appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal factorization
comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the color of
clothes) that do not change much over time, and dynamic features (e.g., walking
patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization also comprises
two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as local (finer
segments) appearance features, with the local features particularly useful in
cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two factorization operations
taken together result in a modular architecture for our parameter-wise light
STRF unit that can be plugged in between any two 3D convolutional layers,
resulting in an end-to-end learning framework. We empirically show that STRF
improves performance of various existing baseline architectures while
demonstrating new state-of-the-art results using standard person re-ID
evaluation protocols on three benchmarks.</span>

States. Deep learning methods have been studied to detect guns in surveillance
video cameras or smart IP cameras and to send a real-time alert to security
personals. One problem for the development of gun detection algorithms is the
lack of large public datasets. In this work, we first publish a dataset with
51K annotated gun images for gun detection and other 51K cropped gun chip
images for gun classification we collect from a few different sources. To our
knowledge, this is the largest dataset for the study of gun detection. This
dataset can be downloaded at www.linksprite.com/gun-detection-datasets. We
present a gun detection system using a smart IP camera as an embedded edge
device, and a cloud server as a manager for device, data, alert, and to further
reduce the false positive rate. We study to find solutions for gun detection in
an embedded device, and for gun classification on the edge device and the cloud
server. This edge/cloud framework makes the deployment of gun detection in the
real world possible.</span>

                                        <span>Confidence calibration is of great importance to the reliability of decisions
made by machine learning systems. However, discriminative classifiers based on
deep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident
predictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of
classification accuracy. We argue that such an inability to model uncertainty
is mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the
cross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined
categories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first
time propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the
modeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the
learning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension
that models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,
and moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially
forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution. Extensive
experiments show that our approach, Energy-based Open-World Softmax
(EOW-Softmax), is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods in improving
confidence calibration.</span>

model can easily become overfitted based on the biased distribution formed by
only a few training examples. In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of
these few-sample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with
sufficient examples, then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from
the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume
every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution
so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of
similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number
of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature
extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a
simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from
our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on two

task as a conditional foreground-background segmentation problem, assuming each
class is independent. In this paper, we introduce the concept of meta-class,
which is the meta information (e.g. certain middle-level features) shareable
among all classes. To explicitly learn meta-class representations in few-shot
segmentation task, we propose a novel Meta-class Memory based few-shot
segmentation method (MM-Net), where we introduce a set of learnable memory
embeddings to memorize the meta-class information during the base class
training and transfer to novel classes during the inference stage. Moreover,
for the $k$-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module
to select images from the set of support images. A high-quality class prototype
could be obtained with the weighted sum of support image features based on the
quality measure. Experiments on both PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO dataset shows that
our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot

                                        <span>Gait recognition is one of the most important biometric technologies and has
been applied in many fields. Recent gait recognition frameworks represent each
gait frame by descriptors extracted from either global appearances or local
regions of humans. However, the representations based on global information
often neglect the details of the gait frame, while local region based
descriptors cannot capture the relations among neighboring regions, thus
reducing their discriminativeness. In this paper, we propose a novel feature
extraction and fusion framework to achieve discriminative feature
representations for gait recognition. Towards this goal, we take advantage of
both global visual information and local region details and develop a Global
and Local Feature Extractor (GLFE). Specifically, our GLFE module is composed
of our newly designed multiple global and local convolutional layers (GLConv)
to ensemble global and local features in a principle manner. Furthermore, we
present a novel operation, namely Local Temporal Aggregation (LTA), to further
preserve the spatial information by reducing the temporal resolution to obtain
higher spatial resolution. With the help of our GLFE and LTA, our method
significantly improves the discriminativeness of our visual features, thus
improving the gait recognition performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art gait recognition methods

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method to train efficient networks
(&quot;student&quot;) with the help of high-capacity networks (&quot;teacher&quot;). Traditional
methods use the teacher&#x27;s soft logits as extra supervision to train the student
network. In this paper, we argue that it is more advantageous to make the
student mimic the teacher&#x27;s features in the penultimate layer. Not only the
student can directly learn more effective information from the teacher feature,
feature mimicking can also be applied for teachers trained without a softmax
layer. Experiments show that it can achieve higher accuracy than traditional
KD. To further facilitate feature mimicking, we decompose a feature vector into
the magnitude and the direction. We argue that the teacher should give more
freedom to the student feature&#x27;s magnitude, and let the student pay more
attention on mimicking the feature direction. To meet this requirement, we
propose a loss term based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). With the help of
this new loss, our method indeed mimics feature directions more accurately,
relaxes constraints on feature magnitudes, and achieves state-of-the-art
distillation accuracy. We provide theoretical analyses of how LSH facilitates
feature direction mimicking, and further extend feature mimicking to
multi-label recognition and object detection.</span>

                                        <span>This paper tackles the task of category-level pose estimation for garments.
With a near infinite degree of freedom, a garment&#x27;s full configuration (i.e.,
poses) is often described by the per-vertex 3D locations of its entire 3D
surface. However, garments are also commonly subject to extreme cases of
self-occlusion, especially when folded or crumpled, making it challenging to
perceive their full 3D surface. To address these challenges, we propose
GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose
estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This
canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category,
therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed
partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the
output representation describes the garment&#x27;s full configuration using a
complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label. To properly
handle the thin 3D structure presented on garments, we proposed a novel 3D
shape representation using the generalized winding number field. Experiments
demonstrate that GarmentNets is able to generalize to unseen garment instances
and achieve significantly better performance compared to alternative
approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Background: Underwater images, in general, suffer from low contrast and high
color distortions due to the non-uniform attenuation of the light as it
propagates through the water. In addition, the degree of attenuation varies
with the wavelength resulting in the asymmetric traversing of colors. Despite
the prolific works for underwater image restoration (UIR) using deep learning,
the above asymmetricity has not been addressed in the respective network
engineering.

Contributions: As the first novelty, this paper shows that attributing the
right receptive field size (context) based on the traversing range of the color
channel may lead to a substantial performance gain for the task of UIR.
Further, it is important to suppress the irrelevant multi-contextual features
and increase the representational power of the model. Therefore, as a second
novelty, we have incorporated an attentive skip mechanism to adaptively refine
the learned multi-contextual features. The proposed framework, called Deep
WaveNet, is optimized using the traditional pixel-wise and feature-based cost
functions. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out to show the
efficacy of the proposed scheme over existing best-published literature on
benchmark datasets. More importantly, we have demonstrated a comprehensive
validation of enhanced images across various high-level vision tasks, e.g.,
underwater image semantic segmentation, and diver&#x27;s 2D pose estimation. A
sample video to exhibit our real-world performance is available at

                                        <span>The goal of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) is to estimate the
perceptual image quality in accordance with subjective evaluations, it is a
complex and unsolved problem due to the absence of the pristine reference
image. In this paper, we propose a novel model to address the NR-IQA task by
leveraging a hybrid approach that benefits from Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and self-attention mechanism in Transformers to extract both local and
non-local features from the input image. We capture local structure information
of the image via CNNs, then to circumvent the locality bias among the extracted
CNNs features and obtain a non-local representation of the image, we utilize
Transformers on the extracted features where we model them as a sequential
input to the Transformer model. Furthermore, to improve the monotonicity
correlation between the subjective and objective scores, we utilize the
relative distance information among the images within each batch and enforce
the relative ranking among them. Last but not least, we observe that the
performance of NR-IQA models degrades when we apply equivariant transformations
(e.g. horizontal flipping) to the inputs. Therefore, we propose a method that
leverages self-consistency as a source of self-supervision to improve the
robustness of NRIQA models. Specifically, we enforce self-consistency between
the outputs of our quality assessment model for each image and its
transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich self-supervisory
information and reduce the uncertainty of the model. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our work, we evaluate it on seven standard IQA datasets (both
synthetic and authentic) and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on various datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can achieve human-level
performance in edge detection with the rich and abstract edge representation
capacities. However, the high performance of CNN based edge detection is
achieved with a large pretrained CNN backbone, which is memory and energy
consuming. In addition, it is surprising that the previous wisdom from the
traditional edge detectors, such as Canny, Sobel, and LBP are rarely
investigated in the rapid-developing deep learning era. To address these
issues, we propose a simple, lightweight yet effective architecture named Pixel
Difference Network (PiDiNet) for efficient edge detection. Extensive
experiments on BSDS500, NYUD, and Multicue are provided to demonstrate its
effectiveness, and its high training and inference efficiency. Surprisingly,
when training from scratch with only the BSDS500 and VOC datasets, PiDiNet can
surpass the recorded result of human perception (0.807 vs. 0.803 in ODS
F-measure) on the BSDS500 dataset with 100 FPS and less than 1M parameters. A
faster version of PiDiNet with less than 0.1M parameters can still achieve
comparable performance among state of the arts with 200 FPS. Results on the
NYUD and Multicue datasets show similar observations. The codes are available

                                        <span>The capsule network is a distinct and promising segment of the neural network
family that drew attention due to its unique ability to maintain the
equivariance property by preserving the spatial relationship amongst the
features. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success over image
classification tasks with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the
characteristic features into the capsules and building the parse-tree
structure. However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background
regions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal
due to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting
complex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network
architecture for efficiently dealing with complex images. The proposed method
incorporates wide bottleneck residual modules and the Squeeze and Excitation
attention blocks upheld by the modified FM routing algorithm to address the
defined problem. A wide bottleneck residual module facilitates extracting
complex features followed by the squeeze and excitation attention block to
enable channel-wise attention by suppressing the trivial features. This setup
allows channel inter-dependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby
enhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images. We
extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on three publicly
available datasets, namely CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and SVHN, to outperform the
top-5 performance on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST with highly competitive
performance on the SVHN dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning for depth estimation possesses several advantages
over supervised learning. The benefits of no need for ground-truth depth,
online fine-tuning, and better generalization with unlimited data attract
researchers to seek self-supervised solutions. In this work, we propose a new
self-supervised framework for stereo matching utilizing multiple images
captured at aligned camera positions. A cross photometric loss, an
uncertainty-aware mutual-supervision loss, and a new smoothness loss are
introduced to optimize the network in learning disparity maps end-to-end
without ground-truth depth information. To train this framework, we build a new
multiscopic dataset consisting of synthetic images rendered by 3D engines and
real images captured by real cameras. After being trained with only the
synthetic images, our network can perform well in unseen outdoor scenes. Our
experiment shows that our model obtains better disparity maps than previous
unsupervised methods on the KITTI dataset and is comparable to supervised
methods when generalized to unseen data. Our source code and dataset are

computational demands are hindering the deployment to mobile devices. Here we
present a vision transformer pruning approach, which identifies the impacts of
dimensions in each layer of transformer and then executes pruning accordingly.
By encouraging dimension-wise sparsity in the transformer, important dimensions
automatically emerge. A great number of dimensions with small importance scores
can be discarded to achieve a high pruning ratio without significantly
compromising accuracy. The pipeline for vision transformer pruning is as
follows: 1) training with sparsity regularization; 2) pruning dimensions of
linear projections; 3) fine-tuning. The reduced parameters and FLOPs ratios of

regression of the target object based on the similarity maps. However, they
either employ a single map from the last convolutional layer which degrades the
localization accuracy in complex scenarios or separately use multiple maps for
decision making, introducing intractable computations for aerial mobile
platforms. Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective
hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical
similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the
feature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow
layers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global
contextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also
our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the
interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a
tracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability. Comprehensive
evaluations on four aerial benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of HiFT.
Real-world tests on the aerial platform have strongly validated its
practicability with a real-time speed. Our code is available at

efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship
between multimedia data. However, existing methods have the following
shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large
scale due to the graph construction and eigen-decomposition. (2) They cannot
well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor
points and tensor Schatten p-norm minimization. Specifically, we construct a
hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.
Extensive experimental results on several datasets indicate that our proposed

                                        <span>Quantification of uncertainty in deep-neural-networks (DNN) based image
registration algorithms plays an important role in the safe deployment of
real-world medical applications and research-oriented processing pipelines, and
in improving generalization capabilities. Currently available approaches for
uncertainty estimation, including the variational encoder-decoder architecture
and the inference-time dropout approach, require specific network architectures
and assume parametric distribution of the latent space which may result in
sub-optimal characterization of the posterior distribution for the predicted
deformation-fields. We introduce the NPBDREG, a fully non-parametric Bayesian
framework for unsupervised DNN-based deformable image registration by combining
an \texttt{Adam} optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to
characterize the true posterior distribution through posterior sampling. The
NPBDREG provides a principled non-parametric way to characterize the true
posterior distribution, thus providing improved uncertainty estimates and
confidence measures in a theoretically well-founded and computationally
efficient way. We demonstrated the added-value of NPBDREG, compared to the
baseline probabilistic \texttt{VoxelMorph} unsupervised model (PrVXM), on brain
MRI images registration using $390$ image pairs from four publicly available
databases: MGH10, CMUC12, ISBR18 and LPBA40. The NPBDREG shows a slight
improvement in the registration accuracy compared to PrVXM (Dice score of
$0.73$ vs. $0.68$, $p \ll 0.01$), a better generalization capability for data
corrupted by a mixed structure noise (e.g Dice score of $0.729$ vs. $0.686$ for
$\alpha&#x3D;0.2$) and last but foremost, a significantly better correlation of the
predicted uncertainty with out-of-distribution data ($r&gt;0.95$ vs. $r&lt;0.5$).</span>

                                        <span>Scene text recognition (STR) is a challenging task in computer vision due to
the large number of possible text appearances in natural scenes. Most STR
models rely on synthetic datasets for training since there are no sufficiently
big and publicly available labelled real datasets. Since STR models are
evaluated using real data, the mismatch between training and testing data
distributions results into poor performance of models especially on challenging
text that are affected by noise, artifacts, geometry, structure, etc. In this
paper, we introduce STRAug which is made of 36 image augmentation functions
designed for STR. Each function mimics certain text image properties that can
be found in natural scenes, caused by camera sensors, or induced by signal
processing operations but poorly represented in the training dataset. When
applied to strong baseline models using RandAugment, STRAug significantly
increases the overall absolute accuracy of STR models across regular and
irregular test datasets by as much as 2.10% on Rosetta, 1.48% on R2AM, 1.30% on
CRNN, 1.35% on RARE, 1.06% on TRBA and 0.89% on GCRNN. The diversity and
simplicity of API provided by STRAug functions enable easy replication and
validation of existing data augmentation methods for STR. STRAug is available

                                        <span>The classic Monte Carlo path tracing can achieve high quality rendering at
the cost of heavy computation. Recent works make use of deep neural networks to
accelerate this process, by improving either low-resolution or fewer-sample
rendering with super-resolution or denoising neural networks in
post-processing. However, denoising and super-resolution have only been
considered separately in previous work. We show in this work that Monte Carlo
path tracing can be further accelerated by joint super-resolution and denoising
(SRD) in post-processing. This new type of joint filtering allows only a
low-resolution and fewer-sample (thus noisy) image to be rendered by path
tracing, which is then fed into a deep neural network to produce a
high-resolution and clean image. The main contribution of this work is a new
end-to-end network architecture, specifically designed for the SRD task. It
contains two cascaded stages with shared components. We discover that denoising
and super-resolution require very different receptive fields, a key insight
that leads to the introduction of deformable convolution into the network
design. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
previous methods and their variants adopted for the SRD task.</span>

fabric defect detection, which come with the cost of expensive training and
complex model parameters. With the observation that most fabrics are defect
free in practice, a two-step Cascaded Zoom-In Network (CZI-Net) is proposed for
patterned fabric defect detection. In the CZI-Net, the Aggregated HOG (A-HOG)
and SIFT features are used to instead of simple convolution filters for feature
extraction. Moreover, in order to extract more distinctive features, the
feature representation layer and full connection layer are included in the
CZI-Net. In practice, Most defect-free fabrics only involve in the first step
of our method and avoid a costive computation in the second step, which makes
very fast fabric detection. More importantly, we propose the
Locality-constrained Reconstruction Error (LCRE) in the first step and
Restrictive Locality-constrained Coding (RLC), Bag-of-Indexes (BoI) methods in
the second step. We also analyse the connections between different coding
methods and conclude that the index of visual words plays an essential role in
the coding methods. In conclusion, experiments based on real-world datasets are
implemented and demonstrate that our proposed method is not only
computationally simple but also with high detection accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>We address the problem of generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3)
predicting pixel-wise semantic labels for seen and unseen classes. Most GZS3
methods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen
classes from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel
classifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show
decent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are
biased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever
novel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address
these limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and
semantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder
transforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for
visual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce
boundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn
discriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space,
together with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time,
we avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a
nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we
also propose an inference technique, dubbed Apollonius calibration (AC), that
modulates the decision boundary of the NN classifier to the Apollonius circle
adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework, achieving a new state of the art on standard benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial domain adaptation has made impressive advances in transferring
knowledge from the source domain to the target domain by aligning feature
distributions of both domains. These methods focus on minimizing domain
divergence and regard the adaptability, which is measured as the expected error
of the ideal joint hypothesis on these two domains, as a small constant.
However, these approaches still face two issues: (1) Adversarial domain
alignment distorts the original feature distributions, deteriorating the
adaptability; (2) Transforming feature representations to be domain-invariant
needs to sacrifice domain-specific variations, resulting in weaker
discriminability. In order to alleviate these issues, we propose
category-invariant feature enhancement (CIFE), a general mechanism that
enhances the adversarial domain adaptation through optimizing the adaptability.
Specifically, the CIFE approach introduces category-invariant features to boost
the discriminability of domain-invariant features with preserving the
transferability. Experiments show that the CIFE could improve upon
representative adversarial domain adaptation methods to yield state-of-the-art
results on five benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Removing undesirable specular highlight from a single input image is of
crucial importance to many computer vision and graphics tasks. Existing methods
typically remove specular highlight for medical images and specific-object
images, however, they cannot handle the images with text. In addition, the
impact of specular highlight on text recognition is rarely studied by text
detection and recognition community. Therefore, in this paper, we first raise
and study the text-aware single image specular highlight removal problem. The
core goal is to improve the accuracy of text detection and recognition by
removing the highlight from text images. To tackle this challenging problem, we
first collect three high-quality datasets with fine-grained annotations, which
will be appropriately released to facilitate the relevant research. Then, we
design a novel two-stage network, which contains a highlight detection network
and a highlight removal network. The output of highlight detection network
provides additional information about highlight regions to guide the subsequent
highlight removal network. Moreover, we suggest a measurement set including the
end-to-end text detection and recognition evaluation and auxiliary visual
quality evaluation. Extensive experiments on our collected datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Food image classification is challenging for real-world applications since
existing methods require static datasets for training and are not capable of
learning from sequentially available new food images. Online continual learning
aims to learn new classes from data stream by using each new data only once
without forgetting the previously learned knowledge. However, none of the
existing works target food image analysis, which is more difficult to learn
incrementally due to its high intra-class variation with the unbalanced and
unpredictable characteristics of future food class distribution. In this paper,
we address these issues by introducing (1) a novel clustering based exemplar
selection algorithm to store the most representative data belonging to each
learned food for knowledge replay, and (2) an effective online learning regime
using balanced training batch along with the knowledge distillation on
augmented exemplars to maintain the model performance on all learned classes.
Our method is evaluated on a challenging large scale food image database,
Food-1K, by varying the number of newly added food classes. Our results show
significant improvements compared with existing state-of-the-art online
continual learning methods, showing great potential to achieve lifelong
learning for food image classification in real world.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional video inpainting is neither object-oriented nor occlusion-aware,
making it liable to obvious artifacts when large occluded object regions are
inpainted. This paper presents occlusion-aware video object inpainting, which
recovers both the complete shape and appearance for occluded objects in videos
given their visible mask segmentation.

To facilitate this new research, we construct the first large-scale video
object inpainting benchmark YouTube-VOI to provide realistic occlusion
scenarios with both occluded and visible object masks available. Our technical
contribution VOIN jointly performs video object shape completion and occluded
texture generation. In particular, the shape completion module models
long-range object coherence while the flow completion module recovers accurate
flow with sharp motion boundary, for propagating temporally-consistent texture
to the same moving object across frames. For more realistic results, VOIN is
optimized using both T-PatchGAN and a new spatio-temporal attention-based
multi-class discriminator.

Finally, we compare VOIN and strong baselines on YouTube-VOI. Experimental
results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our method including inpainting
complex and dynamic objects. VOIN degrades gracefully with inaccurate input
visible mask.</span>

                                        <span>Most publicly available datasets for image classification are with single
labels, while images are inherently multi-labeled in our daily life. Such an
annotation gap makes many pre-trained single-label classification models fail
in practical scenarios. This annotation issue is more concerned for aerial
images: Aerial data collected from sensors naturally cover a relatively large
land area with multiple labels, while annotated aerial datasets, which are
publicly available (e.g., UCM, AID), are single-labeled. As manually annotating
multi-label aerial images would be time/labor-consuming, we propose a novel
self-correction integrated domain adaptation (SCIDA) method for automatic
multi-label learning. SCIDA is weakly supervised, i.e., automatically learning
the multi-label image classification model from using massive, publicly
available single-label images. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel
Label-Wise self-Correction (LWC) module to better explore underlying label
correlations. This module also makes the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
from single- to multi-label data possible. For model training, the proposed
model only uses single-label information yet requires no prior knowledge of
multi-labeled data; and it predicts labels for multi-label aerial images. In
our experiments, trained with single-labeled MAI-AID-s and MAI-UCM-s datasets,
the proposed model is tested directly on our collected Multi-scene Aerial Image
(MAI) dataset.</span>

detection tasks. However, they have large computational and energy requirements
that challenge their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Object
detection takes an image as an input, and identifies the existing object
classes as well as their locations in the image. In this paper, we leverage the
prior knowledge about the probabilities that different object categories can
occur jointly to increase the efficiency of object detection models. In
particular, our technique clusters the object categories based on their spatial
co-occurrence probability. We use those clusters to design an adaptive network.
During runtime, a branch controller decides which part(s) of the network to
execute based on the spatial context of the input frame. Our experiments using
COCO dataset show that our adaptive object detection model achieves up to 45%
reduction in the energy consumption, and up to 27% reduction in the latency,
with a small loss in the average precision (AP) of object detection.</span>

potential of multi-rotor drones in many social and industrial applications. The
implementation and testing of this capability on physical platforms is risky
and resource-intensive; hence, in order to ensure both a sound design process
and a safe deployment, simulations are required before implementing a physical
prototype. This paper presents the development of a monocular visual system,
using a software-in-the-loop methodology, that autonomously and efficiently
lands a quadcopter drone on a predefined landing pad, thus reducing the risks
of the physical testing stage. In addition to ensuring that the autonomous
landing system as a whole fulfils the design requirements using a Gazebo-based
simulation, our approach provides a tool for safe parameter tuning and design
testing prior to physical implementation. Finally, the proposed monocular
vision-only approach to landing pad tracking made it possible to effectively
implement the system in an F450 quadcopter drone with the standard
computational capabilities of an Odroid XU4 embedded processor.</span>

                                        <span>Underwater cameras are typically placed behind glass windows to protect them
from the water. Spherical glass, a dome port, is well suited for high water
pressures at great depth, allows for a large field of view, and avoids
refraction if a pinhole camera is positioned exactly at the sphere&#x27;s center.
Adjusting a real lens perfectly to the dome center is a challenging task, both
in terms of how to actually guide the centering process (e.g. visual servoing)
and how to measure the alignment quality, but also, how to mechanically perform
the alignment. Consequently, such systems are prone to being decentered by some
offset, leading to challenging refraction patterns at the sphere that
invalidate the pinhole camera model. We show that the overall camera system
becomes an axial camera, even for thick domes as used for deep sea exploration
and provide a non-iterative way to compute the center of refraction without
requiring knowledge of exact air, glass or water properties. We also analyze
the refractive geometry at the sphere, looking at effects such as forward- vs.
backward decentering, iso-refraction curves and obtain a 6th-degree polynomial
equation for forward projection of 3D points in thin domes. We then propose a
pure underwater calibration procedure to estimate the decentering from multiple
images. This estimate can either be used during adjustment to guide the
mechanical position of the lens, or can be considered in photogrammetric
underwater applications.</span>

based on deep neural networks have been proposed for the pixel-level

extract local structural as well as global contextual information. We performed
segmentation of glioma sub-regions, including tumor core, enhancing tumor, and

                                        <span>Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has attracted increasing
research interests because of its scalability and possibility for real-world
applications. State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods usually follow a
clustering-based strategy, which generates pseudo labels by clustering and
maintains a memory to store instance features and represent the centroid of the
clusters for contrastive learning. This approach suffers two problems. First,
the centroid generated by unsupervised learning may not be a perfect prototype.
Forcing images to get closer to the centroid emphasizes the result of
clustering, which could accumulate clustering errors during iterations. Second,
previous methods utilize features obtained at different training iterations to
represent one centroid, which is not consistent with the current training
sample, since the features are not directly comparable. To this end, we propose
an unsupervised re-ID approach with a stochastic learning strategy.
Specifically, we adopt a stochastic updated memory, where a random instance
from a cluster is used to update the cluster-level memory for contrastive
learning. In this way, the relationship between randomly selected pair of
images are learned to avoid the training bias caused by unreliable pseudo
labels. The stochastic memory is also always up-to-date for classifying to keep
the consistency. Besides, to relieve the issue of camera variance, a unified
distance matrix is proposed during clustering, where the distance bias from
different camera domain is reduced and the variances of identities is
emphasized.</span>

                                        <span>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common eye conditions among
diabetic patients. However, vision loss occurs primarily in the late stages of
DR, and the symptoms of visual impairment, ranging from mild to severe, can
vary greatly, adding to the burden of diagnosis and treatment in clinical
practice. Deep learning methods based on retinal images have achieved
remarkable success in automatic DR grading, but most of them neglect that the
presence of diabetes usually affects both eyes, and ophthalmologists usually
compare both eyes concurrently for DR diagnosis, leaving correlations between
left and right eyes unexploited. In this study, simulating the diagnostic
process, we propose a two-stream binocular network to capture the subtle
correlations between left and right eyes, in which, paired images of eyes are
fed into two identical subnetworks separately during training. We design a
contrastive grading loss to learn binocular correlation for five-class DR
detection, which maximizes inter-class dissimilarity while minimizing the
intra-class difference. Experimental results on the EyePACS dataset show the
superiority of the proposed binocular model, outperforming monocular methods by
a large margin.</span>

broadcast, providing richer experiences and valuable insights to fans. The
first step of augmented reality systems is camera calibration, possibly based
on detecting the line markings of the field of play. Most existing proposals
for line detection rely on edge detection and Hough transform, but optical
distortion and extraneous edges cause inaccurate or spurious detections of line
markings. We propose a novel strategy to automatically and accurately segment
line markings based on a stochastic watershed transform that is robust to
optical distortions, since it makes no assumptions about line straightness, and
is unaffected by the presence of players or the ball in the field of play.
Firstly, the playing field as a whole is segmented completely eliminating the
stands and perimeter boards. Then the line markings are extracted.

The strategy has been tested on a new and public database composed by 60
annotated images from matches in five stadiums. The results obtained have
proven that the proposed segmentation algorithm allows successful and precise
detection of most line mark pixels.</span>

                                        <span>Fine-grained action recognition is attracting increasing attention due to the
emerging demand of specific action understanding in real-world applications,
whereas the data of rare fine-grained categories is very limited. Therefore, we
propose the few-shot fine-grained action recognition problem, aiming to
recognize novel fine-grained actions with only few samples given for each
class. Although progress has been made in coarse-grained actions, existing
few-shot recognition methods encounter two issues handling fine-grained
actions: the inability to capture subtle action details and the inadequacy in
learning from data with low inter-class variance. To tackle the first issue, a
human vision inspired bidirectional attention module (BAM) is proposed.
Combining top-down task-driven signals with bottom-up salient stimuli, BAM
captures subtle action details by accurately highlighting informative
spatio-temporal regions. To address the second issue, we introduce contrastive
meta-learning (CML). Compared with the widely adopted ProtoNet-based method,
CML generates more discriminative video representations for low inter-class
variance data, since it makes full use of potential contrastive pairs in each
training episode. Furthermore, to fairly compare different models, we establish
specific benchmark protocols on two large-scale fine-grained action recognition
datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across evaluated tasks.</span>

                                        <span>In autonomous driving, a LiDAR-based object detector should perform reliably
at different geographic locations and under various weather conditions. While
recent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single
domain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop
drastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain
Adaptation dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the
root cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic
Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR
detectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at
the predicted foreground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the
foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low
reflectance or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the
original points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly
consumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors. To validate the wide applicability of
SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.
On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object
categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit
object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI,
SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories.
Combined with PV-RCNN, SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on
KITTI.</span>

propose a transformer module called Point-Track-Transformer (PTT) for point
cloud-based 3D single object tracking. PTT module contains three blocks for
feature embedding, position encoding, and self-attention feature computation.
Feature embedding aims to place features closer in the embedding space if they
have similar semantic information. Position encoding is used to encode
coordinates of point clouds into high dimension distinguishable features.
Self-attention generates refined attention features by computing attention
weights. Besides, we embed the PTT module into the open-source state-of-the-art
method P2B to construct PTT-Net. Experiments on the KITTI dataset reveal that
our PTT-Net surpasses the state-of-the-art by a noticeable margin (~10\%).
Additionally, PTT-Net could achieve real-time performance (~40FPS) on NVIDIA
1080Ti GPU. Our code is open-sourced for the robotics community at

                                        <span>This paper investigates the problem of reconstructing hyperspectral (HS)
images from single RGB images captured by commercial cameras, \textbf{without}
using paired HS and RGB images during training. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a new lightweight and end-to-end learning-based framework.
Specifically, on the basis of the intrinsic imaging degradation model of RGB
images from HS images, we progressively spread the differences between input
RGB images and re-projected RGB images from recovered HS images via effective
unsupervised camera spectral response function estimation. To enable the
learning without paired ground-truth HS images as supervision, we adopt the
adversarial learning manner and boost it with a simple yet effective
$\mathcal{L}_1$ gradient clipping scheme. Besides, we embed the semantic
information of input RGB images to locally regularize the unsupervised
learning, which is expected to promote pixels with identical semantics to have
consistent spectral signatures. In addition to conducting quantitative
experiments over two widely-used datasets for HS image reconstruction from
synthetic RGB images, we also evaluate our method by applying recovered HS
images from real RGB images to HS-based visual tracking. Extensive results show
that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods
and even exceeds the latest supervised method under some settings. The source

                                        <span>Surface defect detection plays an increasingly important role in
manufacturing industry to guarantee the product quality. Many deep learning
methods have been widely used in surface defect detection tasks, and have been
proven to perform well in defects classification and location. However, deep
learning-based detection methods often require plenty of data for training,
which fail to apply to the real industrial scenarios since the distribution of
defect categories is often imbalanced. In other words, common defect classes
have many samples but rare defect classes have extremely few samples, and it is
difficult for these methods to well detect rare defect classes. To solve the
imbalanced distribution problem, in this paper we propose TL-SDD: a novel
Transfer Learning-based method for Surface Defect Detection. First, we adopt a
two-phase training scheme to transfer the knowledge from common defect classes
to rare defect classes. Second, we propose a novel Metric-based Surface Defect
Detection (M-SDD) model. We design three modules for this model: (1) feature
extraction module: containing feature fusion which combines high-level semantic
information with low-level structural information. (2) feature reweighting
module: transforming examples to a reweighting vector that indicates the
importance of features. (3) distance metric module: learning a metric space in
which defects are classified by computing distances to representations of each
category. Finally, we validate the performance of our proposed method on a real
dataset including surface defects of aluminum profiles. Compared to the
baseline methods, the performance of our proposed method has improved by up to
11.98% for rare defect classes.</span>

                                        <span>Most recent studies on detecting and localizing temporal anomalies have
mainly employed deep neural networks to learn the normal patterns of temporal
data in an unsupervised manner. Unlike them, the goal of our work is to fully
utilize instance-level (or weak) anomaly labels, which only indicate whether
any anomalous events occurred or not in each instance of temporal data. In this
paper, we present WETAS, a novel framework that effectively identifies
anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input
instance. WETAS learns discriminative features from the instance-level labels
so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within
each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the
dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its
segmentation mask, WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and
simultaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional
supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other
baselines in terms of the localization of temporal anomalies, and also it
provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic security inspection using computer vision technology is a
challenging task in real-world scenarios due to various factors, including
intra-class variance, class imbalance, and occlusion. Most of the previous
methods rarely solve the cases that the prohibited items are deliberately
hidden in messy objects due to the lack of large-scale datasets, restricted
their applications in real-world scenarios. Towards real-world prohibited item
detection, we collect a large-scale dataset, named as PIDray, which covers
various cases in real-world scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially
for deliberately hidden items. With an intensive amount of effort, our dataset
contains $12$ categories of prohibited items in $47,677$ X-ray images with
high-quality annotated segmentation masks and bounding boxes. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the largest prohibited items detection dataset to date.
Meanwhile, we design the selective dense attention network (SDANet) to
construct a strong baseline, which consists of the dense attention module and
the dependency refinement module. The dense attention module formed by the
spatial and channel-wise dense attentions, is designed to learn the
discriminative features to boost the performance. The dependency refinement
module is used to exploit the dependencies of multi-scale features. Extensive
experiments conducted on the collected PIDray dataset demonstrate that the
proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods,
especially for detecting the deliberately hidden items.</span>

methods require a large number of high-quality 3D annotations, which are
expensive to collect. Especially for outdoor scenes, the problem becomes more
severe due to the sparseness of the point cloud and the complexity of urban
scenes. Semi-supervised learning is a promising technique to mitigate the data

outstanding results in many applications. Generative Adversarial Networks are
powerful yet, resource-hungry deep-learning models. Their main difference from
ordinary deep learning models is the nature of their output. For example, GAN
output can be a whole image versus other models detecting objects or
classifying images. Thus, the architecture and numeric precision of the network
affect the quality and speed of the solution. Hence, accelerating GANs is
pivotal. Accelerating GANs can be classified into three main tracks: (1) Memory
compression, (2) Computation optimization, and (3) Data-flow optimization.
Because data transfer is the main source of energy usage, memory compression
leads to the most savings. Thus, in this paper, we survey memory compression
techniques for CNN-Based GANs. Additionally, the paper summarizes opportunities
and challenges in GANs acceleration and suggests open research problems to be
further investigated.</span>

slice passing through the middle of the third lumbar area (L3) and segmenting

method for accurate localization of the L3 CT slice. Our method trains a
reinforcement learning agent by incentivizing it to discover the right

follow for this problem. Visualizing the training process shows that the agent
mimics the scrolling of an experienced radiologist. Extensive experiments

often faces more severe overfitting (than classical supervised learning) as the
supervised source loss has clear domain gap and the unsupervised target loss is
often noisy due to the lack of annotations. This paper presents RDA, a robust
domain adaptation technique that introduces adversarial attacking to mitigate
overfitting in UDA. We achieve robust domain adaptation by a novel Fourier
adversarial attacking (FAA) method that allows large magnitude of perturbation
noises but has minimal modification of image semantics, the former is critical
to the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence
of &#x27;domain gaps&#x27;. Specifically, FAA decomposes images into multiple frequency
components (FCs) and generates adversarial samples by just perturbating certain
FCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the
training can continue the &#x27;random walk&#x27; and drift into an area with a flat loss
landscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation. Extensive experiments over
multiple domain adaptation tasks show that RDA can work with different computer
vision tasks with superior performance.</span>

home. Each natural person typically has several digital identities with
different associated information. During the last years, various identity and
access management approaches have gained attraction, helping for example to
access other organization&#x27;s services within trust boundaries. The resulting
heterogeneity creates a high complexity to differentiate between these
approaches and scenarios as participating entity; combining them is even
harder. Last but not least, various actors have a different understanding or
perspective of the terms, like &#x27;service&#x27;, in this context. Our paper describes
a reference service with standard components in generic federated identity
management. This is utilized with modern Enterprise Architecture using the
framework ArchiMate. The proposed universal federated identity management
service model (FIMSM) is applied to describe various federated identity
management scenarios in a generic service-oriented way. The presented reference
design is approved in multiple aspects and is easily applicable in numerous
scenarios.</span>

of robust models that are equipped to handle real-world data. However, if the
bad data contains insufficient anatomical information, it can have a severe
negative effect on the model&#x27;s performance. We propose a novel methodology

Field of View. The model trains on this reference set and identifies bad data
by using the Siamese network to compute the distance between the reference set
and all other medical images in the dataset. This methodology achieves an Area

                                        <span>Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research
interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation --- describing a shape
as a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and
point clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely
used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the
sequential and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant
challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD
operations and natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on
the Transformer. We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape
autoencoding and random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new
CAD dataset consisting of 178,238 models and their CAD construction sequences.
We have made this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this

                                        <span>To build a robust and practical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system
that is applicable to a clinical brain MRI database, we propose a new framework
-- Disease-oriented image embedding with pseudo-scanner standardization
(DI-PSS) -- that consists of two core techniques, data harmonization and a
dimension reduction algorithm. Our DI-PSS uses skull stripping and
CycleGAN-based image transformations that map to a standard brain followed by
transformation into a brain image taken with a given reference scanner. Then,
our 3D convolutioinal autoencoders (3D-CAE) with deep metric learning acquires
a low-dimensional embedding that better reflects the characteristics of the
disease. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested on the
T1-weighted MRIs selected from the Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
and the Parkinson&#x27;s Progression Markers Initiative. We confirmed that our PSS
greatly reduced the variability of low-dimensional embeddings caused by
different scanner and datasets. Compared with the baseline condition, our PSS
reduced the variability in the distance from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) to
clinically normal (CN) and Parkinson disease (PD) cases by 15.8-22.6% and
18.0-29.9%, respectively. These properties allow DI-PSS to generate lower
dimensional representations that are more amenable to disease classification.
In AD and CN classification experiments based on spectral clustering, PSS
improved the average accuracy and macro-F1 by 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.
Given the potential of the DI-PSS for harmonizing images scanned by MRI
scanners that were not used to scan the training data, we expect that the
DI-PSS is suitable for application to a large number of legacy MRIs scanned in
heterogeneous environments.</span>

in computer vision: self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViT).
While the training recipes for standard convolutional networks have been highly
mature and robust, the recipes for ViT are yet to be built, especially in the
self-supervised scenarios where training becomes more challenging. In this
work, we go back to basics and investigate the effects of several fundamental
components for training self-supervised ViT. We observe that instability is a
major issue that degrades accuracy, and it can be hidden by apparently good
results. We reveal that these results are indeed partial failure, and they can
be improved when training is made more stable. We benchmark ViT results in MoCo
v3 and several other self-supervised frameworks, with ablations in various
aspects. We discuss the currently positive evidence as well as challenges and
open questions. We hope that this work will provide useful data points and

supervised learning always dominates change detection using many pairwise
labeled bitemporal images. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to
pairwise label large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sensing images. In this paper,
we propose single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for change detection from
a new perspective of exploiting object changes in unpaired images as
supervisory signals. STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector
only using \textbf{unpaired} labeled images and generalize to real-world
bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple
yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep
semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive
experimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large
margin under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance
under bitemporal supervision. Code is available at

leap-forwards in dense image prediction. However, the issue of feature
alignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity.
Direct pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature
maps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications
in prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a
feature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to
contextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature
selection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial
details. We then integrate these two modules in a top-down pyramidal
architecture and present the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN). Extensive
experimental evaluations on four dense prediction tasks and four datasets have
demonstrated the efficacy of FaPN, yielding an overall improvement of 1.2 - 2.6
points in AP / mIoU over FPN when paired with Faster / Mask R-CNN. In
particular, our FaPN achieves the state-of-the-art of 56.7% mIoU on ADE20K when
integrated within Mask-Former. The code is available from

intuition to leveraging search algorithms guided by evaluation metrics. We
study channel size optimization in convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
identify the role it plays in model accuracy and complexity. Current channel
size selection methods are generally limited by discrete sample spaces while
suffering from manual iteration and simple heuristics. To solve this, we
introduce an efficient dynamic scaling algorithm -- CONet -- that automatically
optimizes channel sizes across network layers for a given CNN. Two metrics --
&#x60;&#x60;\textit{Rank}&quot; and &quot;\textit{Rank Average Slope}&quot; -- are introduced to

scales channel sizes up or down over a fixed searching phase. We conduct

efficient and accurate architectures searched in ResNet, DARTS, and DARTS+

                                        <span>We propose a novel video frame interpolation algorithm based on asymmetric
bilateral motion estimation (ABME), which synthesizes an intermediate frame
between two input frames. First, we predict symmetric bilateral motion fields
to interpolate an anchor frame. Second, we estimate asymmetric bilateral
motions fields from the anchor frame to the input frames. Third, we use the
asymmetric fields to warp the input frames backward and reconstruct the
intermediate frame. Last, to refine the intermediate frame, we develop a new
synthesis network that generates a set of dynamic filters and a residual frame
using local and global information. Experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm achieves excellent performance on various datasets. The source codes

perturbations contribute to the attacking task. We estimate attributions of
different image regions to the decrease of the attacking cost based on the
Shapley value. We define and quantify interactions among adversarial
perturbation pixels, and decompose the entire perturbation map into relatively
independent perturbation components. The decomposition of the perturbation map
shows that adversarially-trained DNNs have more perturbation components in the
foreground than normally-trained DNNs. Moreover, compared to the
normally-trained DNN, the adversarially-trained DNN have more components which
mainly decrease the score of the true category. Above analyses provide new

characterize the distribution of pixel values in different image regions. We
describe a new approach for estimating appearance models directly from an
image, without explicit consideration of the pixels that make up each region.
Our approach is based on novel algebraic expressions that relate local image
statistics to the appearance of spatially coherent regions. We describe two
algorithms that can use the aforementioned algebraic expressions to estimate
appearance models directly from an image. The first algorithm solves a system
of linear and quadratic equations using a least squares formulation. The second
algorithm is a spectral method based on an eigenvector computation. We present
experimental results that demonstrate the proposed methods work well in
practice and lead to effective image segmentation algorithms.</span>

dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591K labeled frames. To
minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly
diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent
actions fall under the same label, e.g., &quot;Baseball Pitching&quot; vs &quot;Free Throw in
Basketball&quot;. Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets,
where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such
as &quot;Throw&quot;. HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement
of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label
noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a
high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high
scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3)
curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without
irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive
experiments including cross-data validation using datasets collected in the
wild demonstrate the clear benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics
of HAA500, which enable training even a baseline deep learning model to improve
prediction by attending to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset
statistics and collection methodology and compare quantitatively with existing
action recognition datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to classify samples under the
assumption that some classes are not observable during training. To bridge the
gap between the seen and unseen classes, most GZSL methods attempt to associate
the visual features of seen classes with attributes or to generate unseen
samples directly. Nevertheless, the visual features used in the prior
approaches do not necessarily encode semantically related information that the
shared attributes refer to, which degrades the model generalization to unseen
classes. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel semantics
disentangling framework for the generalized zero-shot learning task (SDGZSL),
where the visual features of unseen classes are firstly estimated by a
conditional VAE and then factorized into semantic-consistent and
semantic-unrelated latent vectors. In particular, a total correlation penalty
is applied to guarantee the independence between the two factorized
representations, and the semantic consistency of which is measured by the
derived relation network. Extensive experiments conducted on four GZSL
benchmark datasets have evidenced that the semantic-consistent features
disentangled by the proposed SDGZSL are more generalizable in tasks of
canonical and generalized zero-shot learning. Our source code is available at

the data privacy and security have drawn an increasing attention. Several
attempts have been made to alleviate the leakage of identity information from
face photos, with the aid of, e.g., image obfuscation techniques. However, most
of the present results are either perceptually unsatisfactory or ineffective
against face recognition systems. Our goal in this paper is to develop a
technique that can encrypt the personal photos such that they can protect users
from unauthorized face recognition systems but remain visually identical to the
original version for human beings. To achieve this, we propose a targeted
identity-protection iterative method (TIP-IM) to generate adversarial identity
masks which can be overlaid on facial images, such that the original identities
can be concealed without sacrificing the visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TIP-IM provides 95\%+ protection success rate against various
state-of-the-art face recognition models under practical test scenarios.
Besides, we also show the practical and effective applicability of our method
on a commercial API service.</span>

low cost and time efficiency. Although deep learning played a major role in the
recent success of acne detection, there are still several challenges such as
color shift by inconsistent illumination, variation in scales, and high density
distribution. To address these problems, we propose an acne detection network
which consists of three components, specifically: Composite Feature Refinement,
Dynamic Context Enhancement, and Mask-Aware Multi-Attention. First, Composite
Feature Refinement integrates semantic information and fine details to enrich
feature representation, which mitigates the adverse impact of imbalanced
illumination. Then, Dynamic Context Enhancement controls different receptive
fields of multi-scale features for context enhancement to handle scale
variation. Finally, Mask-Aware Multi-Attention detects densely arranged and
small acne by suppressing uninformative regions and highlighting probable acne
regions. Experiments are performed on acne image dataset ACNE04 and natural
image dataset PASCAL VOC 2007. We demonstrate how our method achieves the
state-of-the-art result on ACNE04 and competitive performance with previous
state-of-the-art methods on the PASCAL VOC 2007.</span>

                                        <span>Existing methods for arbitrary-shaped text detection in natural scenes face
two critical issues, i.e., 1) fracture detections at the gaps in a text
instance; and 2) inaccurate detections of arbitrary-shaped text instances with
diverse background context. To address these issues, we propose a novel method
named Intra- and Inter-Instance Collaborative Learning (I3CL). Specifically, to
address the first issue, we design an effective convolutional module with
multiple receptive fields, which is able to collaboratively learn better
character and gap feature representations at local and long ranges inside a
text instance. To address the second issue, we devise an instance-based
transformer module to exploit the dependencies between different text instances
and a global context module to exploit the semantic context from the shared
background, which are able to collaboratively learn more discriminative text
feature representation. In this way, I3CL can effectively exploit the intra-
and inter-instance dependencies together in a unified end-to-end trainable
framework. Besides, to make full use of the unlabeled data, we design an
effective semi-supervised learning method to leverage the pseudo labels via an
ensemble strategy. Without bells and whistles, experimental results show that
the proposed I3CL sets new state-of-the-art results on three challenging public
benchmarks, i.e., an F-measure of 77.5% on ICDAR2019-ArT, 86.9% on Total-Text,
and 86.4% on CTW-1500. Notably, our I3CL with the ResNeSt-101 backbone ranked
1st place on the ICDAR2019-ArT leaderboard. The source code will be made
publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>As Deep Neural Network models for face processing tasks approach human-like
performance, their deployment in critical applications such as law enforcement
and access control has seen an upswing, where any failure may have far-reaching
consequences. We need methods to build trust in deployed systems by making
their working as transparent as possible. Existing visualization algorithms are
designed for object recognition and do not give insightful results when applied
to the face domain. In this work, we present &#x27;Canonical Saliency Maps&#x27;, a new
method that highlights relevant facial areas by projecting saliency maps onto a
canonical face model. We present two kinds of Canonical Saliency Maps:
image-level maps and model-level maps. Image-level maps highlight facial
features responsible for the decision made by a deep face model on a given
image, thus helping to understand how a DNN made a prediction on the image.
Model-level maps provide an understanding of what the entire DNN model focuses
on in each task and thus can be used to detect biases in the model. Our
qualitative and quantitative results show the usefulness of the proposed
canonical saliency maps, which can be used on any deep face model regardless of
the architecture.</span>

                                        <span>High resolution images are widely used in our daily life, whereas high-speed
video capture is challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at
the high resolution mode. Digging deeper, the main bottleneck lies in the low
throughput of existing imaging systems. Towards this end, snapshot compressive
imaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of
imaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction.
During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a
single measurement. After this, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video
frames from the coded snapshot. Recently developed Plug-and-Play (PnP)
algorithms make it possible for SCI reconstruction in large-scale problems.
However, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI&#x27;s
wide application. In this paper, we build a novel hybrid coded aperture
snapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid
crystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement
a PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high quality
reconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we achieve
a 10-mega pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high
throughput of 4.6G voxels per second. Both simulation and real data experiments
verify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.</span>

                                        <span>Embedding learning (EL) and feature synthesizing (FS) are two of the popular
categories of fine-grained GZSL methods. EL or FS using global features cannot
discriminate fine details in the absence of local features. On the other hand,
EL or FS methods exploiting local features either neglect direct attribute
guidance or global information. Consequently, neither method performs well. In
this paper, we propose to explore global and direct attribute-supervised local
visual features for both EL and FS categories in an integrated manner for
fine-grained GZSL. The proposed integrated network has an EL sub-network and a
FS sub-network. Consequently, the proposed integrated network can be tested in
two ways. We propose a novel two-step dense attention mechanism to discover
attribute-guided local visual features. We introduce new mutual learning
between the sub-networks to exploit mutually beneficial information for
optimization. Moreover, we propose to compute source-target class similarity
based on mutual information and transfer-learn the target classes to reduce
bias towards the source domain during testing. We demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms contemporary methods on benchmark datasets.</span>

self-attention as the basic block to construct our network: SepNet. Our
proposed module can effectively capture both local and global dependencies.
This module computes the features of a group based on the summation of the
weighted features of any point within the group. For convenience, we generalize
groupwise operations to assemble this module. To further facilitate our
networks, we deepen and widen SepNet on the tasks of segmentation and
classification respectively, and verify its practicality. Specifically, SepNet
achieves state-of-the-art for the tasks of classification and segmentation on
most of the datasets. We show empirical evidence that SepNet can obtain extra
accuracy in classification or segmentation from increased width or depth,
respectively.</span>

algorithms, a large-scale High-Fidelity Mask dataset, namely CASIA-SURF
HiFiMask (briefly HiFiMask) has been collected. Specifically, it consists of a
total amount of 54, 600 videos which are recorded from 75 subjects with 225
realistic masks under 7 new kinds of sensors. Based on this dataset and
Protocol 3 which evaluates both the discrimination and generalization ability
of the algorithm under the open set scenarios, we organized a 3D High-Fidelity
Mask Face Presentation Attack Detection Challenge to boost the research of 3D
mask-based attack detection. It attracted 195 teams for the development phase
with a total of 18 teams qualifying for the final round. All the results were
verified and re-run by the organizing team, and the results were used for the
final ranking. This paper presents an overview of the challenge, including the
introduction of the dataset used, the definition of the protocol, the
calculation of the evaluation criteria, and the summary and publication of the

point-wise features via the trilinear interpolation. For fine-grained 3D vision
tasks where point-wise features are essential, like semantic segmentation and

networks towards adversarial perturbations, especially on the classification
task. The effect of this type of training on semantic segmentation, contrarily,
just commences. We make the initial attempt to explore the defense strategy on
semantic segmentation by formulating a general adversarial training procedure
that can perform decently on both adversarial and clean samples. We propose a
dynamic divide-and-conquer adversarial training (DDC-AT) strategy to enhance
the defense effect, by setting additional branches in the target model during
training, and dealing with pixels with diverse properties towards adversarial
perturbation. Our dynamical division mechanism divides pixels into multiple
branches automatically. Note all these additional branches can be abandoned
during inference and thus leave no extra parameter and computation cost.
Extensive experiments with various segmentation models are conducted on PASCAL
VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, in which DDC-AT yields satisfying performance
under both white- and black-box attack.</span>

(CPath), especially with the help of deep neural networks. However, the network
performance is highly related to architecture design, which commonly requires
human experts with domain knowledge. In this paper, we combat this challenge
with the recent advance in neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal
network for CPath applications. In particular, we use differentiable
architecture search (DARTS) for its efficiency. We first adopt a probing metric
to show that the original DARTS lacks proper hyperparameter tuning on the CIFAR
dataset, and how the generalization issue can be addressed using an adaptive
optimization strategy. We then apply our searching framework on CPath
applications by searching for the optimum network architecture on a
histological tissue type dataset (ADP). Results show that the searched network
outperforms state-of-the-art networks in terms of prediction accuracy and
computation complexity. We further conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate
the transferability of the searched network to new CPath applications, the
robustness against downscaled inputs, as well as the reliability of
predictions.</span>

years due to its extensive applications in video surveillance. While deep
learning-based methods have led to significant progress, these methods are
limited by ineffectively using complementary information, which is blamed on
necessary data augmentation in the training process. Data augmentation has been
widely used to mitigate the over-fitting trap and improve the ability of
network representation. However, the previous methods adopt image-based data
augmentation scheme to individually process the input frames, which corrupts
the complementary information between consecutive frames and causes performance
degradation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that

                                        <span>Most polyp segmentation methods use CNNs as their backbone, leading to two
key issues when exchanging information between the encoder and decoder: 1)
taking into account the differences in contribution between different-level
features; and 2) designing effective mechanism for fusing these features.
Different from existing CNN-based methods, we adopt a transformer encoder,
which learns more powerful and robust representations. In addition, considering
the image acquisition influence and elusive properties of polyps, we introduce
three novel modules, including a cascaded fusion module (CFM), a camouflage
identification module (CIM), a and similarity aggregation module (SAM). Among
these, the CFM is used to collect the semantic and location information of
polyps from high-level features, while the CIM is applied to capture polyp
information disguised in low-level features. With the help of the SAM, we
extend the pixel features of the polyp area with high-level semantic position
information to the entire polyp area, thereby effectively fusing cross-level
features. The proposed model, named \ourmodel, effectively suppresses noises in
the features and significantly improves their expressive capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely adopted datasets show that the proposed
model is more robust to various challenging situations (e.g., appearance
changes, small objects) than existing methods, and achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance. The proposed model is available at

                                        <span>We address the problem of network quantization, that is, reducing bit-widths
of weights and/or activations to lighten network architectures. Quantization
methods use a rounding function to map full-precision values to the nearest
quantized ones, but this operation is not differentiable. There are mainly two
approaches to training quantized networks with gradient-based optimizers.
First, a straight-through estimator (STE) replaces the zero derivative of the
rounding with that of an identity function, which causes a gradient mismatch
problem. Second, soft quantizers approximate the rounding with continuous
functions at training time, and exploit the rounding for quantization at test
time. This alleviates the gradient mismatch, but causes a quantizer gap
problem. We alleviate both problems in a unified framework. To this end, we
introduce a novel quantizer, dubbed a distance-aware quantizer (DAQ), that
mainly consists of a distance-aware soft rounding (DASR) and a temperature
controller. To alleviate the gradient mismatch problem, DASR approximates the
discrete rounding with the kernel soft argmax, which is based on our insight
that the quantization can be formulated as a distance-based assignment problem
between full-precision values and quantized ones. The controller adjusts the
temperature parameter in DASR adaptively according to the input, addressing the
quantizer gap problem. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that
DAQ outperforms the state of the art significantly for various bit-widths
without bells and whistles.</span>

                                        <span>Brain lesion segmentation provides a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis,
and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in
the task. Data augmentation is a widely used strategy that improves the
training of CNNs, and the design of the augmentation method for brain lesion
segmentation is still an open problem. In this work, we propose a simple data
augmentation approach, dubbed as CarveMix, for CNN-based brain lesion
segmentation. Like other &quot;mix&quot;-based methods, such as Mixup and CutMix,
CarveMix stochastically combines two existing labeled images to generate new
labeled samples. Yet, unlike these augmentation strategies based on image
combination, CarveMix is lesion-aware, where the combination is performed with
an attention on the lesions and a proper annotation is created for the
generated image. Specifically, from one labeled image we carve a region of
interest (ROI) according to the lesion location and geometry, and the size of
the ROI is sampled from a probability distribution. The carved ROI then
replaces the corresponding voxels in a second labeled image, and the annotation
of the second image is replaced accordingly as well. In this way, we generate
new labeled images for network training and the lesion information is
preserved. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on two
brain lesion datasets. The results show that our method improves the
segmentation accuracy compared with other simple data augmentation approaches.</span>

                                        <span>To improve the generalization of detectors, for domain adaptive object
detection (DAOD), recent advances mainly explore aligning feature-level
distributions between the source and single-target domain, which may neglect
the impact of domain-specific information existing in the aligned features.
Towards DAOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant object
representations. To this end, in this paper, we try to disentangle
domain-invariant representations from domain-specific representations. And we
propose a novel disentangled method based on vector decomposition. Firstly, an
extractor is devised to separate domain-invariant representations from the
input, which are used for extracting object proposals. Secondly,
domain-specific representations are introduced as the differences between the
input and domain-invariant representations. Through the difference operation,
the gap between the domain-specific and domain-invariant representations is
enlarged, which promotes domain-invariant representations to contain more
domain-irrelevant information. In the experiment, we separately evaluate our
method on the single- and compound-target case. For the single-target case,
experimental results of four domain-shift scenes show our method obtains a
significant performance gain over baseline methods. Moreover, for the
compound-target case (i.e., the target is a compound of two different domains
without domain labels), our method outperforms baseline methods by around 4%,
which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.</span>

However, \textit{can seemingly unbiased pre-trained model become biased when
input data undergoes certain distortions?} For the first time, we attempt to
answer this question in the context of face recognition. We provide a

understandability and generalization ability, it is important to develop
representative interpretations that interpret common decision logics of a CNN
on a large group of similar images, which reveal the common semantics data
contributes to many closely related predictions. In this paper, we develop a
novel unsupervised approach to produce a highly representative interpretation
for a large number of similar images. We formulate the problem of finding
representative interpretations as a co-clustering problem, and convert it into
a submodular cost submodular cover problem based on a sample of the linear
decision boundaries of a CNN. We also present a visualization and similarity
ranking method. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent performance
of our method.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate detection and segmentation of marine debris is important for keeping
the water bodies clean. This paper presents a novel dataset for marine debris
segmentation collected using a Forward Looking Sonar (FLS). The dataset
consists of 1868 FLS images captured using ARIS Explorer 3000 sensor. The
objects used to produce this dataset contain typical house-hold marine debris
and distractor marine objects (tires, hooks, valves,etc), divided in 11 classes
plus a background class. Performance of state of the art semantic segmentation
architectures with a variety of encoders have been analyzed on this dataset and
presented as baseline results. Since the images are grayscale, no pretrained
weights have been used. Comparisons are made using Intersection over Union
(IoU). The best performing model is Unet with ResNet34 backbone at 0.7481 mIoU.

                                        <span>Event camera is an emerging imaging sensor for capturing dynamics of moving
objects as events, which motivates our work in estimating 3D human pose and
shape from the event signals. Events, on the other hand, have their unique
challenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are
best at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep
learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by
unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and
optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input
to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate
the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow
(vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is
introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the
identical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated
that comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one
to our knowledge. Empirical evaluations on DHP19 dataset and our in-house
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</span>

unlabeled image collections. Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn
useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each
input image or by speculatively picking negative samples, we instead also make
use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured
using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available
context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal
relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations
that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by
first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those
images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task
of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be
adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human
supervision. We present results on four different camera trap image
collections, across three different families of self-supervised learning
methods, and show that careful image selection at training time results in
superior performance compared to existing baselines such as conventional
self-supervised training and transfer learning.</span>

semantic segmentation in presence of multiple target domains: The objective is
to train a single model that can handle all these domains at test time. Such a
multi-target adaptation is crucial for a variety of scenarios that real-world
autonomous systems must handle. It is a challenging setup since one faces not
only the domain gap between the labeled source set and the unlabeled target
set, but also the distribution shifts existing within the latter among the
different target domains. To this end, we introduce two adversarial frameworks:
(i) multi-discriminator, which explicitly aligns each target domain to its
counterparts, and (ii) multi-target knowledge transfer, which learns a
target-agnostic model thanks to a multi-teacher/single-student distillation
mechanism.The evaluation is done on four newly-proposed multi-target benchmarks
for UDA in semantic segmentation. In all tested scenarios, our approaches
consistently outperform baselines, setting competitive standards for the novel
task.</span>

                                        <span>Image harmonization aims to improve the quality of image compositing by
matching the &quot;appearance&quot; (\eg, color tone, brightness and contrast) between
foreground and background images. However, collecting large-scale annotated
datasets for this task requires complex professional retouching. Instead, we
propose a novel Self-Supervised Harmonization framework (SSH) that can be
trained using just &quot;free&quot; natural images without being edited. We reformulate
the image harmonization problem from a representation fusion perspective, which
separately processes the foreground and background examples, to address the
background occlusion issue. This framework design allows for a dual data
augmentation method, where diverse [foreground, background, pseudo GT] triplets
can be generated by cropping an image with perturbations using 3D color lookup
tables (LUTs). In addition, we build a real-world harmonization dataset as
carefully created by expert users, for evaluation and benchmarking purposes.
Our results show that the proposed self-supervised method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in terms of reference metrics, visual quality, and
subject user study. Code and dataset are available at

                                        <span>Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) aims to learn generic multimodal
representations from massive image-text pairs. While various successful
attempts have been proposed, learning fine-grained semantic alignments between
image-text pairs plays a key role in their approaches. Nevertheless, most
existing VLP approaches have not fully utilized the intrinsic knowledge within
the image-text pairs, which limits the effectiveness of the learned alignments
and further restricts the performance of their models. To this end, we
introduce a new VLP method called ROSITA, which integrates the cross- and
intra-modal knowledge in a unified scene graph to enhance the semantic
alignments. Specifically, we introduce a novel structural knowledge masking
(SKM) strategy to use the scene graph structure as a priori to perform masked
language (region) modeling, which enhances the semantic alignments by
eliminating the interference information within and across modalities.
Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive analysis verifies the
effectiveness of ROSITA in semantic alignments. Pretrained with both in-domain
and out-of-domain datasets, ROSITA significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art VLP methods on three typical vision-and-language tasks over
six benchmark datasets.</span>

integrates Flow reconstruction and Frame prediction seamlessly to handle Video
Anomaly Detection. Firstly, we design the network of ML-MemAE-SC (Multi-Level
Memory modules in an Autoencoder with Skip Connections) to memorize normal
patterns for optical flow reconstruction so that abnormal events can be
sensitively identified with larger flow reconstruction errors. More
importantly, conditioned on the reconstructed flows, we then employ a
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which captures the high correlation
between video frame and optical flow, to predict the next frame given several
previous frames. By CVAE, the quality of flow reconstruction essentially
influences that of frame prediction. Therefore, poorly reconstructed optical
flows of abnormal events further deteriorate the quality of the final predicted
future frame, making the anomalies more detectable. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

                                        <span>This work presents an unsupervised deep learning scheme that exploiting
high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image
restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in
score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of
data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The
channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale
transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of
high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train
the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by
annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update.
Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional
representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance.
The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which
involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and
clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental
results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and
diversity of our proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate and timely estimation of precipitation is critical for issuing
hazard warnings (e.g., for flash floods or landslides). Current remotely sensed
precipitation products have a few hours of latency, associated with the
acquisition and processing of satellite data. By applying a robust nowcasting
system to these products, it is (in principle) possible to reduce this latency
and improve their applicability, value, and impact. However, the development of
such a system is complicated by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, and the
consequent rapid changes that can occur in the structures of precipitation
systems In this work, we develop two approaches (hereafter referred to as
Nowcasting-Nets) that use Recurrent and Convolutional deep neural network
structures to address the challenge of precipitation nowcasting. A total of
five models are trained using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated
Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data over the Eastern
Contiguous United States (CONUS) and then tested against independent data for
the Eastern and Western CONUS. The models were designed to provide forecasts
with a lead time of up to 1.5 hours and, by using a feedback loop approach, the
ability of the models to extend the forecast time to 4.5 hours was also
investigated. Model performance was compared against the Random Forest (RF) and
Linear Regression (LR) machine learning methods, and also against a persistence
benchmark (BM) that used the most recent observation as the forecast.
Independent IMERG observations were used as a reference, and experiments were
conducted to examine both overall statistics and case studies involving
specific precipitation events. Overall, the forecasts provided by the
Nowcasting-Net models are superior, with the Convolutional Nowcasting Network
with Residual Head (CNC-R) achieving 25%, 28%, and 46% improvement in the test

                                        <span>Over the past few years, the success in action recognition on short trimmed
videos has led more investigations towards the temporal segmentation of actions
in untrimmed long videos. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved
excellent performance in segmenting complex human actions in untrimmed videos.
However, besides action labels, such approaches also require the start and end
points of each action, which is expensive and tedious to collect.

In this paper, we aim to learn the action segments taking only the high-level
activity labels as input. Under the setting where no action-level supervision
is provided, Hungarian matching is often used to find the mapping between
segments and ground truth actions to evaluate the model and report the
performance. On the one hand, we show that with the high-level supervision, we
are able to generalize the Hungarian matching settings from the current video
and activity level to the global level. The extended global-level matching
allows for the shared actions across activities. On the other hand, we propose
a novel action discovery framework that automatically discovers constituent
actions in videos with the activity classification task. Specifically, we
define a finite number of prototypes to form a dual representation of a video
sequence. These collectively learned prototypes are considered discovered
actions. This classification setting endows our approach the capability of
discovering potentially shared actions across multiple complex activities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the discovered actions are helpful in
performing temporal action segmentation and activity recognition.</span>

                                        <span>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have witnessed prevailing success in
yielding outstanding images, however, they are burdensome to deploy on
resource-constrained devices due to ponderous computational costs and hulking
memory usage. Although recent efforts on compressing GANs have acquired
remarkable results, they still exist potential model redundancies and can be
further compressed. To solve this issue, we propose a novel online
multi-granularity distillation (OMGD) scheme to obtain lightweight GANs, which
contributes to generating high-fidelity images with low computational demands.
We offer the first attempt to popularize single-stage online distillation for
GAN-oriented compression, where the progressively promoted teacher generator
helps to refine the discriminator-free based student generator. Complementary
teacher generators and network layers provide comprehensive and
multi-granularity concepts to enhance visual fidelity from diverse dimensions.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMGD successes
to compress 40x MACs and 82.5X parameters on Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, without loss
of image quality. It reveals that OMGD provides a feasible solution for the
deployment of real-time image translation on resource-constrained devices. Our
code and models are made public at: https://github.com/bytedance/OMGD.</span>

yet important properties for black-box adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
explore effective mechanisms to boost both of them from the perspective of
network hierarchy, where a typical network can be hierarchically divided into
output stage, intermediate stage and input stage. Since over-specialization of
source model, we can hardly improve the transferability and robustness of the
adversarial perturbations in the output stage. Therefore, we focus on the
intermediate and input stages in this paper and propose a transferable and
robust adversarial perturbation generation (TRAP) method. Specifically, we
propose the dynamically guided mechanism to continuously calculate accurate
directional guidances for perturbation generation in the intermediate stage. In
the input stage, instead of the single-form transformation augmentations
adopted in the existing methods, we leverage multiform affine transformation
augmentations to further enrich the input diversity and boost the robustness
and transferability of the adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our TRAP achieves impressive transferability and high
robustness against certain interferences.</span>

work, we propose a Deep Adversarially-Enhanced k-Nearest Neighbors (DAEkNN)

DAEkNN is based on an adversarially trained model. Second, DAEkNN makes
predictions by leveraging a weighted combination of benign and adversarial

Pedestrian attribute, such as gender, age and clothing characteristics contains
rich and supplementary information but is less explored in video person Re-ID.
In this work, we propose a novel network architecture named Attribute Salience
Assisted Network (ASA-Net) for attribute-assisted video person Re-ID, which
achieved considerable improvement to existing works by two methods.First, to
learn a better separation of the target from background, we propose to learn
the visual attention from middle-level attribute instead of high-level
identities. The proposed Attribute Salient Region Enhance (ASRE) module can
attend more accurately on the body of pedestrian. Second, we found that many
identity-irrelevant but object or subject-relevant factors like the view angle
and movement of the target pedestrian can greatly influence the two dimensional
appearance of a pedestrian. This problem can be mitigated by investigating both
identity-relevant and identity-irrelevant attributes via a novel triplet loss

                                        <span>Registration of 3D anatomic structures to their 2D dual fluoroscopic X-ray
images is a widely used motion tracking technique. However, deep learning
implementation is often impeded by a paucity of medical images and ground
truths. In this study, we proposed a transfer learning strategy for 3D-to-2D
registration using deep neural networks trained from an artificial dataset.
Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) and radiographic skull landmarks
were automatically created from craniocervical CT data of a female subject.
They were used to train a residual network (ResNet) for landmark detection and
a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to eliminate the style difference
between DRRs and actual X-rays. Landmarks on the X-rays experiencing GAN style
translation were detected by the ResNet, and were used in triangulation
optimization for 3D-to-2D registration of the skull in actual dual-fluoroscope
images (with a non-orthogonal setup, point X-ray sources, image distortions,
and partially captured skull regions). The registration accuracy was evaluated
in multiple scenarios of craniocervical motions. In walking, learning-based
registration for the skull had angular/position errors of 3.9 +- 2.1 deg / 4.6
+- 2.2 mm. However, the accuracy was lower during functional neck activity, due
to overly small skull regions imaged on the dual fluoroscopic images at
end-range positions. The methodology to strategically augment artificial
training data can tackle the complicated skull registration scenario, and has
potentials to extend to widespread registration scenarios.</span>

have tremendous potential for fast autonomous or remote-controlled semantic
scene analysis, e.g., for disaster examination. In this work, we propose a UAV
system for real-time semantic inference and fusion of multiple sensor
modalities. Semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans and RGB images, as well as
object detection on RGB and thermal images, run online onboard the UAV computer
using lightweight CNN architectures and embedded inference accelerators. We
follow a late fusion approach where semantic information from multiple
modalities augments 3D point clouds and image segmentation masks while also
generating an allocentric semantic map. Our system provides augmented semantic
images and point clouds with $\approx\,$9$\,$Hz. We evaluate the integrated
system in real-world experiments in an urban environment.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot semantic segmentation is a challenging task of predicting object
categories in pixel-wise with only few annotated samples. However, existing
approaches still face two main challenges. First, huge feature distinction
between support and query images causes knowledge transferring barrier, which
harms the segmentation performance. Second, few support samples cause
unrepresentative of support features, hardly to guide high-quality query
segmentation. To deal with the above two issues, we propose self-distillation
embedded supervised affinity attention model (SD-AANet) to improve the
performance of few-shot segmentation task. Specifically, the self-distillation
guided prototype module (SDPM) extracts intrinsic prototype by
self-distillation between support and query to capture representative features.
The supervised affinity attention module (SAAM) adopts support ground truth to
guide the production of high quality query attention map, which can learn
affinity information to focus on whole area of query target. Extensive
experiments prove that our SD-AANet significantly improves the performance
comparing with existing methods. Comprehensive ablation experiments and
visualization studies also show the significant effect of SDPM and SAAM for
few-shot segmentation task. On benchmark datasets, PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i, our
proposed SD-AANet both achieve state-of-the-art results. Our code will be
publicly available soon.</span>

                                        <span>Several studies have identified discrepancies between the popularity of items
in user profiles and the corresponding recommendation lists. Such behavior,
which concerns a variety of recommendation algorithms, is referred to as
popularity bias. Existing work predominantly adopts simple statistical
measures, such as the difference of mean or median popularity, to quantify
popularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics
other than the inclination to popular content. In this work, in contrast, we
propose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and
recommendation list) in terms of median, a variety of statistical moments, as
well as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions
(Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kendall&#x27;s tau rank-order correlation). This
results in a more detailed picture of the characteristics of popularity bias.
Furthermore, we investigate whether such algorithmic popularity bias affects
users of different genders in the same way. We focus on music recommendation
and conduct experiments on the recently released standardized LFM-2b dataset,
containing listening profiles of Last.fm users. We investigate the algorithmic
popularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative
filtering and two baselines). Our experiments show that (1) the studied metrics
provide novel insights into popularity bias in comparison with only using
average differences, (2) algorithms less inclined towards popularity bias
amplification do not necessarily perform worse in terms of utility (NDCG), (3)
the majority of the investigated recommenders intensify the popularity bias of
the female users.</span>

                                        <span>Hashing technology has been widely used in image retrieval due to its
computational and storage efficiency. Recently, deep unsupervised hashing
methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human
annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology.
However, most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a
similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature
space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in
which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is
confronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is
inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot
explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may
be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the
aforementioned problems, we propose a \textbf{Deep Self-Adaptive
Hashing~(DSAH)} model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two
special designs: \textbf{Adaptive Neighbor Discovery~(AND)} and
\textbf{Pairwise Information Content~(PIC)}. Firstly, we adopt the AND to
initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix, and then refine
this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further
investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly,
we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to
them, which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain
more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies
facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance in a
self-adaptive manner.</span>

relevance of the recommendation system. Diversity, a crucial factor which
measures the dissimilarity among the recommended items, received rather little
scrutiny. Directly related to user satisfaction, diversification is usually
taken into consideration after generating the candidate items. However, this
decoupled design of diversification and candidate generation makes the whole
system suboptimal. In this paper, we aim at pushing the diversification to the
upstream candidate generation stage, with the help of Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCN). Although GCN based recommendation algorithms have shown great
power in modeling complex collaborative filtering effect to improve the
accuracy of recommendation, how diversity changes is ignored in those advanced
works. We propose to perform rebalanced neighbor discovering, category-boosted
negative sampling and adversarial learning on top of GCN. We conduct extensive
experiments on real-world datasets. Experimental results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method on diversification. Further ablation
studies validate that our proposed method significantly alleviates the
accuracy-diversity dilemma.</span>

(EHR) systems it is important for these organisations to maximise the secondary
use of their data to support service improvement and clinical research. These
organisations will find it challenging to have systems which can mine
information from the unstructured data fields in the record (clinical notes,
letters etc) and more practically have such systems interact with all of the
hospitals data systems (legacy and current). To tackle this problem at
University College London Hospitals, we have deployed an enhanced version of
the CogStack platform; an information retrieval platform with natural language
processing capabilities which we have configured to process the hospital&#x27;s
existing and legacy records. The platform has improved data ingestion
capabilities as well as better tools for natural language processing. To date
we have processed over 18 million records and the insights produced from
CogStack have informed a number of clinical research use cases at the
hospitals.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic text matching is a critical problem in information retrieval.
Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used in this area and
obtained significant performance improvements. However, most models are black
boxes and it is hard to understand what happened in the matching process, due
to the poor interpretability of deep learning. This paper aims at tackling this
problem. The key idea is to test whether existing deep text matching methods
satisfy some fundamental heuristics in information retrieval. Specifically,
four heuristics are used in our study, i.e., term frequency constraint, term
discrimination constraint, length normalization constraints, and TF-length
constraint. Since deep matching models usually contain many parameters, it is
difficult to conduct a theoretical study for these complicated functions. In
this paper, We propose an empirical testing method. Specifically, We first
construct some queries and documents to make them satisfy the assumption in a
constraint, and then test to which extend a deep text matching model trained on
the original dataset satisfies the corresponding constraint. Besides, a famous
attribution based interpretation method, namely integrated gradient, is adopted
to conduct detailed analysis and guide for feasible improvement. Experimental
results on LETOR 4.0 and MS Marco show that all the investigated deep text
matching methods, both representation and interaction based methods, satisfy
the above constraints with high probabilities in statistics. We further extend
these constraints to the semantic settings, which are shown to be better
satisfied for all the deep text matching models. These empirical findings give
clear understandings on why deep text matching models usually perform well in
information retrieval. We believe the proposed evaluation methodology will be
useful for testing future deep text matching models.</span>

                                        <span>Modeling inter-dependencies between time-series is the key to achieve high
performance in anomaly detection for multivariate time-series data. The
de-facto solution to model the dependencies is to feed the data into a
recurrent neural network (RNN). However, the fully connected network structure
underneath the RNN (either GRU or LSTM) assumes a static and complete
dependency graph between time-series, which may not hold in many real-world
applications. To alleviate this assumption, we propose a dynamic bipartite
graph structure to encode the inter-dependencies between time-series. More
concretely, we model time series as one type of nodes, and the time series
segments (regarded as event) as another type of nodes, where the edge between
two types of nodes describe a temporal pattern occurred on a specific time
series at a certain time. Based on this design, relations between time series
can be explicitly modelled via dynamic connections to event nodes, and the
multivariate time-series anomaly detection problem can be formulated as a
self-supervised, edge stream prediction problem in dynamic graphs. We conducted
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design.</span>

                                        <span>The newly emerged transformer technology has a tremendous impact on NLP
research. In the general English domain, transformer-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on various NLP benchmarks. In the clinical
domain, researchers also have investigated transformer models for clinical
applications. The goal of this study is to systematically explore three widely
used transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) for clinical
relation extraction and develop an open-source package with clinical
pre-trained transformer-based models to facilitate information extraction in
the clinical domain. We developed a series of clinical RE models based on three
transformer architectures, namely BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We evaluated these
models using 2 publicly available datasets from 2018 MADE1.0 and 2018 n2c2
challenges. We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class
classification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations
in different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three
transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We
demonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance
on the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958. On the 2018 n2c2
dataset, the XLNet-clinical model achieved the best F1-score of 0.9610. Our
results indicated that the binary classification strategy consistently
outperformed the multi-class classification strategy for clinical relation
extraction. Our methods and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerRelationExtraction.
We believe this work will improve current practice on clinical relation
extraction and other related NLP tasks in the biomedical domain.</span>

modeling user behavior and preferences using short-term anonymous sessions.
Existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate and
aggregate information from neighboring nodes i.e., local message passing. Such
graph-based architectures have representational limits, as a single sub-graph
is susceptible to overfit the sequential dependencies instead of accounting for
complex transitions between items in different sessions. We propose using a

Representation Learning. Our experimental results and ablation show that our

                                        <span>In order to model the evolution of user preference, we should learn user/item
embeddings based on time-ordered item purchasing sequences, which is defined as
Sequential Recommendation (SR) problem. Existing methods leverage sequential
patterns to model item transitions. However, most of them ignore crucial
temporal collaborative signals, which are latent in evolving user-item
interactions and coexist with sequential patterns. Therefore, we propose to
unify sequential patterns and temporal collaborative signals to improve the
quality of recommendation, which is rather challenging. Firstly, it is hard to
simultaneously encode sequential patterns and collaborative signals. Secondly,
it is non-trivial to express the temporal effects of collaborative signals.

Hence, we design a new framework Temporal Graph Sequential Recommender
(TGSRec) upon our defined continuous-time bi-partite graph. We propose a novel
Temporal Collaborative Trans-former (TCT) layer in TGSRec, which advances the
self-attention mechanism by adopting a novel collaborative attention. TCT layer
can simultaneously capture collaborative signals from both users and items, as
well as considering temporal dynamics inside sequential patterns. We propagate
the information learned fromTCTlayerover the temporal graph to unify sequential
patterns and temporal collaborative signals. Empirical results on five datasets
show that TGSRec significantly outperforms other baselines, in average up to
22.5% and 22.1%absolute improvements in Recall@10and MRR, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Aiming to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional
recommender systems, incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement
auxiliary information has recently gained considerable attention. Via unifying
the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works
explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of
users and items with rich semantics. However, these real-world tripartite
graphs are usually scale-free, the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures of
which are underemphasized in existing works, consequently, leading to
suboptimal recommendation performance.

To address this issue and provide more accurate recommendation, we propose a
knowledge-aware recommendation method with the hyperbolic geometry, namely
Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation
(LKGR). LKGR facilitates better modeling of scale-free tripartite graphs after
the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation
strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous
information from historical interactions and KGs. Our proposed knowledge-aware
attention mechanism enables the model to automatically measure the information
contribution, producing the coherent information aggregation in the hyperbolic
space. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
LKGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.2-29.9% of Recall@20 on Top-K
recommendation.</span>

                                        <span>Tables are often created with hierarchies, but existing works on table
reasoning mainly focus on flat tables and neglect hierarchical tables.
Hierarchical tables challenge existing methods by hierarchical indexing, as
well as implicit relationships of calculation and semantics. This work presents
HiTab, a free and open dataset for the research community to study question
answering (QA) and natural language generation (NLG) over hierarchical tables.
HiTab is a cross-domain dataset constructed from a wealth of statistical
reports and Wikipedia pages, and has unique characteristics: (1) nearly all
tables are hierarchical, and (2) both target sentences for NLG and questions
for QA are revised from high-quality descriptions in statistical reports that
are meaningful and diverse. (3) HiTab provides fine-grained annotations on both
entity and quantity alignment. Targeting hierarchical structure, we devise a
novel hierarchy-aware logical form for symbolic reasoning over tables, which
shows high effectiveness. Then given annotations of entity and quantity
alignment, we propose partially supervised training, which helps models to
largely reduce spurious predictions in the QA task. In the NLG task, we find
that entity and quantity alignment also helps NLG models to generate better
results in a conditional generation setting. Experiment results of
state-of-the-art baselines suggest that this dataset presents a strong
challenge and a valuable benchmark for future research.</span>

                                        <span>Sequential Recommendationdescribes a set of techniques to model dynamic user
behavior in order to predict future interactions in sequential user data. At
their core, such approaches model transition probabilities between items in a
sequence, whether through Markov chains, recurrent networks, or more recently,
Transformers. However both old and new issues remain, including data-sparsity
and noisy data; such issues can impair the performance, especially in complex,
parameter-hungry models. In this paper, we investigate the application of
contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to the sequential recommendation, as
a way to alleviate some of these issues. Contrastive SSL constructs
augmentations from unlabelled instances, where agreements among positive pairs
are maximized. It is challenging to devise a contrastive SSL framework for a
sequential recommendation, due to its discrete nature, correlations among
items, and skewness of length distributions. To this end, we propose a novel
framework, Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for sequential Recommendation
(CoSeRec). We introduce two informative augmentation operators leveraging item
correlations to create high-quality views for contrastive learning.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method on improving model performance and the robustness
against sparse and noisy data. Our implementation is available online at

and offer multiple enhancements. Nevertheless, many companies are unaware that
these data can be used efficiently to improve their own operation. This is
where the Enterprise Architecture Framework comes in. It empowers an
organisation to get a clear view of their business, application, technical and
physical layer. This modelling approach is an established method for
organizations to take a deeper look into their structure and processes. The
development of such models requires a great deal of effort, is carried out
manually by interviewing stakeholders and requires continuous maintenance. Our
new approach enables the automated mining of Enterprise Architecture models.
The system uses common technologies to collect the metadata based on network
traffic, log files and other information in an organisation. Based on this, the
new approach generates EA models with the desired views points. Furthermore, a
rule and knowledge-based reasoning is used to obtain a holistic overview. This
offers a strategic decision support from business structure over process design
up to planning the appropriate support technology. Therefore, it forms the base
for organisations to act in an agile way. The modelling can be performed in
different modelling languages, including ArchiMate and the Nato Architecture
Framework (NAF). The designed approach is already evaluated on a small company
with multiple services and an infrastructure with several nodes.</span>

from effective team management to match win predictions use some form of
analytics. Meaningful data representations are necessary for efficient analysis
of data. In this study we investigate the use of adaptive (learnable)
embeddings to represent inter-related features (such as players, teams, etc).
The data used for this study is collected from a classical T20 tournament IPL
(Indian Premier League). To naturally facilitate the learning of meaningful
representations of features for accurate data analysis, we formulate a deep
representation learning framework which jointly learns a custom set of
embeddings (which represents our features of interest) through the minimization
of a contrastive loss. We base our objective on a set of classes obtained as a
result of hierarchical clustering on the overall run rate of an innings. It&#x27;s
been assessed that the framework ensures greater generality in the obtained
embeddings, on top of which a task based analysis of overall run rate
prediction was done to show the reliability of the framework.</span>

In particular, current practice constructs attack graphs exclusively using the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and its components. We present
methods for constructing attack graphs using notions from IPB on cyber terrain
analysis of obstacles, avenues of approach, key terrain, observation and fields

                                        <span>We consider incentivized exploration: a version of multi-armed bandits where
the choice of arms is controlled by self-interested agents, and the algorithm
can only issue recommendations. The algorithm controls the flow of information,
and the information asymmetry can incentivize the agents to explore. Prior work
achieves optimal regret rates up to multiplicative factors that become
arbitrarily large depending on the Bayesian priors, and scale exponentially in
the number of arms. A more basic problem of sampling each arm once runs into
similar factors.

We focus on the price of incentives: the loss in performance, broadly
construed, incurred for the sake of incentive-compatibility. We prove that
Thompson Sampling, a standard bandit algorithm, is incentive-compatible if
initialized with sufficiently many data points. The performance loss due to
incentives is therefore limited to the initial rounds when these data points
are collected. The problem is largely reduced to that of sample complexity: how
many rounds are needed? We address this question, providing matching upper and
lower bounds and instantiating them in various corollaries. Typically, the
optimal sample complexity is polynomial in the number of arms and exponential
in the &quot;strength of beliefs&quot;.</span>

                                        <span>Real-world recommender system needs to be regularly retrained to keep with
the new data. In this work, we consider how to efficiently retrain graph
convolution network (GCN) based recommender models, which are state-of-the-art
techniques for collaborative recommendation. To pursue high efficiency, we set
the target as using only new data for model updating, meanwhile not sacrificing
the recommendation accuracy compared with full model retraining. This is
non-trivial to achieve, since the interaction data participates in both the
graph structure for model construction and the loss function for model
learning, whereas the old graph structure is not allowed to use in model
updating. Towards the goal, we propose a \textit{Causal Incremental Graph
Convolution} approach, which consists of two new operators named
\textit{Incremental Graph Convolution} (IGC) and \textit{Colliding Effect
Distillation} (CED) to estimate the output of full graph convolution. In
particular, we devise simple and effective modules for IGC to ingeniously
combine the old representations and the incremental graph and effectively fuse
the long-term and short-term preference signals. CED aims to avoid the
out-of-date issue of inactive nodes that are not in the incremental graph,
which connects the new data with inactive nodes through causal inference. In
particular, CED estimates the causal effect of new data on the representation
of inactive nodes through the control of their collider. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets demonstrate both accuracy gains and significant
speed-ups over the existing retraining mechanism.</span>

contextual representation learning such as BERTology, building a decent
misspelling detector without having to rely on hand-crafted features associated
with noisy-channel architecture becomes more-than-ever accessible. However
BERTolgy models are trained with natural language corpus but Maps Search is
highly domain specific, would BERTology continue its success. In this paper we
design 4 stages of models for misspeling detection ranging from the most basic
LSTM to single-domain augmented fine-tuned BERT. We found for Maps Search in
our case, other advanced BERTology family model such as RoBERTa does not
necessarily outperform BERT, and a classic cross-domain fine-tuned full BERT
even underperforms a smaller single-domain fine-tuned BERT. We share more
findings through comprehensive modeling experiments and analysis, we also
briefly cover the data generation algorithm breakthrough.</span>

                                        <span>Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive predictive performance
by learning complex functions of many variables, often at the cost of
interpretability. This chapter covers recent work aiming to interpret models by
attributing importance to features and feature groups for a single prediction.
Importantly, the proposed attributions assign importance to interactions
between features, in addition to features in isolation. These attributions are
shown to yield insights across real-world domains, including bio-imaging,
cosmology image and natural-language processing. We then show how these
attributions can be used to directly improve the generalization of a neural
network or to distill it into a simple model. Throughout the chapter, we
emphasize the use of reality checks to scrutinize the proposed interpretation
techniques.</span>

modular method for controlled text generation. Given a pre-existing model G for
generating text from a distribution of interest, FUDGE enables conditioning on
a desired attribute a (for example, formality) while requiring access only to
G&#x27;s output logits. FUDGE learns an attribute predictor operating on a partial
sequence, and uses this predictor&#x27;s outputs to adjust G&#x27;s original
probabilities. We show that FUDGE models terms corresponding to a Bayesian
decomposition of the conditional distribution of G given attribute a. Moreover,
FUDGE can easily compose predictors for multiple desired attributes. We
evaluate FUDGE on three tasks -- couplet completion in poetry, topic control in
language generation, and formality change in machine translation -- and observe
gains in all three tasks.</span>

(source) and test (target) datasets follow completely the same distribution.
This assumption is, however, often violated in uncertain real-world
applications, which motivates the study of learning under covariate shift. In
this setting, the naive use of adaptive hyperparameter optimization methods
such as Bayesian optimization does not work as desired since it does not
address the distributional shift among different datasets. In this work, we
consider a novel hyperparameter optimization problem under the multi-source
covariate shift whose goal is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a target
task of interest using only unlabeled data in a target task and labeled data in
multiple source tasks. To conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for the
target task, it is essential to estimate the target objective using only the
available information. To this end, we construct the variance reduced estimator
that unbiasedly approximates the target objective with a desirable variance
property. Building on the proposed estimator, we provide a general and
tractable hyperparameter optimization procedure, which works preferably in our
setting with a no-regret guarantee. The experiments demonstrate that the
proposed framework broadens the applications of automated hyperparameter
optimization.</span>

of tasks without incurring catastrophic forgetting. CL settings proposed in the
literature assume that every incoming example is paired with ground-truth
annotations. However, this clashes with many real-world applications: gathering
labeled data, which is in itself tedious and expensive, becomes indeed
infeasible when data flow as a stream and must be consumed in real-time. This
work explores Weakly Supervised Continual Learning (WSCL): here, only a small
fraction of labeled input examples are shown to the learner. We assess how
current CL methods (e.g.: EWC, LwF, iCaRL, ER, GDumb, DER) perform in this
novel and challenging scenario, in which overfitting entangles forgetting.
Subsequently, we design two novel WSCL methods which exploit metric learning
and consistency regularization to leverage unsupervised data while learning. In
doing so, we show that not only our proposals exhibit higher flexibility when
supervised information is scarce, but also that less than 25% labels can be
enough to reach or even outperform SOTA methods trained under full supervision.</span>

in computer vision: self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViT).
While the training recipes for standard convolutional networks have been highly
mature and robust, the recipes for ViT are yet to be built, especially in the
self-supervised scenarios where training becomes more challenging. In this
work, we go back to basics and investigate the effects of several fundamental
components for training self-supervised ViT. We observe that instability is a
major issue that degrades accuracy, and it can be hidden by apparently good
results. We reveal that these results are indeed partial failure, and they can
be improved when training is made more stable. We benchmark ViT results in MoCo
v3 and several other self-supervised frameworks, with ablations in various
aspects. We discuss the currently positive evidence as well as challenges and

introduce Hierarchical Graph Net (HGNet), which for any two connected nodes

                                        <span>The newly emerged transformer technology has a tremendous impact on NLP
research. In the general English domain, transformer-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on various NLP benchmarks. In the clinical
domain, researchers also have investigated transformer models for clinical
applications. The goal of this study is to systematically explore three widely
used transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) for clinical
relation extraction and develop an open-source package with clinical
pre-trained transformer-based models to facilitate information extraction in
the clinical domain. We developed a series of clinical RE models based on three
transformer architectures, namely BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We evaluated these
models using 2 publicly available datasets from 2018 MADE1.0 and 2018 n2c2
challenges. We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class
classification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations
in different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three
transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We
demonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance
on the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958. On the 2018 n2c2
dataset, the XLNet-clinical model achieved the best F1-score of 0.9610. Our
results indicated that the binary classification strategy consistently
outperformed the multi-class classification strategy for clinical relation
extraction. Our methods and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerRelationExtraction.
We believe this work will improve current practice on clinical relation
extraction and other related NLP tasks in the biomedical domain.</span>

                                        <span>Machine unlearning is the task of updating machine learning (ML) models after
a subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the
task are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., they should
effectively &quot;unlearn&quot; deleted data, but in a way that does not require
excessive computation effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of
deletions. Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount
of approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the
spirit of &quot;the right to be forgotten&quot; have given rise to requirements for
certifiability, i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has
indeed been unlearned by the ML model.

In this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art
approximate unlearning methods for linear models and demonstrate the trade-offs
between efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In
implementing the study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a
common ML pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six
real-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the
effect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and
the performance of each unlearning method in different settings. We also
propose a practical online strategy to determine when the accumulated error
from approximate unlearning is large enough to warrant a full retrain of the ML
model.</span>

an Italian food wholesaler, as a step towards the automation of pricing tasks

used in econometric analyses, providing a good benchmark for the problem under

similarly for the forecasting task under consideration, while the combination
of CNNs and LSTMs attains the best overall accuracy, but requires more time to

                                        <span>Confidence calibration is of great importance to the reliability of decisions
made by machine learning systems. However, discriminative classifiers based on
deep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident
predictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of
classification accuracy. We argue that such an inability to model uncertainty
is mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the
cross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined
categories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first
time propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the
modeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the
learning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension
that models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,
and moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially
forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution. Extensive
experiments show that our approach, Energy-based Open-World Softmax
(EOW-Softmax), is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods in improving
confidence calibration.</span>

softmax and cross-entropy as mutual information evaluators. We show that when

the mutual information between inputs and labels through a variational form of
mutual information. Thereby, we develop a new form of softmax that also

procedure. Due to its undecidability in general, a tool for invariant synthesis
necessarily uses heuristics. Despite the common belief that the design of
heuristics is vital for the effective performance of a verifier, little work
has been performed toward obtaining the optimal heuristics for each
invariant-synthesis tool. Instead, developers have hand-tuned the heuristics of
tools. This study demonstrates that we can effectively and automatically learn
a good heuristic via reinforcement learning for an invariant synthesizer PCSat.
Our experiment shows that PCSat combined with the heuristic learned by
reinforcement learning outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers for this task.

architectures learn to classify images in the same order. To understand this
phenomenon, we revisit the over-parametrized deep linear network model. Our
asymptotic analysis, assuming that the hidden layers are wide enough, reveals
that the convergence rate of this model&#x27;s parameters is exponentially faster
along directions corresponding to the larger principal components of the data,
at a rate governed by the singular values. We term this convergence pattern the
Principal Components bias (PC-bias). We show how the PC-bias streamlines the
order of learning of both linear and non-linear networks, more prominently at
earlier stages of learning. We then compare our results to the simplicity bias,
showing that both biases can be seen independently, and affect the order of
learning in different ways. Finally, we discuss how the PC-bias may explain
some benefits of early stopping and its connection to PCA, and why deep
networks converge more slowly when given random labels.</span>

and guidance. It is very challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies in traffic data. Existing works cannot perform well for multi-step
traffic prediction that involves long future time period. The spatiotemporal
information dilution becomes serve when the time gap between input step and
predicted step is large, especially when traffic data is not sufficient or
noisy. To address this issue, we propose a multi-spatial graph convolution
based Seq2Seq model. Our main novelties are three aspects: (1) We enrich the
spatiotemporal information of model inputs by fusing multi-view features (time,
location and traffic states) (2) We build multiple kinds of spatial
correlations based on both prior knowledge and data-driven knowledge to improve
model performance especially in insufficient or noisy data cases. (3) A
spatiotemporal attention mechanism based on reachability knowledge is novelly
designed to produce high-level features fed into decoder of Seq2Seq directly to
ease information dilution. Our model is evaluated on two real world traffic
datasets and achieves better performance than other competitors.</span>

efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship
between multimedia data. However, existing methods have the following
shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large
scale due to the graph construction and eigen-decomposition. (2) They cannot
well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor
points and tensor Schatten p-norm minimization. Specifically, we construct a
hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.

                                        <span>As Deep Neural Network models for face processing tasks approach human-like
performance, their deployment in critical applications such as law enforcement
and access control has seen an upswing, where any failure may have far-reaching
consequences. We need methods to build trust in deployed systems by making
their working as transparent as possible. Existing visualization algorithms are
designed for object recognition and do not give insightful results when applied
to the face domain. In this work, we present &#x27;Canonical Saliency Maps&#x27;, a new
method that highlights relevant facial areas by projecting saliency maps onto a
canonical face model. We present two kinds of Canonical Saliency Maps:
image-level maps and model-level maps. Image-level maps highlight facial
features responsible for the decision made by a deep face model on a given
image, thus helping to understand how a DNN made a prediction on the image.
Model-level maps provide an understanding of what the entire DNN model focuses
on in each task and thus can be used to detect biases in the model. Our
qualitative and quantitative results show the usefulness of the proposed
canonical saliency maps, which can be used on any deep face model regardless of
the architecture.</span>

and function. A quantitative diagnosis technique consists of localizing the CT
slice passing through the middle of the third lumbar area (L3) and segmenting
muscles at this level. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
method for accurate localization of the L3 CT slice. Our method trains a
reinforcement learning agent by incentivizing it to discover the right

follow for this problem. Visualizing the training process shows that the agent
mimics the scrolling of an experienced radiologist. Extensive experiments

However, learning from engagement signals is non-trivial as it is not clear how

interactions. We present VisE, a weakly supervised learning approach, which
maps social images to pseudo labels derived by clustered engagement signals. We

                                        <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning
and are widely deployed in many applications involving image, video, speech and
natural language processing. The increasing compute demands of DNNs have been
widely addressed through Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized
accelerators. However, as model sizes grow, these von Neumann architectures
require very high memory bandwidth to keep the processing elements utilized as
a majority of the data resides in the main memory. Processing in memory has
been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall bottleneck for ML
workloads. In this work, we propose a new DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
multiplication primitive coupled with intra-bank accumulation to accelerate
matrix vector operations in ML workloads. The proposed multiplication primitive
adds &lt; 1% area overhead and does not require any change in the DRAM
peripherals. Therefore, the proposed multiplication can be easily adopted in
commodity DRAM chips. Subsequently, we design a DRAM-based PIM architecture,
data mapping scheme and dataflow for executing DNNs within DRAM. System
evaluations performed on networks like AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet18 show that
the proposed architecture, mapping, and data flow can provide up to 19.5x
speedup over an NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU highlighting the need to overcome the
memory bottleneck in future generations of DNN hardware.</span>

locations to lead significant accuracy improvement in spatial interpolation by
using the prediction uncertainty of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as
&quot;attraction force&quot; to deployed robots in path planning. Although the
integration with Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solvers was also shown to
produce relatively short travel distance, we here hypothesise several factors
that could decrease the overall prediction precision as well because
sub-optimal locations may eventually be included in their paths. To address
this issue, in this paper, we first explore &quot;local planning&quot; approaches
adopting various spatial ranges within which next sampling locations are
prioritized to investigate their effects on the prediction performance as well
as incurred travel distance. Also, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based high-level
controllers are trained to adaptively produce blended plans from a particular
set of local planners to inherit unique strengths from that selection depending
on latest prediction states. Our experiments on use cases of temperature
monitoring robots demonstrate that the dynamic mixtures of planners can not
only generate sophisticated, informative plans that a single planner could not
create alone but also ensure significantly reduced travel distances at no cost
of prediction reliability without any assist of additional modules for shortest

(CSVD-QR) method for matrix complete problem is presented, whose computational
complexity is $O(r^2(m+n))$, which is mainly due to that $r$ is far less than
$\min\{m,n\}$, where $r$ represents the largest number of singular values of
matrix $X$. What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the
nuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as
the upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its
decomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear
norm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal
matrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the
singular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
literature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.
Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model
based on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,
which is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.</span>

                                        <span>Ranked data sets, where m judges/voters specify a preference ranking of n
objects/candidates, are increasingly prevalent in contexts such as political
elections, computer vision, recommender systems, and bioinformatics. The vote
counts for each ranking can be viewed as an n! data vector lying on the
permutahedron, which is a Cayley graph of the symmetric group with vertices
labeled by permutations and an edge when two permutations differ by an adjacent
transposition. Leveraging combinatorial representation theory and recent
progress in signal processing on graphs, we investigate a novel, scalable
transform method to interpret and exploit structure in ranked data. We
represent data on the permutahedron using an overcomplete dictionary of atoms,
each of which captures both smoothness information about the data (typically
the focus of spectral graph decomposition methods in graph signal processing)
and structural information about the data (typically the focus of symmetry
decomposition methods from representation theory). These atoms have a more
naturally interpretable structure than any known basis for signals on the
permutahedron, and they form a Parseval frame, ensuring beneficial numerical
properties such as energy preservation. We develop specialized algorithms and
open software that take advantage of the symmetry and structure of the
permutahedron to improve the scalability of the proposed method, making it more
applicable to the high-dimensional ranked data found in applications.</span>

                                        <span>Measuring the acoustic characteristics of a space is often done by capturing
its impulse response (IR), a representation of how a full-range stimulus sound
excites it. This work generates an IR from a single image, which can then be
applied to other signals using convolution, simulating the reverberant
characteristics of the space shown in the image. Recording these IRs is both
time-intensive and expensive, and often infeasible for inaccessible locations.
We use an end-to-end neural network architecture to generate plausible audio
impulse responses from single images of acoustic environments. We evaluate our
method both by comparisons to ground truth data and by human expert evaluation.
We demonstrate our approach by generating plausible impulse responses from
diverse settings and formats including well known places, musical halls, rooms
in paintings, images from animations and computer games, synthetic environments
generated from text, panoramic images, and video conference backgrounds.</span>

                                        <span>Methods and Materials: We investigated transferability of neural
network-based de-identification sys-tems with and without domain
generalization. We used two domain generalization approaches: a novel approach
Joint-Domain Learning (JDL) as developed in this paper, and a state-of-the-art
domain general-ization approach Common-Specific Decomposition (CSD) from the
literature. First, we measured trans-ferability from a single external source.
Second, we used two external sources and evaluated whether domain
generalization can improve transferability of de-identification models across
domains which rep-resent different note types from the same institution. Third,
using two external sources with in-domain training data, we studied whether
external source data are useful even in cases where sufficient in-domain
training data are available. Finally, we investigated transferability of the
de-identification mod-els across institutions. Results and Conclusions: We
found transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent re-sults.
Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of
approximately 80%, but domain generalization was not always helpful to improve
transferability. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases
where in-domain training data were available by reducing the amount of needed
in-domain training data or by improving performance. Transferability across
institutions was differed by note type and annotation label. External sources
from a different institution were also useful to further improve performance.</span>

redundancy such that it is guessed that the DNNs could be trained in
low-dimensional subspaces. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Linear
Dimensionality Reduction (DLDR) based on low-dimensional properties of the
training trajectory. The reduction is efficient, which is supported by
comprehensive experiments: optimization in 40 dimensional spaces can achieve
comparable performance as regular training over thousands or even millions of

quasi-Newton-based algorithm and also obtain robustness against label noises,
which are two follow-up experiments to show the advantages of finding

transfer learning to exploit their commonality. The adversarial neural transfer
(ANT) framework utilizes multiple loss terms that encourage the source-domain
and the target-domain feature distributions to be similar while optimizing for
domain-specific performance. However, these objectives may be in conflict,
which can lead to optimization difficulties and sometimes diminished transfer.
We propose a generalized latent optimization strategy that allows different

representation, reasoning, and data mining applications. However, for multiple
cross-domain knowledge graphs, state-of-the-art embedding models cannot make
full use of the data from different knowledge domains while preserving the
privacy of exchanged data. In addition, the centralized embedding model may not
scale to the extensive real-world knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a
novel decentralized scalable learning framework, \emph{Federated Knowledge
Graphs Embedding} (FKGE), where embeddings from different knowledge graphs can
be learnt in an asynchronous and peer-to-peer manner while being
privacy-preserving. FKGE exploits adversarial generation between pairs of
knowledge graphs to translate identical entities and relations of different
domains into near embedding spaces. In order to protect the privacy of the
training data, FKGE further implements a privacy-preserving neural network
structure to guarantee no raw data leakage. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate FKGE on 11 knowledge graphs, demonstrating a significant and
consistent improvement in model quality with at most 17.85\% and 7.90\%
increases in performance on triple classification and link prediction tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging learning problem in
pattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters,
different handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages
and scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades but there is
very limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors,
like, diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts
on handcrafted feature extraction techniques which are language/script specific
and are not always available, and unavailability of public datasets and codes
to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge
success in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides
end-to-end learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In
this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning architecture which exploits
transfer learning and image-augmentation for end-to-end learning for script
independent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net. The network is
based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers
of a pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and
image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training, better performance and
better generalisations. The experimental results on publicly available datasets
of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada,
Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of
HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks. For reproducibility of the
results and for the advancements of the HCR research, complete code is publicly
released at \href{https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/HCR-Net}{GitHub}.</span>

methods. In some target problem domains, there are not many data samples
available, which could significantly hinder the learning process. While data
from similar domains may be leveraged to help through domain adaptation,
obtaining high-quality labeled data for those source domains themselves could
be difficult or costly. To address such challenges on data insufficiency for
classification problem in a target domain, we propose a weak adaptation
learning (WAL) approach that leverages unlabeled data from a similar source
domain, a low-cost weak annotator that produces labels based on task-specific
heuristics, labeling rules, or other methods (albeit with inaccuracy), and a
small amount of labeled data in the target domain. Our approach first conducts
a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with
respect to the data quantity and the performance of the weak annotator, and
then introduces a multi-stage weak adaptation learning method to learn an
accurate classifier by lowering the error bound. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach in learning an accurate classifier with
limited labeled data in the target domain and unlabeled data in the source
domain.</span>

multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Our method
deterministically quantizes layers in an iterative fashion with no complicated
re-training required. Specifically, we quantize each neuron, or hidden unit,
using a greedy path-following algorithm. This simple algorithm is equivalent to
running a dynamical system, which we prove is stable for quantizing a
single-layer neural network (or, alternatively, for quantizing the first layer
of a multi-layer network) when the training data are Gaussian. We show that
under these assumptions, the quantization error decays with the width of the
layer, i.e., its level of over-parametrization. We provide numerical
experiments, on multi-layer networks, to illustrate the performance of our
methods on MNIST and CIFAR10 data, as well as for quantizing the VGG16 network

shift, we determine the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood
estimator. We find that it is a function of the Brier score for the regression
of the class label against the features under the test data set distribution.
This observation suggests that optimising the accuracy of a base classifier on
the training data set helps to reduce the variance of the related quantifier on
the test data set. Therefore, we also point out training criteria for the base
classifier that imply optimisation of both of the Brier scores on the training

                                        <span>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are increasingly adopted in large-scale
graph-based recommender systems. Training GCN requires the minibatch generator
traversing graphs and sampling the sparsely located neighboring nodes to obtain
their features. Since real-world graphs often exceed the capacity of GPU
memory, current GCN training systems keep the feature table in host memory and
rely on the CPU to collect sparse features before sending them to the GPUs.
This approach, however, puts tremendous pressure on host memory bandwidth and
the CPU. This is because the CPU needs to (1) read sparse features from memory,
(2) write features into memory as a dense format, and (3) transfer the features
from memory to the GPUs. In this work, we propose a novel GPU-oriented data
communication approach for GCN training, where GPU threads directly access
sparse features in host memory through zero-copy accesses without much CPU
help. By removing the CPU gathering stage, our method significantly reduces the
consumption of the host resources and data access latency. We further present
two important techniques to achieve high host memory access efficiency by the
GPU: (1) automatic data access address alignment to maximize PCIe packet
efficiency, and (2) asynchronous zero-copy access and kernel execution to fully
overlap data transfer with training. We incorporate our method into PyTorch and
evaluate its effectiveness using several graphs with sizes up to 111 million
nodes and 1.6 billion edges. In a multi-GPU training setup, our method is
65-92% faster than the conventional data transfer method, and can even match
the performance of all-in-GPU-memory training for some graphs that fit in GPU
memory.</span>

clients (i.e., organisations or devices) train models locally and formulate a
global model based on the local model updates without transferring local data
externally. However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve
trustworthiness and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated
learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to
multi-stakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To
enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we
present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We
first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable
accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm
to enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a
COVID-19 X-ray detection use case. The evaluation results show that the
approach is feasible to enable accountability and improve fairness. The
proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the default federated

                                        <span>Unsupervised representation learning has achieved outstanding performances
using centralized data available on the Internet. However, the increasing
awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image
data that grows explosively in multiple parties (e.g., mobile phones and
cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn
visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To
address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning
framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled
data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a
target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates
clients&#x27; models with the aggregated model. It preserves data privacy as each
party only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple
parties are normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID),
leading to performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose two
simple but effective methods: 1) We design the communication protocol to upload
only the encoders of online networks for server aggregation and update them
with the aggregated encoder; 2) We introduce a new module to dynamically decide
how to update predictors based on the divergence caused by non-IID. The
predictor is the other component of the online network. Extensive experiments
and ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FedU. It
outperforms training with only one party by over 5% and other methods by over
14% in linear and semi-supervised evaluation on non-IID data.</span>

                                        <span>A central question in federated learning (FL) is how to design optimization
algorithms that minimize the communication cost of training a model over
heterogeneous data distributed across many clients. A popular technique for
reducing communication is the use of local steps, where clients take multiple
optimization steps over local data before communicating with the server (e.g.,
FedAvg, SCAFFOLD). This contrasts with centralized methods, where clients take
one optimization step per communication round (e.g., Minibatch SGD). A recent
lower bound on the communication complexity of first-order methods shows that
centralized methods are optimal over highly-heterogeneous data, whereas local
methods are optimal over purely homogeneous data [Woodworth et al., 2020]. For
intermediate heterogeneity levels, no algorithm is known to match the lower
bound. In this paper, we propose a multistage optimization scheme that nearly
matches the lower bound across all heterogeneity levels. The idea is to first
run a local method up to a heterogeneity-induced error floor; next, we switch
to a centralized method for the remaining steps. Our analysis may help explain
empirically-successful stepsize decay methods in FL [Charles et al., 2020;
Reddi et al., 2020]. We demonstrate the scheme&#x27;s practical utility in image
classification tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Purpose: We propose a deep learning-based computer-aided detection (CADe)
method to detect breast lesions in ultrafast DCE-MRI sequences. This method
uses both the three-dimensional spatial information and temporal information
obtained from the early-phase of the dynamic acquisition. Methods: The proposed
CADe method, based on a modified 3D RetinaNet model, operates on ultrafast T1
weighted sequences, which are preprocessed for motion compensation, temporal
normalization, and are cropped before passing into the model. The model is
optimized to enable the detection of relatively small breast lesions in a
screening setting, focusing on detection of lesions that are harder to
differentiate from confounding structures inside the breast. Results: The
method was developed based on a dataset consisting of 489 ultrafast MRI studies
obtained from 462 patients containing a total of 572 lesions (365 malignant,
207 benign) and achieved a detection rate, sensitivity, and detection rate of
benign lesions of 0.90 (0.876-0.934), 0.95 (0.934-0.980), and 0.81
(0.751-0.871) at 4 false positives per normal breast with 10-fold
cross-testing, respectively. Conclusions: The deep learning architecture used
for the proposed CADe application can efficiently detect benign and malignant
lesions on ultrafast DCE-MRI. Furthermore, utilizing the less visible hard-to
detect-lesions in training improves the learning process and, subsequently,
detection of malignant breast lesions.</span>

unlabeled image collections. Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn
useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each
input image or by speculatively picking negative samples, we instead also make
use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured
using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available
context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal
relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations
that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by
first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those
images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task
of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be
adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human
supervision. We present results on four different camera trap image
collections, across three different families of self-supervised learning
methods, and show that careful image selection at training time results in
superior performance compared to existing baselines such as conventional

                                        <span>Named entity recognition (NER) is usually developed and tested on text from
well-written sources. However, in intelligent voice assistants, where NER is an
important component, input to NER may be noisy because of user or speech
recognition error. In applications, entity labels may change frequently, and
non-textual properties like topicality or popularity may be needed to choose
among alternatives.

We describe a NER system intended to address these problems. We test and
train this system on a proprietary user-derived dataset. We compare with a
baseline text-only NER system; the baseline enhanced with external gazetteers;
and the baseline enhanced with the search and indirect labelling techniques we
describe below. The final configuration gives around 6% reduction in NER error
rate. We also show that this technique improves related tasks, such as semantic
parsing, with an improvement of up to 5% in error rate.</span>

progress in a wide range of tasks including computer vision, natural language
processing, and reinforcement learning. The extraordinary performance of these
systems often gives the impression that they can be used to revolutionise our
lives for the better. However, as recent works point out, these systems suffer
from several issues that make them unreliable for use in the real world,
including vulnerability to adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al. [248]), tendency
to memorise noise (Zhang et al. [292]), being over-confident on incorrect
predictions (miscalibration) (Guo et al. [99]), and unsuitability for handling
private data (Gilad-Bachrach et al. [88]). In this thesis, we look at each of
these issues in detail, investigate their causes, and propose computationally
cheap algorithms for mitigating them in practice. To do this, we identify
structures in deep neural networks that can be exploited to mitigate the above
causes of unreliability of deep learning algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Modeling inter-dependencies between time-series is the key to achieve high
performance in anomaly detection for multivariate time-series data. The
de-facto solution to model the dependencies is to feed the data into a
recurrent neural network (RNN). However, the fully connected network structure
underneath the RNN (either GRU or LSTM) assumes a static and complete
dependency graph between time-series, which may not hold in many real-world
applications. To alleviate this assumption, we propose a dynamic bipartite
graph structure to encode the inter-dependencies between time-series. More
concretely, we model time series as one type of nodes, and the time series
segments (regarded as event) as another type of nodes, where the edge between
two types of nodes describe a temporal pattern occurred on a specific time
series at a certain time. Based on this design, relations between time series
can be explicitly modelled via dynamic connections to event nodes, and the
multivariate time-series anomaly detection problem can be formulated as a
self-supervised, edge stream prediction problem in dynamic graphs. We conducted
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design.</span>

                                        <span>Since the Lipschitz properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
widely considered to be related to adversarial robustness, we theoretically
characterize the $\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm of 2D multi-channel
convolutional layers and provide efficient methods to compute the exact
$\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm. Based on our theorem, we propose a novel
regularization method termed norm decay, which can effectively reduce the norms
of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. Experiments show that
norm-regularization methods, including norm decay, weight decay, and singular
value clipping, can improve generalization of CNNs. However, they can slightly
hurt adversarial robustness. Observing this unexpected phenomenon, we compute
the norms of layers in the CNNs trained with three different adversarial
training frameworks and surprisingly find that adversarially robust CNNs have
comparable or even larger layer norms than their non-adversarially robust
counterparts. Furthermore, we prove that under a mild assumption, adversarially
robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially
robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant. For
this reason, enforcing small norms on CNN layers may be neither necessary nor
effective in achieving adversarial robustness. The code is available at

                                        <span>We propose ResRep, a novel method for lossless channel pruning (a.k.a. filter
pruning), which slims down a CNN by reducing the width (number of output
channels) of convolutional layers. Inspired by the neurobiology research about
the independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a
CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to
maintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with
regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the
latter, we realize structured sparsity. Then we equivalently merge the
remembering and forgetting parts into the original architecture with narrower
layers. In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of
Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from
the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on
parameters to produce sparsity, which may suppress the parameters essential for
the remembering. ResRep slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on
ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop, which is
the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio. The

                                        <span>Since its invention, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown
outstanding results in many applications. Generative Adversarial Networks are
powerful yet, resource-hungry deep-learning models. Their main difference from
ordinary deep learning models is the nature of their output. For example, GAN
output can be a whole image versus other models detecting objects or
classifying images. Thus, the architecture and numeric precision of the network
affect the quality and speed of the solution. Hence, accelerating GANs is
pivotal. Accelerating GANs can be classified into three main tracks: (1) Memory
compression, (2) Computation optimization, and (3) Data-flow optimization.
Because data transfer is the main source of energy usage, memory compression
leads to the most savings. Thus, in this paper, we survey memory compression
techniques for CNN-Based GANs. Additionally, the paper summarizes opportunities
and challenges in GANs acceleration and suggests open research problems to be
further investigated.</span>

                                        <span>In several real world applications, machine learning models are deployed to
make predictions on data whose distribution changes gradually along time,
leading to a drift between the train and test distributions. Such models are
often re-trained on new data periodically, and they hence need to generalize to
data not too far into the future. In this context, there is much prior work on
enhancing temporal generalization, e.g. continuous transportation of past data,
kernel smoothed time-sensitive parameters and more recently, adversarial
learning of time-invariant features. However, these methods share several
limitations, e.g, poor scalability, training instability, and dependence on
unlabeled data from the future. Responding to the above limitations, we propose
a simple method that starts with a model with time-sensitive parameters but
regularizes its temporal complexity using a Gradient Interpolation (GI) loss.
GI allows the decision boundary to change along time and can still prevent
overfitting to the limited training time snapshots by allowing task-specific
control over changes along time. We compare our method to existing baselines on
multiple real-world datasets, which show that GI outperforms more complicated
generative and adversarial approaches on the one hand, and simpler gradient
regularization methods on the other.</span>

human-computer interaction systems. Despite recent advancements in FER,
performance often drops significantly for non-frontal facial images. We propose
Contrastive Learning of Multi-view facial Expressions (CL-MEx) to exploit
facial images captured simultaneously from different angles towards FER. CL-MEx
is a two-step training framework. In the first step, an encoder network is
pre-trained with the proposed self-supervised contrastive loss, where it learns
to generate view-invariant embeddings for different views of a subject. The
model is then fine-tuned with labeled data in a supervised setting. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on two multi-view FER
datasets, KDEF and DDCF, where state-of-the-art performances are achieved.
Further experiments show the robustness of our method in dealing with
challenging angles and reduced amounts of labeled data.</span>

as a single aggregate on a given test data distribution, but as a surface over
a large number of combinations of attributes characterizing multiple test data
distributions. Such attributed accuracy measures become important as machine
learning models get deployed as a service, where the training data distribution
is hidden from clients, and different clients may be interested in diverse
regions of the data distribution. We present Attributed Accuracy Assay (AAA)--a
Gaussian Process (GP)--based probabilistic estimator for such an accuracy
surface. Each attribute combination, called an &#x27;arm&#x27;, is associated with a Beta
density from which the service&#x27;s accuracy is sampled. We expect the GP to
smooth the parameters of the Beta density over related arms to mitigate
sparsity. We show that obvious application of GPs cannot address the challenge
of heteroscedastic uncertainty over a huge attribute space that is sparsely and
unevenly populated. In response, we present two enhancements: pooling sparse
observations, and regularizing the scale parameter of the Beta densities. After
introducing these innovations, we establish the effectiveness of AAA in terms
of both its estimation accuracy and exploration efficiency, through extensive

very high confidence on out-of-distribution inputs (OODs). This limitation is
one of the key challenges in the adoption of DNNs in high-assurance systems
such as autonomous driving, air traffic management, and medical diagnosis. This
challenge has received significant attention recently, and several techniques
have been developed to detect inputs where the model&#x27;s prediction cannot be

Markovian noise. A prominent application of our algorithmic developments is the
stochastic policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning. Prior
investigations in the literature focused on temporal difference (TD) learning
by employing nonsmooth finite time analysis motivated by stochastic subgradient
descent leading to certain limitations. These encompass the requirement of
analyzing a modified TD algorithm that involves projection to an a-priori
defined Euclidean ball, achieving a non-optimal convergence rate and no clear
way of deriving the beneficial effects of parallel implementation. Our approach
remedies these shortcomings in the broader context of stochastic VIs and in
particular when it comes to stochastic policy evaluation. We developed a
variety of simple TD learning type algorithms motivated by its original version
that maintain its simplicity, while offering distinct advantages from a
non-asymptotic analysis point of view. We first provide an improved analysis of
the standard TD algorithm that can benefit from parallel implementation. Then
we present versions of a conditional TD algorithm (CTD), that involves periodic
updates of the stochastic iterates, which reduce the bias and therefore exhibit
improved iteration complexity. This brings us to the fast TD (FTD) algorithm
which combines elements of CTD and the stochastic operator extrapolation method
of the companion paper. For a novel index resetting policy FTD exhibits the
best known convergence rate. We also devised a robust version of the algorithm
that is particularly suitable for discounting factors close to 1.</span>

learning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional
damage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building
requires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A
practical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential
learning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases
that are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information
theoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective
criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample
selection scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI
algorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local
kernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the
adaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the
original formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local
kernels methodology is developed that allows for the conformability of the
kernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational
complexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to
work on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel
hyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood
estimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters
can be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion
performance. The advantages are demonstrated on a simulation of the 2018
Anchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm
enables GPR to reach acceptable performance with fewer training data, the
computational demands remain lower than the standard local kernels strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Traditional normalization techniques (e.g., Batch Normalization and Instance
Normalization) generally and simplistically assume that training and test data
follow the same distribution. As distribution shifts are inevitable in
real-world applications, well-trained models with previous normalization
methods can perform badly in new environments. Can we develop new normalization
methods to improve generalization robustness under distribution shifts? In this
paper, we answer the question by proposing CrossNorm and SelfNorm. CrossNorm
exchanges channel-wise mean and variance between feature maps to enlarge
training distribution, while SelfNorm uses attention to recalibrate the
statistics to bridge gaps between training and test distributions. CrossNorm
and SelfNorm can complement each other, though exploring different directions
in statistics usage. Extensive experiments on different fields (vision and
language), tasks (classification and segmentation), settings (supervised and
semi-supervised), and distribution shift types (synthetic and natural) show the
effectiveness. Code is available at

                                        <span>We present a general technique for constructing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
capable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on
mode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE
identifies a most-specific logical formula $\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the
relational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We represent $\bot_B(e)$
by a &quot;bottom-graph&quot; that can be converted into a form suitable for GNN
implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of incorporating
generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term &#x60;BotGNN&#x27; for this form
of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using real-world datasets
with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs perform
significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a recently
proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into GNNs. We also
provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a &quot;propositionalised&quot; form of
the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard ILP based on the use of
most-specific clauses. Taken together, these results point to BotGNNs as
capable of combining the computational efficacy of GNNs with the
representational versatility of ILP.</span>

method known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimizing general
non-convex loss functions. Our main contribution is providing upper bounds on
the generalization error that depend on local statistics of the stochastic
gradients evaluated along the path of iterates calculated by SGD. The key
factors our bounds depend on are the variance of the gradients (with respect to
the data distribution) and the local smoothness of the objective function along
the SGD path, and the sensitivity of the loss function to perturbations to the
final output. Our key technical tool is combining the information-theoretic

                                        <span>Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to
partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent
functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly
applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community
detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety
of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network
methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly
more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed,
particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into
low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is
still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological
underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for
future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop
and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to
characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection.
Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community
detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing
methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep
learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two
categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection,
we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and
highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude
with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible
directions for future research.</span>

learning a mapping from a source domain to a target domain with unpaired image
data. Though the existing methods have achieved promising results, they still
produce visual artifacts, being able to translate low-level information but not
high-level semantics of input images. One possible reason is that generators do
not have the ability to perceive the most discriminative parts between the
source and target domains, thus making the generated images low quality. In
this paper, we propose a new Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks
(AttentionGAN) for the unpaired image-to-image translation task. AttentionGAN
can identify the most discriminative foreground objects and minimize the change
of the background. The attention-guided generators in AttentionGAN are able to
produce attention masks, and then fuse the generation output with the attention
masks to obtain high-quality target images. Accordingly, we also design a novel
attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several generative tasks with eight public
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is effective to generate
sharper and more realistic images compared with existing competitive models.

                                        <span>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method to train efficient networks
(&quot;student&quot;) with the help of high-capacity networks (&quot;teacher&quot;). Traditional
methods use the teacher&#x27;s soft logits as extra supervision to train the student
network. In this paper, we argue that it is more advantageous to make the
student mimic the teacher&#x27;s features in the penultimate layer. Not only the
student can directly learn more effective information from the teacher feature,
feature mimicking can also be applied for teachers trained without a softmax
layer. Experiments show that it can achieve higher accuracy than traditional
KD. To further facilitate feature mimicking, we decompose a feature vector into
the magnitude and the direction. We argue that the teacher should give more
freedom to the student feature&#x27;s magnitude, and let the student pay more
attention on mimicking the feature direction. To meet this requirement, we
propose a loss term based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). With the help of
this new loss, our method indeed mimics feature directions more accurately,
relaxes constraints on feature magnitudes, and achieves state-of-the-art
distillation accuracy. We provide theoretical analyses of how LSH facilitates
feature direction mimicking, and further extend feature mimicking to
multi-label recognition and object detection.</span>

                                        <span>Polynomial expansions are important in the analysis of neural network
nonlinearities. They have been applied thereto addressing well-known
difficulties in verification, explainability, and security. Existing approaches
span classical Taylor and Chebyshev methods, asymptotics, and many numerical
approaches. We find that while these individually have useful properties such
as exact error formulas, adjustable domain, and robustness to undefined
derivatives, there are no approaches that provide a consistent method yielding
an expansion with all these properties. To address this, we develop an
analytically modified integral transform expansion (AMITE), a novel expansion
via integral transforms modified using derived criteria for convergence. We
show the general expansion and then demonstrate application for two popular
activation functions, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. Compared
with existing expansions (i.e., Chebyshev, Taylor, and numerical) employed to
this end, AMITE is the first to provide six previously mutually exclusive
desired expansion properties such as exact formulas for the coefficients and
exact expansion errors (Table II). We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMITE in
two case studies. First, a multivariate polynomial form is efficiently
extracted from a single hidden layer black-box MLP to facilitate equivalence
testing from noisy stimulus-response pairs. Second, a variety of FFNN
architectures having between 3 and 7 layers are range bounded using Taylor
models improved by the AMITE polynomials and error formulas. AMITE presents a
new dimension of expansion methods suitable for analysis/approximation of
nonlinearities in neural networks, opening new directions and opportunities for
the theoretical analysis and systematic testing of neural networks.</span>

the data privacy and security have drawn an increasing attention. Several
attempts have been made to alleviate the leakage of identity information from
face photos, with the aid of, e.g., image obfuscation techniques. However, most
of the present results are either perceptually unsatisfactory or ineffective
against face recognition systems. Our goal in this paper is to develop a
technique that can encrypt the personal photos such that they can protect users
from unauthorized face recognition systems but remain visually identical to the
original version for human beings. To achieve this, we propose a targeted
identity-protection iterative method (TIP-IM) to generate adversarial identity
masks which can be overlaid on facial images, such that the original identities
can be concealed without sacrificing the visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TIP-IM provides 95\%+ protection success rate against various
state-of-the-art face recognition models under practical test scenarios.
Besides, we also show the practical and effective applicability of our method
on a commercial API service.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shifted network design from using human
intuition to leveraging search algorithms guided by evaluation metrics. We
study channel size optimization in convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
identify the role it plays in model accuracy and complexity. Current channel
size selection methods are generally limited by discrete sample spaces while
suffering from manual iteration and simple heuristics. To solve this, we
introduce an efficient dynamic scaling algorithm -- CONet -- that automatically
optimizes channel sizes across network layers for a given CNN. Two metrics --
&#x60;&#x60;\textit{Rank}&quot; and &quot;\textit{Rank Average Slope}&quot; -- are introduced to
identify the information accumulated in training. The algorithm dynamically
scales channel sizes up or down over a fixed searching phase. We conduct
experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets and show that CONet can find
efficient and accurate architectures searched in ResNet, DARTS, and DARTS+
spaces that outperform their baseline models.</span>

                                        <span>Scientific machine learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems
and PDE discoveries in computational physics. One caveat of current methods
however is the need for large amounts of (clean) data in order to recover full
system responses or underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be
particularly promising to overcome these challenges as they are naturally less
sensitive to sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian
neural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from
measurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian
Monte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and
show that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity
without overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained
BNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives
potentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a
Bayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space
and time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the
confidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative
variance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain
surrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery. We
demonstrate our approach on a handful of example applied to physics and
non-linear dynamics.</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research
interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation --- describing a shape
as a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and
point clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely
used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the
sequential and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant
challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD
operations and natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on
the Transformer. We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape
autoencoding and random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new
CAD dataset consisting of 178,238 models and their CAD construction sequences.
We have made this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this
topic.</span>

While many tools have been developed to simulate neuronal dynamics or convert
deep networks to spiking models, general software libraries for learning rules
remain underexplored. This is partly due to the diverse, challenging nature of
efforts to design new learning rules, which range from encoding methods to
gradient approximations, from population approaches that mimic the Bayesian
brain to constrained learning algorithms deployed on memristor crossbars. To
address this gap, we present Neko, a modular, extensible library with a focus
on aiding the design of new learning algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of
Neko in three exemplar cases: online local learning, probabilistic learning,
and analog on-device learning. Our results show that Neko can replicate the
state-of-the-art algorithms and, in one case, lead to significant
outperformance in accuracy and speed. Further, it offers tools including
gradient comparison that can help develop new algorithmic variants. Neko is an

                                        <span>Sleep staging plays an important role on the diagnosis of sleep disorders. In
general, experts classify sleep stages manually based on polysomnography (PSG),
which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile, the acquisition process of multiple
signals is much complex, which can affect the subject&#x27;s sleep. Therefore, the
use of single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging
has become a popular research topic. In the literature, a large number of sleep
staging methods based on single-channel EEG have been proposed with promising
results and achieve the preliminary automation of sleep staging. However, the
performance for most of these methods in the N1 stage do not satisfy the needs
of the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model multi scale
dual attention network(MSDAN) based on raw EEG, which utilizes multi-scale
convolution to extract features in different waveforms contained in the EEG
signal, connects channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms in series
to filter and highlight key information, and uses soft thresholding to remove
redundant information. Experiments were conducted using two datasets with
5-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation method. The final average
accuracy, overall accuracy, macro F1 score and Cohen&#x27;s Kappa coefficient of the
model reach 96.70%, 91.74%, 0.8231 and 0.8723 on the Sleep-EDF dataset, 96.14%,
90.35%, 0.7945 and 0.8284 on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. Significantly, our model
performed superiorly in the N1 stage, with F1 scores of 54.41% and 52.79% on
the two datasets respectively. The results show the superiority of our network
over the existing methods, reaching a new state-of-the-art. In particular, the
proposed method achieves excellent results in the N1 sleep stage compared to
other methods.</span>

                                        <span>While deep reinforcement learning has achieved promising results in
challenging decision-making tasks, the main bones of its success --- deep
neural networks are mostly black-boxes. A feasible way to gain insight into a
black-box model is to distill it into an interpretable model such as a decision
tree, which consists of if-then rules and is easy to grasp and be verified.
However, the traditional model distillation is usually a supervised learning
task under a stationary data distribution assumption, which is violated in
reinforcement learning. Therefore, a typical policy distillation that clones
model behaviors with even a small error could bring a data distribution shift,
resulting in an unsatisfied distilled policy model with low fidelity or low
performance. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by changing the
distillation objective from behavior cloning to maximizing an advantage
evaluation. The novel distillation objective maximizes an approximated
cumulative reward and focuses more on disastrous behaviors in critical states,
which controls the data shift effect. We evaluate our method on several Gym
tasks, a commercial fight game, and a self-driving car simulator. The empirical
results show that the proposed method can preserve a higher cumulative reward
than behavior cloning and learn a more consistent policy to the original one.
Moreover, by examining the extracted rules from the distilled decision trees,
we demonstrate that the proposed method delivers reasonable and robust
decisions.</span>

                                        <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Vast research focuses on improving the accuracy
of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom levels. It
then reconciles forecasts at each hierarchy to further improve the overall
performance. In this paper, we present a hierarchical forecasting approach that
treats the bottom level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting
accuracy on the upper levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning
forecasting approach N-BEATS for continuous time series on top levels and a
widely used tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the bottom level intermittent
time series. The hierarchical forecasting with alignment approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, which accounts for biases that
are difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at
the lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The approach is also business
orientated and could be beneficial for business strategic planning.</span>

                                        <span>The problem of finding the unique low dimensional decomposition of a given
matrix has been a fundamental and recurrent problem in many areas. In this
paper, we study the problem of seeking a unique decomposition of a low rank
matrix $Y\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ that admits a sparse representation.
Specifically, we consider $Y &#x3D; A X\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ where the matrix
$A\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times r}$ has full column rank, with $r &lt; \min\{n,p\}$, and
the matrix $X\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ is element-wise sparse. We prove that
this sparse decomposition of $Y$ can be uniquely identified, up to some
intrinsic signed permutation. Our approach relies on solving a nonconvex
optimization problem constrained over the unit sphere. Our geometric analysis
for the nonconvex optimization landscape shows that any {\em strict} local
solution is close to the ground truth solution, and can be recovered by a
simple data-driven initialization followed with any second order descent
algorithm. At last, we corroborate these theoretical results with numerical
experiments.</span>

bottleneck in their scalability. This work considers a parameter-server setting
in which the worker is constrained to communicate information to the server
using only $R$ bits per dimension. We show that $\mathbf{democratic}$
$\mathbf{embeddings}$ from random matrix theory are significantly useful for
designing efficient and optimal vector quantizers that respect this bit budget.
The resulting polynomial complexity source coding schemes are used to design
distributed optimization algorithms with convergence rates matching the minimax

mathematical consequence of applying quiver representation theory to neural
networks. Neural teleportation &quot;teleports&quot; a network to a new position in the
weight space and preserves its function. This phenomenon comes directly from
the definitions of representation theory applied to neural networks and it
turns out to be a very simple operation that has remarkable properties. We shed
light on surprising and counter-intuitive consequences neural teleportation has
on the loss landscape. In particular, we show that teleportation can be used to
explore loss level curves, that it changes the local loss landscape, sharpens
global minima and boosts back-propagated gradients at any moment during the
learning process. Our results can be reproduced with the code available here:

of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation with a low
computation requirement. The system consists of a CNN for the main processing
for the segmentation, a pre-CNN block for data reduction and post-CNN
refinement block. The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving
only 108 kernels and 20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed,
following the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application specific CNN), to perform
mono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization and
pixel classification. Each layer fits the task assigned to it, by means of (i)
appropriate normalization applied to its input data, (ii) correct convolution
modes for the assigned task, and (iii) suitable nonlinear transformation to
optimize the convolution results. In this specific design context, the number
of kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task,
instead of exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information
density and to reduce randomness in the processing. The proposed activation
function Full-ReLU helps to halve the number of kernels in convolution layers
of high-pass filtering without degrading processing quality. A large number of
experiments with BRATS2018 dataset have been conducted to measure the
processing quality and reproducibility of the proposed system. The results
demonstrate that the system reproduces reliably almost the same output to the
same input after retraining. The mean dice scores for enhancing tumor, whole
tumor and tumor core are 77.2%, 89.2% and 76.3%, respectively. The simple
structure and reliable high processing quality of the proposed system will
facilitate its implementation and medical applications.</span>

mode of transportation wherein travel requests are dynamically handled by a
coordinated fleet of robotic, self-driving vehicles. Given a graph
representation of the transportation network - one where, for example, nodes
represent areas of the city, and edges the connectivity between them - we argue
that the AMoD control problem is naturally cast as a node-wise decision-making
problem. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to
control the rebalancing of AMoD systems through graph neural networks.
Crucially, we demonstrate that graph neural networks enable reinforcement
learning agents to recover behavior policies that are significantly more
transferable, generalizable, and scalable than policies learned through other
approaches. Empirically, we show how the learned policies exhibit promising
zero-shot transfer capabilities when faced with critical portability tasks such
as inter-city generalization, service area expansion, and adaptation to
potentially complex urban topologies.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional works that learn grasping affordance from demonstrations need to
explicitly predict grasping configurations, such as gripper approaching angles
or grasping preshapes. Classic motion planners could then sample trajectories
by using such predicted configurations. In this work, our goal is instead to
fill the gap between affordance discovery and affordance-based policy learning
by integrating the two objectives in an end-to-end imitation learning framework
based on deep neural networks. From a psychological perspective, there is a
close association between attention and affordance. Therefore, with an
end-to-end neural network, we propose to learn affordance cues as visual
attention that serves as a useful indicating signal of how a demonstrator
accomplishes tasks, instead of explicitly modeling affordances. To achieve
this, we propose a contrastive learning framework that consists of a Siamese
encoder and a trajectory decoder. We further introduce a coupled triplet loss
to encourage the discovered affordance cues to be more affordance-relevant. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our model with the coupled triplet loss
achieves the highest grasping success rate in a simulated robot environment.

                                        <span>In this paper we present a general framework for estimating regression models
subject to a user-defined level of fairness. We enforce fairness as a model
selection step in which we choose the value of a ridge penalty to control the
effect of sensitive attributes. We then estimate the parameters of the model
conditional on the chosen penalty value. Our proposal is mathematically simple,
with a solution that is partly in closed form, and produces estimates of the
regression coefficients that are intuitive to interpret as a function of the
level of fairness. Furthermore, it is easily extended to generalised linear
models, kernelised regression models and other penalties; and it can
accommodate multiple definitions of fairness.

We compare our approach with the regression model from Komiyama et al.
(2018), which implements a provably-optimal linear regression model; and with
the fair models from Zafar et al. (2019). We evaluate these approaches
empirically on six different data sets, and we find that our proposal provides
better goodness of fit and better predictive accuracy for the same level of
fairness. In addition, we highlight a source of bias in the original
experimental evaluation in Komiyama et al. (2018).</span>

                                        <span>Monocular depth inference has gained tremendous attention from researchers in
recent years and remains as a promising replacement for expensive
time-of-flight sensors, but issues with scale acquisition and implementation
overhead still plague these systems. To this end, this work presents an
unsupervised learning framework that is able to predict at-scale depth maps and
egomotion, in addition to camera intrinsics, from a sequence of monocular
images via a single network. Our method incorporates both spatial and temporal
geometric constraints to resolve depth and pose scale factors, which are
enforced within the supervisory reconstruction loss functions at training time.
Only unlabeled stereo sequences are required for training the weights of our
single-network architecture, which reduces overall implementation overhead as
compared to previous methods. Our results demonstrate strong performance when
compared to the current state-of-the-art on multiple sequences of the KITTI
driving dataset and can provide faster training times with its reduced network
complexity.</span>

                                        <span>This paper tackles the task of category-level pose estimation for garments.
With a near infinite degree of freedom, a garment&#x27;s full configuration (i.e.,
poses) is often described by the per-vertex 3D locations of its entire 3D
surface. However, garments are also commonly subject to extreme cases of
self-occlusion, especially when folded or crumpled, making it challenging to
perceive their full 3D surface. To address these challenges, we propose
GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose
estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This
canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category,
therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed
partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the
output representation describes the garment&#x27;s full configuration using a
complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label. To properly
handle the thin 3D structure presented on garments, we proposed a novel 3D
shape representation using the generalized winding number field. Experiments
demonstrate that GarmentNets is able to generalize to unseen garment instances
and achieve significantly better performance compared to alternative
approaches.</span>

model can easily become overfitted based on the biased distribution formed by
only a few training examples. In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of
these few-sample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with
sufficient examples, then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from
the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume
every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution
so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of
similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number
of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature
extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a
simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from
our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on two
datasets (~5% improvement on miniImageNet compared to the next best). The
visualization of these generated features demonstrates that our calibrated
distribution is an accurate estimation.</span>

creativity. This paper introduces from first principles an abstract algebraic
framework of analogical proportions of the form &#x60;$a$ is to $b$ what $c$ is to
$d$&#x27; in the general setting of universal algebra. This enables us to compare
mathematical objects possibly across different domains in a uniform way which
is crucial for AI-systems. The main idea is to define solutions to analogical
equations in terms of maximal sets of algebraic justifications, which amounts
to deriving abstract terms of concrete elements from a &#x60;known&#x27; source domain
which can then be instantiated in an &#x60;unknown&#x27; target domain to obtain
analogous elements. It turns out that our notion of analogical proportions has
appealing mathematical properties. We compare our framework with two recently
introduced frameworks of analogical proportions from the literature in the
concrete domains of sets and numbers, and we show that in each case we either
disagree with the notion from the literature justified by some counter-example
or we can show that our model yields strictly more solutions. As we construct
our model from first principles using only elementary concepts of universal
algebra, and since our model questions some basic properties of analogical
proportions presupposed in the literature, to convince the reader of the
plausibility of our model we show that it can be naturally embedded into
first-order logic via model-theoretic types, and prove that analogical
proportions are compatible with structure-preserving mappings from that
perspective. This provides strong evidence for its applicability. In a broader
sense, this paper is a first step towards a theory of analogical reasoning and
learning systems with potential applications to fundamental AI-problems like
commonsense reasoning and computational learning and creativity.</span>

adversarial training brings much computational overhead compared with standard
training. In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose an annealing
mechanism, Amata, to reduce the overhead associated with adversarial training.
The proposed Amata is provably convergent, well-motivated from the lens of
optimal control theory and can be combined with existing acceleration methods
to further enhance performance. It is demonstrated that on standard datasets,
Amata can achieve similar or better robustness with around 1/3 to 1/2 the
computational time compared with traditional methods. In addition, Amata can be
incorporated into other adversarial training acceleration algorithms (e.g.
YOPO, Free, Fast, and ATTA), which leads to further reduction in computational
time on large-scale problems.</span>

market, more and more logistics and transportation companies start to deploy
EVs for service provision. In order to model the operations of a commercial EV
fleet, we utilize the EV routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW). In this
research, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework to
solve the EVRPTW. In particular, we develop an attention model incorporating
the pointer network and a graph embedding technique to parameterize a
stochastic policy for solving the EVRPTW. The model is then trained using
policy gradient with rollout baseline. Our numerical studies show that the
proposed model is able to efficiently solve EVRPTW instances of large sizes

attention in recent years due to its applicability in a wide range of fields
from machine learning to game theory. Specifically, we study the online
optimization of mixable loss functions in a dynamic environment. We introduce
online mixture schemes that asymptotically achieves the performance of the best
dynamic estimation sequence of the switching oracle with optimal regret
redundancies. The best dynamic estimation sequence that we compete against is
selected in hindsight with full observation of the loss functions and is
allowed to select different optimal estimations in different time intervals
(segments). We propose two mixtures in our work. Firstly, we propose a
tractable polynomial time complexity algorithm that can achieve the optimal
redundancy of the intractable brute force approach. Secondly, we propose an
efficient logarithmic time complexity algorithm that can achieve the optimal

embeddings based on time-ordered item purchasing sequences, which is defined as
Sequential Recommendation (SR) problem. Existing methods leverage sequential
patterns to model item transitions. However, most of them ignore crucial
temporal collaborative signals, which are latent in evolving user-item
interactions and coexist with sequential patterns. Therefore, we propose to
unify sequential patterns and temporal collaborative signals to improve the
quality of recommendation, which is rather challenging. Firstly, it is hard to
simultaneously encode sequential patterns and collaborative signals. Secondly,
it is non-trivial to express the temporal effects of collaborative signals.

Hence, we design a new framework Temporal Graph Sequential Recommender
(TGSRec) upon our defined continuous-time bi-partite graph. We propose a novel
Temporal Collaborative Trans-former (TCT) layer in TGSRec, which advances the
self-attention mechanism by adopting a novel collaborative attention. TCT layer
can simultaneously capture collaborative signals from both users and items, as
well as considering temporal dynamics inside sequential patterns. We propagate
the information learned fromTCTlayerover the temporal graph to unify sequential
patterns and temporal collaborative signals. Empirical results on five datasets
show that TGSRec significantly outperforms other baselines, in average up to
22.5% and 22.1%absolute improvements in Recall@10and MRR, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training is a powerful type of defense against adversarial
examples. Previous empirical results suggest that adversarial training requires
wider networks for better performances. However, it remains elusive how neural
network width affects model robustness. In this paper, we carefully examine the
relationship between network width and model robustness. Specifically, we show
that the model robustness is closely related to the tradeoff between natural
accuracy and perturbation stability, which is controlled by the robust
regularization parameter $\lambda$. With the same $\lambda$, wider networks can
achieve better natural accuracy but worse perturbation stability, leading to a
potentially worse overall model robustness. To understand the origin of this
phenomenon, we further relate the perturbation stability with the network&#x27;s
local Lipschitzness. By leveraging recent results on neural tangent kernels, we
theoretically show that wider networks tend to have worse perturbation
stability. Our analyses suggest that: 1) the common strategy of first
fine-tuning $\lambda$ on small networks and then directly use it for wide model
training could lead to deteriorated model robustness; 2) one needs to properly
enlarge $\lambda$ to unleash the robustness potential of wider models fully.
Finally, we propose a new Width Adjusted Regularization (WAR) method that
adaptively enlarges $\lambda$ on wide models and significantly saves the tuning
time.</span>

this direction by introducing the \emph{complex-reaction network} with

functions can be approximated by a complex-reaction network using the
polynomial number of parameters, whereas real-valued networks need at least
exponential parameters to reach the same approximation level. For empirical
risk minimization, our theoretical result shows that the critical point set of
complex-reaction networks is a proper subset of that of real-valued networks,
which may show some insights on finding the optimal solutions more easily for
complex-reaction networks.</span>

is crucial for both explaining them and pursuing goal-directed interventions.
Inferring these factors from time series data without supervision remains an
open challenge. Here, we focus on spatiotemporal processes, including wave
propagation and weather dynamics, for which we assume that universal causes
(e.g. physics) apply throughout space and time. A recently introduced
DIstributed SpatioTemporal graph Artificial Neural network Architecture
(DISTANA) is used and enhanced to learn such processes, requiring fewer
parameters and achieving significantly more accurate predictions compared to
temporal convolutional neural networks and other related approaches. We show
that DISTANA, when combined with a retrospective latent state inference
principle called active tuning, can reliably derive location-respective hidden
causal factors. In a current weather prediction benchmark, DISTANA infers our
planet&#x27;s land-sea mask solely by observing temperature dynamics and, meanwhile,
uses the self inferred information to improve its own future temperature

is susceptible to overfit the sequential dependencies instead of accounting for
complex transitions between items in different sessions. We propose using a

                                        <span>We investigate the potential of stochastic neural networks for learning
effective waveform-based acoustic models. The waveform-based setting, inherent
to fully end-to-end speech recognition systems, is motivated by several
comparative studies of automatic and human speech recognition that associate
standard non-adaptive feature extraction techniques with information loss which
can adversely affect robustness. Stochastic neural networks, on the other hand,
are a class of models capable of incorporating rich regularization mechanisms
into the learning process. We consider a deep convolutional neural network that
first decomposes speech into frequency sub-bands via an adaptive parametric
convolutional block where filters are specified by cosine modulations of
compactly supported windows. The network then employs standard non-parametric
1D convolutions to extract relevant spectro-temporal patterns while gradually
compressing the structured high dimensional representation generated by the
parametric block. We rely on a probabilistic parametrization of the proposed
neural architecture and learn the model using stochastic variational inference.
This requires evaluation of an analytically intractable integral defining the
Kullback-Leibler divergence term responsible for regularization, for which we
propose an effective approximation based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Our
empirical results demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed approach
over comparable waveform-based baselines and indicate that it could lead to
robustness. Moreover, the approach outperforms a recently proposed deep
convolutional neural network for learning of robust acoustic models with
standard FBANK features.</span>

numerous safety-critical computer vision applications, including human robot
interactions and automated driving. Real-world implementations will need to
guarantee their robustness against hardware soft errors corrupting the
underlying platform memory. Based on the previously observed efficacy of
activation clipping techniques, we build a prototypical safety case for
classifier CNNs by demonstrating that range supervision represents a highly
reliable fault detector and mitigator with respect to relevant bit flips,
adopting an eight-exponent floating point data representation. We further
explore novel, non-uniform range restriction methods that effectively suppress
the probability of silent data corruptions and uncorrectable errors. As a
safety-relevant end-to-end use case, we showcase the benefit of our approach in
a vehicle classification scenario, using ResNet-50 and the traffic camera data
set MIOVision. The quantitative evidence provided in this work can be leveraged
to inspire further and possibly more complex CNN safety arguments.</span>

industrial sectors such as economic, business and management among others. This
paper presents a new model for wind speed prediction based on Graph Attention
Networks (GAT). In particular, the proposed model extends GAT architecture by
equipping it with a learnable adjacency matrix as well as incorporating a new
attention mechanism with the aim of obtaining attention scores per weather
variable. The output of the GAT based model is combined with the LSTM layer in
order to exploit both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the
multivariate multidimensional historical weather data. Real weather data
collected from several cities in Denmark and Netherlands are used to conduct
the experiments and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. We show
that in comparison to previous architectures used for wind speed prediction,
the proposed model is able to better learn the complex input-output
relationships of the weather data. Furthermore, thanks to the learned attention
weights, the model provides an additional insights on the most important
weather variables and cities for the studied prediction task.</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models are proven to be a useful tool for automatic design
synthesis and design space exploration. When applied in engineering design,
existing generative models face three challenges: 1) generated designs lack
diversity and do not cover all areas of the design space, 2) it is difficult to
explicitly improve the overall performance or quality of generated designs, and
3) existing models generally do not generate novel designs, outside the domain
of the training data. In this paper, we simultaneously address these challenges
by proposing a new Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for
probabilistic modeling of diversity and quality. With this new loss function,
we develop a variant of the Generative Adversarial Network, named &quot;Performance
Augmented Diverse Generative Adversarial Network&quot; or PaDGAN, which can generate
novel high-quality designs with good coverage of the design space. Using three
synthetic examples and one real-world airfoil design example, we demonstrate
that PaDGAN can generate diverse and high-quality designs. In comparison to a
vanilla Generative Adversarial Network, on average, it generates samples with a
28% higher mean quality score with larger diversity and without the mode
collapse issue. Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new
designs by interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that
PaDGAN expands the design space boundary outside the training data towards
high-quality regions. The proposed method is broadly applicable to many tasks
including design space exploration, design optimization, and creative solution
recommendation.</span>

                                        <span>To discover powerful yet compact models is an important goal of neural
architecture search. Previous two-stage one-shot approaches are limited by
search space with a fixed depth. It seems handy to include an additional skip
connection in the search space to make depths variable. However, it creates a
large range of perturbation during supernet training and it has difficulty
giving a confident ranking for subnetworks. In this paper, we discover that
skip connections bring about significant feature inconsistency compared with
other operations, which potentially degrades the supernet performance. Based on
this observation, we tackle the problem by imposing an equivariant learnable
stabilizer to homogenize such disparities. Experiments show that our proposed
stabilizer helps to improve the supernet&#x27;s convergence as well as ranking
performance. With an evolutionary search backend that incorporates the
stabilized supernet as an evaluator, we derive a family of state-of-the-art
architectures, the SCARLET series of several depths, especially SCARLET-A
obtains 76.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code is available at

                                        <span>Diabetes prediction is an important data science application in the social
healthcare domain. There exist two main challenges in the diabetes prediction
task: data heterogeneity since demographic and metabolic data are of different
types, data insufficiency since the number of diabetes cases in a single
medical center is usually limited. To tackle the above challenges, we employ
gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and
introduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency. To this end,
Task-wise Split Gradient Boosting Trees (TSGB) is proposed for the multi-center
diabetes prediction task. Specifically, we firstly introduce task gain to
evaluate each task separately during tree construction, with a theoretical
analysis of GBDT&#x27;s learning objective. Secondly, we reveal a problem when
directly applying GBDT in MTL, i.e., the negative task gain problem. Finally,
we propose a novel split method for GBDT in MTL based on the task gain
statistics, named task-wise split, as an alternative to standard feature-wise
split to overcome the mentioned negative task gain problem. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale real-world diabetes dataset and a commonly used
benchmark dataset demonstrate TSGB achieves superior performance against
several state-of-the-art methods. Detailed case studies further support our
analysis of negative task gain problems and provide insightful findings. The
proposed TSGB method has been deployed as an online diabetes risk assessment
software for early diagnosis.</span>

                                        <span>Vehicle counting systems can help with vehicle analysis and traffic incident
detection. Unfortunately, most existing methods require some level of human
input to identify the Region of interest (ROI), movements of interest, or to
establish a reference point or line to count vehicles from traffic cameras.
This work introduces a method to count vehicles from traffic videos that
automatically identifies the ROI for the camera, as well as the driving
trajectories of the vehicles. This makes the method feasible to use with
Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras, which are frequently used in developing countries.
Preliminary results indicate that the proposed method achieves an average
intersection over the union of 57.05% for the ROI and a mean absolute error of
just 17.44% at counting vehicles of the traffic video cameras tested.</span>

mobile application, CITISEN, which can perform three functions: speech
enhancement (SE), acoustic scene conversion (ASC), and model adaptation (MA).
For SE, CITISEN can effectively reduce noise components from speech signals and
accordingly enhance their clarity and intelligibility. For ASC, CITISEN can
convert the current background sound to a different background sound. Finally,
for MA, CITISEN can effectively adapt an SE model, with a few audio files, when
it encounters unknown speakers or noise types; the adapted SE model is used to
enhance the upcoming noisy utterances. Experimental results confirmed the
effectiveness of CITISEN in performing these three functions via objective
evaluation and subjective listening tests. The promising results reveal that
the developed CITISEN mobile application can potentially be used as a front-end
processor for various speech-related services such as voice communication,
assistive hearing devices, and virtual reality headsets.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot speaker adaptation is a specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that
aims to reproduce a novel speaker&#x27;s voice with a few training data. While
numerous attempts have been made to the few-shot speaker adaptation system,
there is still a gap in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker
depending on the amount of data. To bridge the gap, we propose GC-TTS which
achieves high-quality speaker adaptation with significantly improved speaker
similarity. Specifically, we leverage two geometric constraints to learn
discriminative speaker representations. Here, a TTS model is pre-trained for
base speakers with a sufficient amount of data, and then fine-tuned for novel
speakers on a few minutes of data with two geometric constraints. Two geometric
constraints enable the model to extract discriminative speaker embeddings from
limited data, which leads to the synthesis of intelligible speech. We discuss
and verify the effectiveness of GC-TTS by comparing it with popular and
essential methods. The experimental results demonstrate that GC-TTS generates
high-quality speech from only a few minutes of training data, outperforming
standard techniques in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker.</span>

robust against Byzantine worker machines. We propose and analyze a distributed
gradient-descent algorithm that performs a simple thresholding based on
gradient norms to mitigate Byzantine failures. We show the (statistical)
error-rate of our algorithm matches that of Yin et al.~\cite{dong}, which uses
more complicated schemes (coordinate-wise median, trimmed mean). Furthermore,
for communication efficiency, we consider a generic class of
$\delta$-approximate compressors from Karimireddi et al.~\cite{errorfeed} that
encompasses sign-based compressors and top-$k$ sparsification. Our algorithm
uses compressed gradients and gradient norms for aggregation and Byzantine
removal respectively. We establish the statistical error rate for non-convex
smooth loss functions. We show that, in certain range of the compression factor
$\delta$, the (order-wise) rate of convergence is not affected by the
compression operation. Moreover, we analyze the compressed gradient descent
algorithm with error feedback (proposed in \cite{errorfeed}) in a distributed
setting and in the presence of Byzantine worker machines. We show that
exploiting error feedback improves the statistical error rate. Finally, we
experimentally validate our results and show good performance in convergence

algorithms for which RL agents behave following a (soft)-greedy policy w.r.t.
to $Q$. It is a powerful tool that allows action selection without a model of
the environment and even without explicitly modeling the policy. Yet, this
scheme can only be used in discrete action tasks, with small numbers of
actions, as the softmax cannot be computed exactly otherwise. Especially the
usage of function approximation, to deal with continuous action spaces in
modern actor-critic architectures, intrinsically prevents the exact computation
of a softmax. We propose to alleviate this issue by parametrizing the
$Q$-function implicitly, as the sum of a log-policy and of a value function. We
use the resulting parametrization to derive a practical off-policy deep RL
algorithm, suitable for large action spaces, and that enforces the softmax
relation between the policy and the $Q$-value. We provide a theoretical
analysis of our algorithm: from an Approximate Dynamic Programming perspective,
we show its equivalence to a regularized version of value iteration, accounting
for both entropy and Kullback-Leibler regularization, and that enjoys
beneficial error propagation results. We then evaluate our algorithm on classic

                                        <span>We propose a novel interpretable deep neural network for text classification,
called ProtoryNet, based on a new concept of prototype trajectories. Motivated
by the prototype theory in modern linguistics, ProtoryNet makes a prediction by
finding the most similar prototype for each sentence in a text sequence and
feeding an RNN backbone with the proximity of each sentence to the
corresponding active prototype. The RNN backbone then captures the temporal
pattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.
Prototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the
reasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.
We also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of
prototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on
multiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the
baseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap
compared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype
pruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20
prototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.
Furthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find
ProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based
methods.</span>

                                        <span>We contribute HAA500, a manually annotated human-centric atomic action
dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591K labeled frames. To
minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly
diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent
actions fall under the same label, e.g., &quot;Baseball Pitching&quot; vs &quot;Free Throw in
Basketball&quot;. Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets,
where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such
as &quot;Throw&quot;. HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement
of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label
noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a
high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high
scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3)
curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without
irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive
experiments including cross-data validation using datasets collected in the
wild demonstrate the clear benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics
of HAA500, which enable training even a baseline deep learning model to improve
prediction by attending to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset
statistics and collection methodology and compare quantitatively with existing
action recognition datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Failure trajectories, identifying the probable failure zones, and damage
statistics are some of the key quantities of relevance in brittle fracture
applications. High-fidelity numerical solvers that reliably estimate these
relevant quantities exist but they are computationally demanding requiring a
high resolution of the crack. Moreover, independent intensive simulations need
to be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material
properties. Therefore, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to
alleviate the computational burden but the discontinuous nature of fracture
mechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models. We propose a
physics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle
fracture analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of
the defect to the relevant fields of interests (e.g., damage and displacement
fields). Once the network is trained, the entire global solution can be rapidly
obtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain.
While the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to
train the V-DeepONet by imposing the governing equations in variational form
and we also use some labelled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
V-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture, and we verify its
accuracy using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws
and also some data to train the network renders the surrogate model capable of
accurately performing both interpolation and extrapolation tasks, considering
that fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations. The proposed hybrid
training of V-DeepONet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can be
applied to a wide array of dynamical systems with complex responses.</span>

                                        <span>Generative models in molecular design tend to be richly parameterized,
data-hungry neural models, as they must create complex structured objects as
outputs. Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of
sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective
self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets.
We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property
predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for
filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets
are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to
maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A
simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples
since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We
demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and
conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in
absolute gain. Finally, we show that our approach is useful in other domains as
well, such as program synthesis.</span>

runtime future violations of a system from the current state. We work under the
most realistic settings where only partial and noisy observations of the state
are available at runtime. Such settings directly affect the accuracy and
reliability of the reachability predictions, jeopardizing the safety of the
system. In this work, we present a learning-based method for PM that produces
accurate and reliable reachability predictions despite partial observability
(PO). We build on Neural Predictive Monitoring (NPM), a PM method that uses
deep neural networks for approximating hybrid systems reachability, and extend
it to the PO case. We propose and compare two solutions, an end-to-end
approach, which directly operates on the rough observations, and a two-step
approach, which introduces an intermediate state estimation step. Both
solutions rely on conformal prediction to provide 1) probabilistic guarantees
in the form of prediction regions and 2) sound estimates of predictive
uncertainty. We use the latter to identify unreliable (and likely erroneous)
predictions and to retrain and improve the monitors on these uncertain inputs
(i.e., active learning). Our method results in highly accurate reachability
predictions and error detection, as well as tight prediction regions with
guaranteed coverage.</span>

                                        <span>Electromyography (EMG) refers to a biomedical signal indicating neuromuscular
activity and muscle morphology. Experts accurately diagnose neuromuscular
disorders using this time series. Modern data analysis techniques have recently
led to introducing novel approaches for mapping time series data to graphs and
complex networks with applications in diverse fields, including medicine. The
resulting networks develop a completely different visual acuity that can be
used to complement physician findings of time series. This can lead to a more
enriched analysis, reduced error, more accurate diagnosis of the disease, and
increased accuracy and speed of the treatment process. The mapping process may
cause the loss of essential data from the time series and not retain all the
time series features. As a result, achieving an approach that can provide a
good representation of the time series while maintaining essential features is
crucial. This paper proposes a new approach to network development named
GraphTS to overcome the limited accuracy of existing methods through EMG time
series using the visibility graph method. For this purpose, EMG signals are
pre-processed and mapped to a complex network by a standard visibility graph
algorithm. The resulting networks can differentiate between healthy and patient
samples. In the next step, the properties of the developed networks are given
in the form of a feature matrix as input to classifiers after extracting
optimal features. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with deep
neural network shows 99.30% accuracy for training data and 99.18% for test
data. Therefore, in addition to enriched network representation and covering
the features of time series for healthy, myopathy, and neuropathy EMG, the
proposed technique improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.</span>

                                        <span>Unscheduled power disturbances cause severe consequences both for customers
and grid operators. To defend against such events, it is necessary to identify
the causes of interruptions in the power distribution network. In this work, we
focus on the power grid of a Norwegian community in the Arctic that experiences
several faults whose sources are unknown. First, we construct a data set
consisting of relevant meteorological data and information about the current
power quality logged by power-quality meters. Then, we adopt machine-learning
techniques to predict the occurrence of faults. Experimental results show that
both linear and non-linear classifiers achieve good classification performance.
This indicates that the considered power-quality and weather variables explain
well the power disturbances. Interpreting the decision process of the
classifiers provides valuable insights to understand the main causes of
disturbances. Traditional features selection methods can only indicate which
are the variables that, on average, mostly explain the fault occurrences in the
dataset. Besides providing such a global interpretation, it is also important
to identify the specific set of variables that explain each individual fault.
To address this challenge, we adopt a recent technique to interpret the
decision process of a deep learning model, called Integrated Gradients. The
proposed approach allows to gain detailed insights on the occurrence of a
specific fault, which are valuable for the distribution system operators to
implement strategies to prevent and mitigate power disturbances.</span>

and quality of life. Monitoring stations have been established to continuously
obtain air quality information, but they do not cover all areas. Thus, there
are numerous methods for spatially fine-grained air quality inference. Since
existing methods aim to infer air quality of locations only in monitored
cities, they do not assume inferring air quality in unmonitored cities. In this
paper, we first study the air quality inference in unmonitored cities. To
accurately infer air quality in unmonitored cities, we propose a neural
network-based approach AIREX. The novelty of AIREX is employing a
mixture-of-experts approach, which is a machine learning technique based on the
divide-and-conquer principle, to learn correlations of air quality between
multiple cities. To further boost the performance, it employs attention
mechanisms to compute impacts of air quality inference from the monitored
cities to the locations in the unmonitored city. We show, through experiments
on a real-world air quality dataset, that AIREX achieves higher accuracy than

                                        <span>Biology is both an important application area and a source of motivation for
development of advanced machine learning techniques. Although much attention
has been paid to large and complex data sets resulting from high-throughput
sequencing, advances in high-quality video recording technology have begun to
generate similarly rich data sets requiring sophisticated techniques from both
computer vision and time-series analysis. Moreover, just as studying gene
expression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to
other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally
tractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general
principles about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one
such example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory
colonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially
induced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the
conclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains
unclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the
process. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of
One-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant
colonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal
conditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector
Data Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN)
that synthesizes fake &quot;inner outlier&quot; observations during training that are
near the center of the DSVDD data description. We show that IO-GEN increases
the reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines.
This method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human
observation is needed.</span>

                                        <span>A collaborative task is assigned to a multiagent system (MAS) in which agents
are allowed to communicate. The MAS runs over an underlying Markov decision
process and its task is to maximize the averaged sum of discounted one-stage
rewards. Although knowing the global state of the environment is necessary for
the optimal action selection of the MAS, agents are limited to individual
observations. Inter-agent communication can tackle the issue of local
observability, however, the limited rate of inter-agent communication prevents
the agents from acquiring the precise global state information. To overcome
this challenge, agents need to communicate an abstract version of their
observations to each other such that the MAS compromises the minimum possible
sum of rewards. We show that this problem is equivalent to a form of
rate-distortion problem, which we call task-based information compression
(TBIC). We introduce state aggregation for information compression (SAIC) to
solve the TBIC problem. SAIC is shown to achieve near-optimal performance in
terms of the achieved sum of discounted rewards. The proposed algorithm is
applied to a rendezvous problem and its performance is compared with several
benchmarks. Numerical experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed
algorithm.</span>

neural networks (CNNs) over the past few decades, they can easily reach or even
exceed the performance of humans in certain tasks. However, a recently
discovered shortcoming of CNNs is that they are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Although the adversarial robustness of CNNs can be improved by
adversarial training, there is a trade-off between standard accuracy and
adversarial robustness. From the neural architecture perspective, this paper
aims to improve the adversarial robustness of the backbone CNNs that have a
satisfactory accuracy. Under a minimal computational overhead, the introduction
of a dilation architecture is expected to be friendly with the standard
performance of the backbone CNN while pursuing adversarial robustness.
Theoretical analyses on the standard and adversarial error bounds naturally
motivate the proposed neural architecture dilation algorithm. Experimental
results on real-world datasets and benchmark neural networks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to balance the accuracy and adversarial
robustness.</span>

lack the tensor representation and mostly the element-wise max/mean function is

present a novel approach for global feature aggregation in Graph Neural

are sorted/distributed on the LFDS and a latent neural network (CNN/GNN) is
utilized to perform feature aggregation on the LFDS. The proposed approach is
used to design several novel global feature aggregation methods based on the

(image), sequence, data driven graphs and an algorithm which sorts/distributes
the extracted local feature vectors on the LFDS. While the computational
complexity of the proposed methods are linear with the order of input graphs,
they achieve competitive or better results.</span>

robustness, no comprehensive open-source toolbox currently exists to assist
researchers and practitioners in this important topic. This lack of available

new research, and dissemination of new ideas. We contribute TIGER, an

graph robustness measures with both original and fast approximate versions; 17
failure and attack strategies; 15 heuristic and optimization-based defense
techniques; and 4 simulation tools. By democratizing the tools required to

in analyzing their own networks; and facilitate the development of new research
in the field. TIGER has been integrated into the Nvidia Data Science Teaching

                                        <span>Detecting drifts in data is essential for machine learning applications, as
changes in the statistics of processed data typically has a profound influence
on the performance of trained models. Most of the available drift detection
methods require access to true labels during inference time. In a real-world
scenario, true labels usually available only during model training. In this
work, we propose a novel task-sensitive drift detection framework, which is
able to detect drifts without access to true labels during inference. It
utilizes metric learning of a constrained low-dimensional embedding
representation of the input data, which is best suited for the classification
task. It is able to detect real drift, where the drift affects the
classification performance, while it properly ignores virtual drift, where the
classification performance is not affected by the drift. In the proposed
framework, the actual method to detect a change in the statistics of incoming
data samples can be chosen freely. We also propose the two change detection
methods, which are based on the exponential moving average and a modified
$z$-score, respectively. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework
with a novel metric, which accumulates the standard metrics of detection
accuracy, false positive rate and detection delay into one value. Experimental
evaluation on nine benchmarks datasets, with different types of drift,
demonstrates that the proposed framework can reliably detect drifts, and
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised drift detection approaches.</span>

local gradients or parameters rather than raw data, the adversary still can
leverage local gradients and parameters to obtain local training data by
launching reconstruction and membership inference attacks. To defend such
privacy attacks, many noises perturbation methods (like differential privacy or
CountSketch matrix) have been widely designed. However, the strong defence
ability and high learning accuracy of these schemes cannot be ensured at the
same time, which will impede the wide application of FL in practice (especially
for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and
strong privacy guarantee). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose
\emph{an efficient model perturbation method for federated learning} to defend
reconstruction and membership inference attacks launched by curious clients. On
the one hand, similar to the differential privacy, our method also selects
random numbers as perturbed noises added to the global model parameters, and
thus it is very efficient and easy to be integrated in practice. Meanwhile, the
random selected noises are positive real numbers and the corresponding value
can be arbitrarily large, and thus the strong defence ability can be ensured.
On the other hand, unlike differential privacy or other perturbation methods
that cannot eliminate the added noises, our method allows the server to recover

                                        <span>Vertical federated learning (VFL) leverages various privacy-preserving
algorithms, e.g., homomorphic encryption or secret sharing based SecureBoost,
to ensure data privacy. However, these algorithms all require a semi-honest
secure definition, which raises concerns in real-world applications. In this
paper, we present Aegis, a trusted, automatic, and accurate verification
framework to verify the security of VFL jobs. Aegis is separated from local
parties to ensure the security of the framework. Furthermore, it automatically
adapts to evolving VFL algorithms by defining the VFL job as a finite state
machine to uniformly verify different algorithms and reproduce the entire job
to provide more accurate verification. We implement and evaluate Aegis with
different threat models on financial and medical datasets. Evaluation results
show that: 1) Aegis can detect 95% threat models, and 2) it provides
fine-grained verification results within 84% of the total VFL job time.</span>

                                        <span>Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is an efficient approach for the
control of nonlinear multivariable dynamic systems with constraints, which
however requires an accurate plant model. Plant models can often be determined
from first principles, parts of the model are however difficult to derive using
physical laws alone. In this paper a hybrid Gaussian process (GP) first
principles modeling scheme is proposed to overcome this issue, which exploits
GPs to model the parts of the dynamic system that are difficult to describe
using first principles. GPs not only give accurate predictions, but also
quantify the residual uncertainty of this model. It is vital to account for
this uncertainty in the control algorithm, to prevent constraint violations and
performance deterioration. Monte Carlo samples of the GPs are generated offline
to tighten constraints of the NMPC to ensure joint probabilistic constraint
satisfaction online. Advantages of our method include fast online evaluation
times, possibility to account for online learning alleviating conservativeness,
and exploiting the flexibility of GPs and the data efficiency of first
principle models. The algorithm is verified on a case study involving a
challenging semi-batch bioreactor.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL) emerged as a promising learning paradigm to enable a
multitude of participants to construct a joint ML model without exposing their
private training data. Existing FL designs have been shown to exhibit
vulnerabilities which can be exploited by adversaries both within and outside
of the system to compromise data privacy. However, most current works conduct
attacks by leveraging gradients on a small batch of data, which is less
practical in FL. In this work, we consider a more practical and interesting
scenario in which participants share their epoch-averaged gradients (share
gradients after at least 1 epoch of local training) rather than per-example or
small batch-averaged gradients as in previous works. We perform the first
systematic evaluation of attribute reconstruction attack (ARA) launched by the
malicious server in the FL system, and empirically demonstrate that the shared
epoch-averaged local model gradients can reveal sensitive attributes of local
training data of any victim participant. To achieve this goal, we develop a
more effective and efficient gradient matching based method called cos-matching
to reconstruct the training data attributes. We evaluate our attacks on a
variety of real-world datasets, scenarios, assumptions. Our experiments show
that our proposed method achieves better attribute attack performance than most
existing baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks (NNs) are widely used for classification tasks for their
remarkable performance. However, the robustness and accuracy of NNs heavily
depend on the training data. In many applications, massive training data is
usually not available. To address the challenge, this paper proposes an
iterative adversarial data augmentation (IADA) framework to learn neural
network models from an insufficient amount of training data. The method uses
formal verification to identify the most &quot;confusing&quot; input samples, and
leverages human guidance to safely and iteratively augment the training data
with these samples. The proposed framework is applied to an artificial 2D
dataset, the MNIST dataset, and a human motion dataset. By applying IADA to
fully-connected NN classifiers, we show that our training method can improve
the robustness and accuracy of the learned model. By comparing to regular
supervised training, on the MNIST dataset, the average perturbation bound
improved 107.4%. The classification accuracy improved 1.77%, 3.76%, 10.85% on
the 2D dataset, the MNIST dataset, and the human motion dataset respectively.</span>

each player experiences total regret that is ${\rm poly}(\log T)$. Our bound
improves, exponentially, the $O({T}^{1/2})$ regret attainable by standard

                                        <span>Considering how congestion will propagate in the near future, understanding
traffic congestion propagation has become crucial in GPS navigation systems for
providing users with a more accurate estimated time of arrival (ETA). However,
providing the exact ETA during congestion is a challenge owing to the complex
propagation process between roads and high uncertainty regarding the future
behavior of the process. Recent studies have focused on finding frequent
congestion propagation patterns and determining the propagation probabilities.
By contrast, this study proposes a novel time delay estimation method for
traffic congestion propagation between roads using lag-specific transfer
entropy (TE). Nonlinear normalization with a sliding window is used to
effectively reveal the causal relationship between the source and target time
series in calculating the TE. Moreover, Markov bootstrap techniques were
adopted to quantify the uncertainty in the time delay estimator. To the best of
our knowledge, the time delay estimation method presented in this article is
the first to determine the time delay between roads for any congestion
propagation pattern. The proposed method was validated using simulated data as
well as real user trajectory data obtained from a major GPS navigation system
applied in South Korea.</span>

perturbations contribute to the attacking task. We estimate attributions of
different image regions to the decrease of the attacking cost based on the
Shapley value. We define and quantify interactions among adversarial
perturbation pixels, and decompose the entire perturbation map into relatively
independent perturbation components. The decomposition of the perturbation map
shows that adversarially-trained DNNs have more perturbation components in the
foreground than normally-trained DNNs. Moreover, compared to the
normally-trained DNN, the adversarially-trained DNN have more components which
mainly decrease the score of the true category. Above analyses provide new

algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness by experiments on both synthetic
and real datasets. We also analyze the proposed algorithms from the theoretical
aspect and obtain almost tight regret-batches tradeoffs for the two-arm case.</span>

                                        <span>Actor-critic (AC) algorithms are known for their efficacy and high
performance in solving reinforcement learning problems, but they also suffer
from low sampling efficiency. An AC based policy optimization process is
iterative and needs to frequently access the agent-environment system to
evaluate and update the policy by rolling out the policy, collecting rewards
and states (i.e. samples), and learning from them. It ultimately requires a
huge number of samples to learn an optimal policy. To improve sampling
efficiency, we propose a strategy to optimize the training dataset that
contains significantly less samples collected from the AC process. The dataset
optimization is made of a best episode only operation, a policy
parameter-fitness model, and a genetic algorithm module. The optimal policy
network trained by the optimized training dataset exhibits superior performance
compared to many contemporary AC algorithms in controlling autonomous dynamical
systems. Evaluation on standard benchmarks show that the method improves
sampling efficiency, ensures faster convergence to optima, and is more
data-efficient than its counterparts.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate automatic liver and tumor segmentation plays a vital role in
treatment planning and disease monitoring. Recently, deep convolutional neural
network (DCNNs) has obtained tremendous success in 2D and 3D medical image
segmentation. However, 2D DCNNs cannot fully leverage the inter-slice
information, while 3D DCNNs are computationally expensive and memory intensive.
To address these issues, we first propose a novel dense-sparse training flow
from a data perspective, in which, densely adjacent slices and sparsely
adjacent slices are extracted as inputs for regularizing DCNNs, thereby
improving the model performance. Moreover, we design a 2.5D light-weight
nnU-Net from a network perspective, in which, depthwise separable convolutions
are adopted to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on the LiTS

distress especially during disasters. Because posts made through it are
publicly accessible by default, Twitter is among the most helpful social media
sites in times of disaster. With this, the study aims to assess the needs

classified as either disaster-related or unrelated with the use of Na\&quot;ive

disaster type using Incremental Clustering Algorithm, and then sub-clustered
based on the location and time of the tweet using Density-based Spatiotemporal
Clustering Algorithm. Lastly, using Support Vector Machines, the tweets were
classified according to the expressed need, such as shelter, rescue, relief,
cash, prayer, and others. After conducting the study, results showed that the
Incremental Clustering Algorithm and Density-Based Spatiotemporal Clustering
Algorithm were able to cluster the tweets with f-measure scores of 47.20% and

machine learning (ML) has garnered immense interest in the research community.
However, these ML models turn out to be black boxes, which are tough to
interpret, resulting in a direct decrease in productivity. Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular technique for explaining the
prediction of a single instance. Although LIME is simple and versatile, it
suffers from instability in the generated explanations. In this paper, we
propose a Gaussian Process (GP) based variation of locally interpretable
models. We employ a smart sampling strategy based on the acquisition functions
in Bayesian optimization. Further, we employ the automatic relevance
determination based covariance function in GP, with separate length-scale
parameters for each feature, where the reciprocal of lengthscale parameters
serve as feature explanations. We illustrate the performance of the proposed
technique on two real-world datasets, and demonstrate the superior stability of
the proposed technique. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed technique
is able to generate faithful explanations using much fewer samples as compared
to LIME.</span>

automatically editing source code. Typical NMT based code editor only considers
the code that needs to be changed as input and suggests developers with a
ranked list of patched code to choose from - where the correct one may not
always be at the top of the list. While NMT based code editing systems generate
a broad spectrum of plausible patches, the correct one depends on the
developers&#x27; requirement and often on the context where the patch is applied.
Thus, if developers provide some hints, using natural language, or providing
patch context, NMT models can benefit from them. As a proof of concept, in this
research, we leverage three modalities of information: edit location, edit code
context, commit messages (as a proxy of developers&#x27; hint in natural language)
to automatically generate edits with NMT models. To that end, we build MODIT, a
multi-modal NMT based code editing engine. With in-depth investigation and
analysis, we show that developers&#x27; hint as an input modality can narrow the
search space for patches and outperform state-of-the-art models to generate

describes the ability to learn several tasks sequentially without catastrophic
forgetting (CF). Recent works indicate that CL is a complex topic, even more so
when real-world scenarios with multiple constraints are involved. Several
solution classes have been proposed, of which so-called replay-based approaches
seem very promising due to their simplicity and robustness. Such approaches
store a subset of past samples in a dedicated memory for later processing:
while this does not solve all problems, good results have been obtained. In
this article, we empirically investigate replay-based approaches of continual
learning and assess their potential for applications. Selected recent
approaches as well as own proposals are compared on a common set of benchmarks,
with a particular focus on assessing the performance of different sample
selection strategies. We find that the impact of sample selection increases
when a smaller number of samples is stored. Nevertheless, performance varies
strongly between different replay approaches. Surprisingly, we find that the
most naive rehearsal-based approaches that we propose here can outperform
recent state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for brain tumor diagnosis,
treatment planning, and post-treatment surveillance. Recently, various models
based on deep neural networks have been proposed for the pixel-level
segmentation of tumors in brain MRIs. However, the structural variations,
spatial dissimilarities, and intensity inhomogeneity in MRIs make segmentation
a challenging task. We propose a new end-to-end brain tumor segmentation
architecture based on U-Net that integrates Inception modules and dilated
convolutions into its contracting and expanding paths. This allows us to
extract local structural as well as global contextual information. We performed
segmentation of glioma sub-regions, including tumor core, enhancing tumor, and
whole tumor using Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 dataset. Our proposed
model performed significantly better than the state-of-the-art U-Net-based
model ($p&lt;0.05$) for tumor core and whole tumor segmentation.</span>

networks (DNNs) have an inherent vulnerability to small perturbations. Applying
the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN) classifier, we observe a dramatically
increasing robustness-accuracy trade-off as the layer goes deeper. In this
work, we propose a Deep Adversarially-Enhanced k-Nearest Neighbors (DAEkNN)
method which achieves higher robustness than DkNN and mitigates the
robustness-accuracy trade-off in deep layers through two key elements. First,
DAEkNN is based on an adversarially trained model. Second, DAEkNN makes
predictions by leveraging a weighted combination of benign and adversarial
training data. Empirically, we find that DAEkNN improves both the robustness

                                        <span>Graph structured data have enabled several successful applications such as
recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and
edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order
adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data
holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder
will only own either the node features or edge information), different data
holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly
transfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on
the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features
will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency
information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint
information and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to
provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test
nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via
influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via
designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller
is able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming
existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an
existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP
GCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these
DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under
mild privacy guarantees ($\varepsilon&gt;5$). Our studies will shed light on
future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models;
in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN
model utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the impressive clustering performance and efficiency in
characterizing both the relationship between data and cluster structure,
existing graph-based multi-view clustering methods still have the following
drawbacks. They suffer from the expensive time burden due to both the
construction of graphs and eigen-decomposition of Laplacian matrix, and fail to
explore the cluster structure of large-scale data. Moreover, they require a
post-processing to get the final clustering, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, rank of the learned view-consensus graph cannot
approximate the target rank. In this paper, drawing the inspiration from the
bipartite graph, we propose an effective and efficient graph learning model for
multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits the view-similar
between graphs of different views by the minimization of tensor Schatten
p-norm, which well characterizes both the spatial structure and complementary
information embedded in graphs of different views. We learn view-consensus
graph with adaptively weighted strategy and connectivity constraint such that
the connected components indicates clusters directly. Our proposed algorithm is
time-economical and obtains the stable results and scales well with the data
size. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method is superior to
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

associated temporal difference (TD) methods for reinforcement learning in
continuous time and space. We show that PE is equivalent to maintaining the
martingale condition of a process. From this perspective, we find that the
mean--square TD error approximates the quadratic variation of the martingale
and thus is not a suitable objective for PE. We present two methods to use the
martingale characterization for designing PE algorithms. The first one
minimizes a &quot;martingale loss function&quot;, whose solution is proved to be the best
approximation of the true value function in the mean--square sense. This method
interprets the classical gradient Monte-Carlo algorithm. The second method is
based on a system of equations called the &quot;martingale orthogonality conditions&quot;
with &quot;test functions&quot;. Solving these equations in different ways recovers
various classical TD algorithms, such as TD($\lambda$), LSTD, and GTD.
Different choices of test functions determine in what sense the resulting
solutions approximate the true value function. Moreover, we prove that any
convergent time-discretized algorithm converges to its continuous-time
counterpart as the mesh size goes to zero. We demonstrate the theoretical
results and corresponding algorithms with numerical experiments and

place. In this competition, the players are provided with a real-world
city-scale road network and its traffic demand derived from real traffic data.
The players are asked to coordinate the traffic signals with a self-designed
agent to maximize the number of vehicles served while maintaining an acceptable
delay. In this abstract paper, we present an overall analysis and our detailed
solution to this competition. Our approach is mainly based on the adaptation of
the deep Q-network (DQN) for real-time traffic signal control. From our
perspective, the major challenge of this competition is how to extend the
classical DQN framework to traffic signals control in real-world complex road
network and traffic flow situation. After trying and implementing several
classical reward functions, we finally chose to apply our newly-designed reward
in our agent. By applying our newly-proposed reward function and carefully
tuning the control scheme, an agent based on a single DQN model can rank among
the top 15 teams. We hope this paper could serve, to some extent, as a baseline
solution to traffic signal control of real-world road network and inspire
further attempts and researches.</span>

collected from high-dimensional ambient space lie in a union of linear
subspaces. Subspace clustering becomes challenging when the dimension of
intersection between subspaces is large and most of the self-representation
based methods are sensitive to the intersection between the span of clusters.
In sharp contrast to the self-representation based methods, a recently proposed
clustering method termed Innovation Pursuit, computed a set of optimal
directions (directions of innovation) to build the adjacency matrix. This paper
focuses on the Innovation Pursuit Algorithm to shed light on its impressive
performance when the subspaces are heavily intersected. It is shown that in
contrast to most of the existing methods which require the subspaces to be
sufficiently incoherent with each other, Innovation Pursuit only requires the
innovative components of the subspaces to be sufficiently incoherent with each
other. These new sufficient conditions allow the clusters to be strongly close
to each other. Motivated by the presented theoretical analysis, a simple yet
effective projection based technique is proposed which we show with both
numerical and theoretical results that it can boost the performance of
Innovation Pursuit.</span>

engagement on these platforms via comments and reactions. A large portion of
such textual comments are abusive, rude and offensive to the audience. With
machine learning systems in-place to check such comments coming onto platform,
biases present in the training data gets passed onto the classifier leading to
discrimination against a set of classes, religion and gender. In this work, we
evaluate different classifiers and feature to estimate the bias in these
classifiers along with their performance on downstream task of toxicity
classification. Results show that improvement in performance of automatic toxic
comment detection models is positively correlated to mitigating biases in these
models. In our work, LSTM with attention mechanism proved to be a better
modelling strategy than a CNN model. Further analysis shows that fasttext
embeddings is marginally preferable than glove embeddings on training models
for toxicity comment detection. Deeper analysis reveals the findings that such
automatic models are particularly biased to specific identity groups even
though the model has a high AUC score. Finally, in effort to mitigate bias in
toxicity detection models, a multi-task setup trained with auxiliary task of

                                        <span>Due to the variety of cyber-attacks or threats, the cybersecurity community
has been enhancing the traditional security control mechanisms to an advanced
level so that automated tools can encounter potential security threats. Very
recently a term, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has been represented as one of
the proactive and robust mechanisms because of its automated cybersecurity
threat prediction based on data. In general, CTI collects and analyses data
from various sources e.g. online security forums, social media where cyber
enthusiasts, analysts, even cybercriminals discuss cyber or computer security
related topics and discovers potential threats based on the analysis. As the
manual analysis of every such discussion i.e. posts on online platforms is
time-consuming, inefficient, and susceptible to errors, CTI as an automated
tool can perform uniquely to detect cyber threats. In this paper, our goal is
to identify and explore relevant CTI from hacker forums by using different
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. To this end, we collect data
from a real hacker forum and constructed two datasets: a binary dataset and a
multi-class dataset. Our binary dataset contains two classes one containing
cybersecurity-relevant posts and another one containing posts that are not
related to security. This dataset is constructed using simple keyword search
technique. Using a similar approach, we further categorize posts from
security-relevant posts into five different threat categories. We then applied
several machine learning classifiers along with deep neural network-based
classifiers and use them on the datasets to compare their performances. We also
tested the classifiers on a leaked dataset with labels named nulled.io as our
ground truth. We further explore the datasets using unsupervised techniques
i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF).</span>

                                        <span>Accurate and timely estimation of precipitation is critical for issuing
hazard warnings (e.g., for flash floods or landslides). Current remotely sensed
precipitation products have a few hours of latency, associated with the
acquisition and processing of satellite data. By applying a robust nowcasting
system to these products, it is (in principle) possible to reduce this latency
and improve their applicability, value, and impact. However, the development of
such a system is complicated by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, and the
consequent rapid changes that can occur in the structures of precipitation
systems In this work, we develop two approaches (hereafter referred to as
Nowcasting-Nets) that use Recurrent and Convolutional deep neural network
structures to address the challenge of precipitation nowcasting. A total of
five models are trained using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated
Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data over the Eastern
Contiguous United States (CONUS) and then tested against independent data for
the Eastern and Western CONUS. The models were designed to provide forecasts
with a lead time of up to 1.5 hours and, by using a feedback loop approach, the
ability of the models to extend the forecast time to 4.5 hours was also
investigated. Model performance was compared against the Random Forest (RF) and
Linear Regression (LR) machine learning methods, and also against a persistence
benchmark (BM) that used the most recent observation as the forecast.
Independent IMERG observations were used as a reference, and experiments were
conducted to examine both overall statistics and case studies involving
specific precipitation events. Overall, the forecasts provided by the
Nowcasting-Net models are superior, with the Convolutional Nowcasting Network
with Residual Head (CNC-R) achieving 25%, 28%, and 46% improvement in the test

requirement for storing the neural networks. We also introduce representation
system - a countable collection of functions to guide neural networks, since
approximation theory with representation system has been well developed in
Mathematics. We then prove the fundamental bound theorem, implying a quantity

provides a method for transferring existing theories about approximation by
representation systems to that of neural networks, greatly amplifying the

to predict and simulate epidemic outbreaks, which can capture the impact of
individual behaviors on the macroscopic phenomenon. However, existing models
only consider simple rule-based individual behaviors, limiting their
applicability. This paper proposes a deep-reinforcement-learning-powered
microscopic model named Microscopic Pandemic Simulator (MPS). By replacing
rule-based agents with rational agents whose behaviors are driven to maximize
rewards, the MPS provides a better approximation of real world dynamics. To
efficiently simulate with massive amounts of agents in MPS, we propose Scalable
Million-Agent DQN (SMADQN). The MPS allows us to efficiently evaluate the
impact of different government strategies. This paper first calibrates the MPS
against real-world data in Allegheny, US, then demonstratively evaluates two
government strategies: information disclosure and quarantine. The results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a broad impact, this
paper provides novel insights for the application of DRL in large scale
agent-based networks such as economic and social networks.</span>

models such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). While prior work has focused on
generative methods for disentangled representation learning, these approaches
do not scale to large datasets due to current limitations of generative models.
Instead, we explore regularization methods with contrastive learning, which
could result in disentangled representations that are powerful enough for large
scale datasets and downstream applications. However, we find that unsupervised
disentanglement is difficult to achieve due to optimization and initialization
sensitivity, with trade-offs in task performance. We evaluate disentanglement
with downstream tasks, analyze the benefits and disadvantages of each
regularization used, and discuss future directions.</span>

                                        <span>Dropout Regularization, serving to reduce variance, is nearly ubiquitous in
Deep Learning models. We explore the relationship between the dropout rate and
model complexity by training 2,000 neural networks configured with random
combinations of the dropout rate and the number of hidden units in each dense
layer, on each of the three data sets we selected. The generated figures, with
binary cross entropy loss and binary accuracy on the z-axis, question the
common assumption that adding depth to a dense layer while increasing the
dropout rate will certainly enhance performance. We also discover a complex
correlation between the two hyperparameters that we proceed to quantify by
building additional machine learning and Deep Learning models which predict the
optimal dropout rate given some hidden units in each dense layer. Linear
regression and polynomial logistic regression require the use of arbitrary
thresholds to select the cost data points included in the regression and to
assign the cost data points a binary classification, respectively. These
machine learning models have mediocre performance because their naive nature
prevented the modeling of complex decision boundaries. Turning to Deep Learning
models, we build neural networks that predict the optimal dropout rate given
the number of hidden units in each dense layer, the desired cost, and the
desired accuracy of the model. Though, this attempt encounters a mathematical
error that can be attributed to the failure of the vertical line test. The
ultimate Deep Learning model is a neural network whose decision boundary
represents the 2,000 previously generated data points. This final model leads
us to devise a promising method for tuning hyperparameters to minimize
computational expense yet maximize performance. The strategy can be applied to
any model hyperparameters, with the prospect of more efficient tuning in
industrial models.</span>

                                        <span>Most recent studies on detecting and localizing temporal anomalies have
mainly employed deep neural networks to learn the normal patterns of temporal
data in an unsupervised manner. Unlike them, the goal of our work is to fully
utilize instance-level (or weak) anomaly labels, which only indicate whether
any anomalous events occurred or not in each instance of temporal data. In this
paper, we present WETAS, a novel framework that effectively identifies
anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input
instance. WETAS learns discriminative features from the instance-level labels
so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within
each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the
dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its
segmentation mask, WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and
simultaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional
supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other
baselines in terms of the localization of temporal anomalies, and also it
provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.</span>

                                        <span>This work presents an unsupervised deep learning scheme that exploiting
high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image
restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in
score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of
data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The
channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale
transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of
high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train
the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by
annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update.
Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional
representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance.
The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which
involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and
clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental
results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and
diversity of our proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>When faced with severely imbalanced binary classification problems, we often
train models on bootstrapped data in which the number of instances of each
class occur in a more favorable ratio, e.g., one. We view algorithmic inequity
through the lens of imbalanced classification: in order to balance the
performance of a classifier across groups, we can bootstrap to achieve training
sets that are balanced with respect to both labels and group identity. For an
example problem with severe class imbalance---prediction of suicide death from
administrative patient records---we illustrate how an equity-directed bootstrap
can bring test set sensitivities and specificities much closer to satisfying
the equal odds criterion. In the context of na\&quot;ive Bayes and logistic
regression, we analyze the equity-directed bootstrap, demonstrating that it
works by bringing odds ratios close to one, and linking it to methods involving
intercept adjustment, thresholding, and weighting.</span>

                                        <span>Community detection is a well-studied problem with applications in domains
ranging from computer networking to bioinformatics. While there are many
algorithms that perform community detection, the more accurate and
statistically robust algorithms tend to be slow and hard to parallelize. One
way to speed up such algorithms is through data reduction. However, this
approach has not been thoroughly studied, and the quality of results obtained
with this approach varies with the graph it is applied to. In this manuscript,
we present an approach based on topology-guided sampling for accelerating
stochastic block partitioning - a community detection algorithm that works well
on graphs with complex and heterogeneous community structure. We also introduce
a degree-based thresholding scheme that improves the efficacy of our approach
at the expense of speedup. Finally, we perform a series of experiments on
synthetically generated graphs to determine how various graph parameters affect
the quality of results and speedup obtained with our approach, and we validate
our approach on real-world data. Our results show that our approach can lead to
a speedup of up to 15X over stochastic block partitioning without sampling
while maintaining result quality and can even lead to improvements of over 150%
in result quality in terms of F1 score on certain kinds of graphs.</span>

                                        <span>As a special field in deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) focus on
extracting intrinsic network features and have drawn unprecedented popularity
in both academia and industry. Most of the state-of-the-art GNN models offer
expressive, robust, scalable and inductive solutions empowering social network
recommender systems with rich network features that are computationally
difficult to leverage with graph traversal based methods.

Most recent GNNs follow an encoder-decoder paradigm to encode high
dimensional heterogeneous information from a subgraph onto one low dimensional
embedding space. However, one single embedding space usually fails to capture
all aspects of graph signals. In this work, we propose boosting-based meta
learner for GNNs, which automatically learns multiple projections and the
corresponding embedding spaces that captures different aspects of the graph
signals. As a result, similarities between sub-graphs are quantified by
embedding proximity on multiple embedding spaces. AdaGNN performs exceptionally
well for applications with rich and diverse node neighborhood information.
Moreover, AdaGNN is compatible with any inductive GNNs for both node-level and
edge-level tasks.</span>

renewable energies outputs on microgrid operation, an optimal scheduling model
is proposed for isolated microgrids by using automated reinforcement
learning-based multi-period forecasting of renewable power generations and
loads. Firstly, a prioritized experience replay automated reinforcement
learning (PER-AutoRL) is designed to simplify the deployment of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based forecasting model in a customized manner,
the single-step multi-period forecasting method based on PER-AutoRL is proposed
for the first time to address the error accumulation issue suffered by existing
multi-step forecasting methods, then the prediction values obtained by the
proposed forecasting method are revised via the error distribution to improve
the prediction accuracy; secondly, a scheduling model considering demand
response is constructed to minimize the total microgrid operating costs, where
the revised forecasting values are used as the dispatch basis, and a spinning
reserve chance constraint is set according to the error distribution; finally,
by transforming the original scheduling model into a readily solvable mixed
integer linear programming via the sequence operation theory (SOT), the
transformed model is solved by using CPLEX solver. The simulation results show
that compared with the traditional scheduling model without forecasting, this
approach manages to significantly reduce the system operating costs by
improving the prediction accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Models with dominant advection always posed a difficult challenge for
projection-based reduced order modelling. Many methodologies that have recently
been proposed are based on the pre-processing of the full-order solutions to
accelerate the Kolmogorov N-width decay thereby obtaining smaller linear
subspaces with improved accuracy. These methods however must rely on the
knowledge of the characteristic speeds in phase space of the solution, limiting
their range of applicability to problems with explicit functional form for the
advection field. In this work we approach the problem of automatically
detecting the correct pre-processing transformation in a statistical learning
framework by implementing a deep-learning architecture. The purely data-driven
method allowed us to generalise the existing approaches of linear subspace
manipulation to non-linear hyperbolic problems with unknown advection fields.
The proposed algorithm has been validated against simple test cases to
benchmark its performances and later successfully applied to a multiphase
simulation.</span>

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) is well known for requiring large amounts of data
in order for RL agents to learn to perform complex tasks. Recent progress in
model-based RL allows agents to be much more data-efficient, as it enables them
to learn behaviors of visual environments in imagination by leveraging an
internal World Model of the environment. Improved sample efficiency can also be
achieved by reusing knowledge from previously learned tasks, but transfer
learning is still a challenging topic in RL. Parameter-based transfer learning
is generally done using an all-or-nothing approach, where the network&#x27;s
parameters are either fully transferred or randomly initialized. In this work
we present a simple alternative approach: fractional transfer learning. The
idea is to transfer fractions of knowledge, opposed to discarding potentially
useful knowledge as is commonly done with random initialization. Using the
World Model-based Dreamer algorithm, we identify which type of components this
approach is applicable to, and perform experiments in a new multi-source
transfer learning setting. The results show that fractional transfer learning
often leads to substantially improved performance and faster learning compared
to learning from scratch and random initialization.</span>

optimization toolbox, has been witnessing emerging applications. With simple
and easy to implement update rule, the algorithm bears several compelling
intuitions for empirical successes, yet rigorous justifications are still
largely unexplored. We study the computational properties of BPPA through
classification tasks with separable data, and demonstrate provable algorithmic
regularization effects associated with BPPA. We show that BPPA attains
non-trivial margin, which closely depends on the condition number of the
distance generating function inducing the Bregman divergence. We further
demonstrate that the dependence on the condition number is tight for a class of
problems, thus showing the importance of divergence in affecting the quality of
the obtained solutions. In addition, we extend our findings to mirror descent
(MD), for which we establish similar connections between the margin and Bregman
divergence. We demonstrate through a concrete example, and show BPPA/MD
converges in direction to the maximal margin solution with respect to the
Mahalanobis distance. Our theoretical findings are among the first to
demonstrate the benign learning properties BPPA/MD, and also provide
corroborations for a careful choice of divergence in the algorithmic design.</span>

                                        <span>The time required for training the neural networks increases with size,
complexity, and depth. Training model parameters by backpropagation inherently
creates feedback loops. These loops hinder efficient pipelining and scheduling
of the tasks within the layer and between consecutive layers. Prior approaches,
such as PipeDream, have exploited the use of delayed gradient to achieve
inter-layer pipelining. However, these approaches treat the entire
backpropagation as a single task; this leads to an increase in computation time
and processor underutilization. This paper presents novel optimization
approaches where the gradient computations with respect to the weights and the
activation functions are considered independently; therefore, these can be
computed in parallel. This is referred to as intra-layer optimization.
Additionally, the gradient computation with respect to the activation function
is further divided into two parts and distributed to two consecutive layers.
This leads to balanced scheduling where the computation time of each layer is
the same. This is referred to as inter-layer optimization. The proposed system,
referred to as LayerPipe, reduces the number of clock cycles required for
training while maximizing processor utilization with minimal inter-processor
communication overhead. LayerPipe achieves an average speedup of 25% and
upwards of 80% with 7 to 9 processors with less communication overhead when
compared to PipeDream.</span>

                                        <span>In machine learning (ML) applications, unfair predictions may discriminate
against a minority group. Most existing approaches for fair machine learning
(FML) treat fairness as a constraint or a penalization term in the optimization
of a ML model, which does not lead to the discovery of the complete landscape
of the trade-offs among learning accuracy and fairness metrics, and does not
integrate fairness in a meaningful way.

Recently, we have introduced a new paradigm for FML based on Stochastic
Multi-Objective Optimization (SMOO), where accuracy and fairness metrics stand
as conflicting objectives to be optimized simultaneously. The entire trade-offs
range is defined as the Pareto front of the SMOO problem, which can then be
efficiently computed using stochastic-gradient type algorithms. SMOO also
allows defining and computing new meaningful predictors for FML, a novel one
being the Sharpe predictor that we introduce and explore in this paper, and
which gives the highest ratio of accuracy-to-unfairness. Inspired from SMOO in
finance, the Sharpe predictor for FML provides the highest prediction return
(accuracy) per unit of prediction risk (unfairness).</span>

such as climate, transportation, and mining. Spatio-Temporal interpolation is
highly challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal relationships.
However, traditional techniques such as Kriging suffer from high running time
and poor performance on data that exhibit high variance across space and time
dimensions. To this end, we propose a novel deep neural network called as Deep
Geospatial Interpolation Network(DGIN), which incorporates both spatial and
temporal relationships and has significantly lower training time. DGIN consists
of three major components: Spatial Encoder to capture the spatial dependencies,
Sequential module to incorporate the temporal dynamics, and an Attention block
to learn the importance of the temporal neighborhood around the gap. We
evaluate DGIN on the MODIS reflectance dataset from two different regions. Our
experimental results indicate that DGIN has two advantages: (a) it outperforms
alternative approaches (has lower MSE with p-value &lt; 0.01) and, (b) it has
significantly low execution time than Kriging.</span>

of spinal related diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, degenerative cervical myelopathy and cancer. Automatic labeling of
the vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity
between discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and
surrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans
(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In
previous studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection
step and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false
positive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by
reformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation
technique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level
attention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their
skeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the
strength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the
missing area and false positive detection. To further improve the performance
of the proposed method, we propose a skeleton-based search space to reduce
false positive detection. The proposed method evaluated on spine generic public
multi-center dataset and demonstrated better performance comparing to previous
work, on both T1w and T2w contrasts. The method is implemented in ivadomed

non-overlapping camera views. Since person ReID data contains sensitive
personal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging
distributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However,
existing studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to
obtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to
learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID
enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server
aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data
privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and
distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of
cloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign
computation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict
suitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server
aggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID
datasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also
reduces computation cost by 29%. Our FedUReID system with the joint
optimization will shed light on implementing federated learning to more

with the data limitation and heterogeneity challenges in today&#x27;s edge learning
arena. However, its performance is often limited by slow convergence and
corresponding low communication efficiency. Besides, since the wireless
bandwidth and IoT devices&#x27; energy capacity are usually insufficient, it is
crucial to control the resource allocation and energy consumption when
deploying FML in realistic wireless networks. To overcome these challenges, in
this paper, we first rigorously analyze each device&#x27;s contribution to the
global loss reduction in each round and develop an FML algorithm (called NUFM)
with a non-uniform device selection scheme to accelerate the convergence. After
that, we formulate a resource allocation problem integrating NUFM in
multi-access wireless systems to jointly improve the convergence rate and
minimize the wall-clock time along with energy cost. By deconstructing the
original problem step by step, we devise a joint device selection and resource
allocation strategy (called URAL) to solve the problem and provide theoretical
guarantees. Further, we show that the computational complexity of NUFM can be
reduced from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$ (with $d$ being the model dimension) via
combining two first-order approximation techniques. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods
by comparing with the existing baselines.</span>

through the lens of Bayesian hierarchical models, upon which a Thompson

Gaussian bandits and Bernoulli bandits are carefully analyzed. The Bayes regret
for Gaussian bandits clearly demonstrates the benefits of information sharing

                                        <span>The generalization error of a classifier is related to the complexity of the
set of functions among which the classifier is chosen. Roughly speaking, the
more complex the family, the greater the potential disparity between the
training error and the population error of the classifier. This principle is
embodied in layman&#x27;s terms by Occam&#x27;s razor principle, which suggests favoring
low-complexity hypotheses over complex ones. We study a family of
low-complexity classifiers consisting of thresholding the one-dimensional
feature obtained by projecting the data on a random line after embedding it
into a higher dimensional space parametrized by monomials of order up to k.
More specifically, the extended data is projected n-times and the best
classifier among those n (based on its performance on training data) is chosen.
We obtain a bound on the generalization error of these low-complexity
classifiers. The bound is less than that of any classifier with a non-trivial
VC dimension, and thus less than that of a linear classifier. We also show
that, given full knowledge of the class conditional densities, the error of the
classifiers would converge to the optimal (Bayes) error as k and n go to
infinity; if only a training dataset is given, we show that the classifiers
will perfectly classify all the training points as k and n go to infinity.</span>

                                        <span>This paper investigates adaptive streaming of one or multiple tiled 360
videos from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to one or multiple single-antenna
users, respectively, in a multi-carrier wireless system. We aim to maximize the
video quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate adaptation
at each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each
(transmission) slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction,
we consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e.,
perfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions, and use
the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility
as the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize
the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission
beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each
case. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive
decoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the
FoVs, rates of the common and private messages, and transmission beamforming
vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. Then,
we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable
problems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally
optimal solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a
KKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally,
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains
over existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work revealing the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of
adaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.</span>

video-processing applications. In this paper, we show how video preprocessing
can artificially increase the popular quality metric VMAF and its
tuning-resistant version, VMAF NEG. We propose a pipeline that tunes
processing-algorithm parameters to increase VMAF by up to 218.8%. A subjective
comparison revealed that for most preprocessing methods, a video&#x27;s visual
quality drops or stays unchanged. We also show that some preprocessing methods
can increase VMAF NEG scores by up to 23.6%.</span>

                                        <span>In industry, there exist plenty of scenarios where old gray photos need to be
automatically colored, such as video sites and archives. In this paper, we
present the HistoryNet focusing on historical person&#x27;s diverse high fidelity
clothing colorization based on fine grained semantic understanding and prior.
Colorization of historical persons is realistic and practical, however,
existing methods do not perform well in the regards. In this paper, a
HistoryNet including three parts, namely, classification, fine grained semantic
parsing and colorization, is proposed. Classification sub-module supplies
classifying of images according to the eras, nationalities and garment types;
Parsing sub-network supplies the semantic for person contours, clothing and
background in the image to achieve more accurate colorization of clothes and
persons and prevent color overflow. In the training process, we integrate
classification and semantic parsing features into the coloring generation
network to improve colorization. Through the design of classification and
parsing subnetwork, the accuracy of image colorization can be improved and the
boundary of each part of image can be more clearly. Moreover, we also propose a
novel Modern Historical Movies Dataset (MHMD) containing 1,353,166 images and
42 labels of eras, nationalities, and garment types for automatic colorization
from 147 historical movies or TV series made in modern time. Various
quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art colorization methods, especially on military
uniforms, which has correct colors according to the historical literatures.</span>
