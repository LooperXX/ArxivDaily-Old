                                        <span>The capacity of empathy is crucial to the success of open-domain dialog
systems. Due to its nature of multi-dimensionality, there are various factors
that relate to empathy expression, such as communication mechanism, dialog act
and emotion. However, existing methods for empathetic response generation
usually either consider only one empathy factor or ignore the hierarchical
relationships between different factors, leading to a weak ability of empathy
modeling. In this paper, we propose a multi-factor hierarchical framework,
CoMAE, for empathetic response generation, which models the above three key
factors of empathy expression in a hierarchical way. We show experimentally
that our CoMAE-based model can generate more empathetic responses than previous
methods. We also highlight the importance of hierarchical modeling of different
factors through both the empirical analysis on a real-life corpus and the
extensive experiments. Our codes and used data are available at
https://github.com/chujiezheng/CoMAE.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning has been proposed and rapidly emerging as a viable means
for completing various tasks. Many few-shot models have been widely used for
relation learning tasks. However, each of these models has a shortage of
capturing a certain aspect of semantic features, for example, CNN on long-range
dependencies part, Transformer on local features. It is difficult for a single
model to adapt to various relation learning, which results in the high variance
problem. Ensemble strategy could be competitive on improving the accuracy of
few-shot relation extraction and mitigating high variance risks. This paper
explores an ensemble approach to reduce the variance and introduces fine-tuning
and feature attention strategies to calibrate relation-level features. Results
on several few-shot relation learning tasks show that our model significantly
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.</span>

                                        <span>Modern multi-document summarization (MDS) methods are based on transformer
architectures. They generate state of the art summaries, but lack
explainability. We focus on graph-based transformer models for MDS as they
gained recent popularity. We aim to improve the explainability of the
graph-based MDS by analyzing their attention weights. In a graph-based MDS such
as GraphSum, vertices represent the textual units, while the edges form some
similarity graph over the units. We compare GraphSum&#x27;s performance utilizing
different textual units, i. e., sentences versus paragraphs, on two news
benchmark datasets, namely WikiSum and MultiNews. Our experiments show that
paragraph-level representations provide the best summarization performance.
Thus, we subsequently focus oAnalysisn analyzing the paragraph-level attention
weights of GraphSum&#x27;s multi-heads and decoding layers in order to improve the
explainability of a transformer-based MDS model. As a reference metric, we
calculate the ROUGE scores between the input paragraphs and each sentence in
the generated summary, which indicate source origin information via text
similarity. We observe a high correlation between the attention weights and
this reference metric, especially on the the later decoding layers of the
transformer architecture. Finally, we investigate if the generated summaries
follow a pattern of positional bias by extracting which paragraph provided the
most information for each generated summary. Our results show that there is a
high correlation between the position in the summary and the source origin.</span>

                                        <span>Many people consider news articles to be a reliable source of information on
current events. However, due to the range of factors influencing news agencies,
such coverage may not always be impartial. Media bias, or slanted news
coverage, can have a substantial impact on public perception of events, and,
accordingly, can potentially alter the beliefs and views of the public. The
main data gap in current research on media bias detection is a robust,
representative, and diverse dataset containing annotations of biased words and
sentences. In particular, existing datasets do not control for the individual
background of annotators, which may affect their assessment and, thus,
represents critical information for contextualizing their annotations. In this
poster, we present a matrix-based methodology to crowdsource such data using a
self-developed annotation platform. We also present MBIC (Media Bias Including
Characteristics) - the first sample of 1,700 statements representing various
media bias instances. The statements were reviewed by ten annotators each and
contain labels for media bias identification both on the word and sentence
level. MBIC is the first available dataset about media bias reporting detailed
information on annotator characteristics and their individual background. The
current dataset already significantly extends existing data in this domain
providing unique and more reliable insights into the perception of bias. In
future, we will further extend it both with respect to the number of articles
and annotators per article.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge retrieval and reasoning are two key stages in multi-hop question
answering (QA) at web scale. Existing approaches suffer from low confidence
when retrieving evidence facts to fill the knowledge gap and lack transparent
reasoning process. In this paper, we propose a new framework to exploit more
valid facts while obtaining explainability for multi-hop QA by dynamically
constructing a semantic graph and reasoning over it. We employ Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) as semantic graph representation. Our framework contains
three new ideas: (a) {\tt AMR-SG}, an AMR-based Semantic Graph, constructed by
candidate fact AMRs to uncover any hop relations among question, answer and
multiple facts. (b) A novel path-based fact analytics approach exploiting {\tt
AMR-SG} to extract active facts from a large fact pool to answer questions. (c)
A fact-level relation modeling leveraging graph convolution network (GCN) to
guide the reasoning process. Results on two scientific multi-hop QA datasets
show that we can surpass recent approaches including those using additional
knowledge graphs while maintaining high explainability on OpenBookQA and
achieve a new state-of-the-art result on ARC-Challenge in a computationally
practicable setting.</span>

priorities while triggering contingency strategies, we propose a new
methodological approach that combines text mining, social network and big data
analytics, with the assessment of stakeholders&#x27; attitudes towards company core
values. This approach was applied in a case study where we considered the
Twitter discourse about core values in Italy. We collected more than 94,000
tweets related to the core values of the firms listed in Fortune&#x27;s ranking of
the World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies (2013-2017). For the Italian scenario, we
found three predominant core values orientations (Customers, Employees and
Excellence) - which should be at the basis of any business strategy - and three
latent ones (Economic-Financial Growth, Citizenship and Social Responsibility),
which need periodic attention. Our contribution is mostly methodological and
extends the research on text mining and on online big data analytics applied in
complex business contexts.</span>

they tend to attach it to a meaning that does not have a word yet in their
lexicon. In previous research, the strategy was shown to be optimal from an
information theoretic standpoint. However, the information theoretic model
employed neither explains the weakening of that vocabulary learning bias in
older children or polylinguals nor reproduces Zipf&#x27;s meaning-frequency law,
namely the non-linear relationship between the number of meanings of a word and
its frequency. Here we consider a generalization of the model that is channeled
to reproduce that law. The analysis of the new model reveals regions of the
phase space where the bias disappears consistently with the weakening or loss
of the bias in older children or polylinguals. In the deep learning era, the
model is a transparent low-dimensional tool for future experimental research
and illustrates the predictive power of a theoretical framework originally
designed to shed light on the origins of Zipf&#x27;s rank-frequency law.</span>

                                        <span>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that an over-parametrized network
consists of &quot;lottery tickets&quot;, and training a certain collection of them (i.e.,
a subnetwork) can match the performance of the full model. In this paper, we
study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as &quot;winning tickets&quot;,
in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language models. We
observe that at certain compression ratios, generalization performance of the
winning tickets can not only match, but also exceed that of the full model. In
particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the compression ratio
increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets first improves
then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the tickets on the
threshold as &quot;super tickets&quot;. We further show that the phase transition is task
and model dependent -- as model size becomes larger and training data set
becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced. Our experiments on the
GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve single task fine-tuning by
$0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on BERT-large, in terms of
task-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively sharing the super
tickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.</span>

the ability to understand and concern the feelings and experience of others.
Hence, it is critical to learn the causes that evoke the users&#x27; emotion for

                                        <span>Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important research area in cognitive
computation-thus in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are
necessary. At present, rich resource data-based SA has been well developed,
while the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e. a
target domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom
studied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of
supervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts),
and the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the
distinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private
knowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain
adaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based
shared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain common
features and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In
the second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared private
architecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first
mechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers
knowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a
target-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred
through a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations
verify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised
state-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is
that transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade
the target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose the proper source
domains to transfer from.</span>

computational costs by using a multi-stage ranking pipeline. In the first
stage, a number of potentially relevant candidates are retrieved using an
efficient retrieval model such as BM25. Although BM25 has proven decent
performance as a first-stage ranker, it tends to miss relevant passages. In
this context we propose CoRT, a simple neural first-stage ranking model that
leverages contextual representations from pretrained language models such as
BERT to complement term-based ranking functions while causing no significant
delay at query time. Using the MS MARCO dataset, we show that CoRT
significantly increases the candidate recall by complementing BM25 with missing
candidates. Consequently, we find subsequent re-rankers achieve superior
results with less candidates. We further demonstrate that passage retrieval
using CoRT can be realized with surprisingly low latencies.</span>

redundancy. Clinicians often populate new documents by duplicating existing
notes, then updating accordingly. Data duplication can lead to a propagation of
errors, inconsistencies and misreporting of care. Therefore, quantifying
information redundancy can play an essential role in evaluating innovations
that operate on clinical narratives.

This work is a quantitative examination of information redundancy in EHR
notes. We present and evaluate two strategies to measure redundancy: an
information-theoretic approach and a lexicosyntactic and semantic model. We
evaluate the measures by training large Transformer-based language models using
clinical text from a large openly available US-based ICU dataset and a large
multi-site UK based Trust. By comparing the information-theoretic content of
the trained models with open-domain language models, the language models
trained using clinical text have shown ~1.5x to ~3x less efficient than
open-domain corpora. Manual evaluation shows a high correlation with
lexicosyntactic and semantic redundancy, with averages ~43 to ~65%.</span>

expensive in inference, making them impractical in various resource-limited
real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic token
reduction approach to accelerate PLMs&#x27; inference, named TR-BERT, which could
flexibly adapt the layer number of each token in inference to avoid redundant
calculation. Specially, TR-BERT formulates the token reduction process as a
multi-step token selection problem and automatically learns the selection
strategy via reinforcement learning. The experimental results on several
downstream NLP tasks show that TR-BERT is able to speed up BERT by 2-5 times to
satisfy various performance demands. Moreover, TR-BERT can also achieve better
performance with less computation in a suite of long-text tasks since its
token-level layer number adaption greatly accelerates the self-attention
operation in PLMs. The source code and experiment details of this paper can be

                                        <span>A data-centric approach with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict
personality types based on the MBTI (an introspective self-assessment
questionnaire that indicates different psychological preferences about how
people perceive the world and make decisions) through systematic enrichment of
text representation, based on the domain of the area, under the generation of
features based on three types of analysis: sentimental, grammatical and
aspects. The experimentation had a robust baseline of stacked models, with
premature optimization of hyperparameters through grid search, with gradual
feedback, for each of the four classifiers (dichotomies) of MBTI. The results
showed that attention to the data iteration loop focused on quality,
explanatory power and representativeness for the abstraction of more
relevant/important resources for the studied phenomenon made it possible to
improve the evaluation metrics results more quickly and less costly than
complex models such as the LSTM or state of the art ones as BERT, as well as
the importance of these results by comparisons made from various perspectives.
In addition, the study demonstrated a broad spectrum for the evolution and
deepening of the task and possible approaches for a greater extension of the
abstraction of personality types.</span>

                                        <span>Recent grid-based document representations like BERTgrid allow the
simultaneous encoding of the textual and layout information of a document in a
2D feature map so that state-of-the-art image segmentation and/or object
detection models can be straightforwardly leveraged to extract key information
from documents. However, such methods have not achieved comparable performance
to state-of-the-art sequence- and graph-based methods such as LayoutLM and PICK
yet. In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal backbone network by
concatenating a BERTgrid to an intermediate layer of a CNN model, where the
input of CNN is a document image and the BERTgrid is a grid of word embeddings,
to generate a more powerful grid-based document representation, named
ViBERTgrid. Unlike BERTgrid, the parameters of BERT and CNN in our multimodal
backbone network are trained jointly. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this joint training strategy improves significantly the representation ability
of ViBERTgrid. Consequently, our ViBERTgrid-based key information extraction
approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.</span>

the theme of the document, in mind. This is in contrast with most seq2seq
decoders which simultaneously learn to focus on salient content, while deciding
what to generate, at each decoding step. With the motivation to narrow this
gap, we introduce Focus Attention Mechanism, a simple yet effective method to
encourage decoders to proactively generate tokens that are similar or topical
to the input document. Further, we propose a Focus Sampling method to enable
generation of diverse summaries, an area currently understudied in
summarization. When evaluated on the BBC extreme summarization task, two
state-of-the-art models augmented with Focus Attention generate summaries that
are closer to the target and more faithful to their input documents,
outperforming their vanilla counterparts on \rouge and multiple faithfulness
measures. We also empirically demonstrate that Focus Sampling is more effective
in generating diverse and faithful summaries than top-$k$ or nucleus
sampling-based decoding methods.</span>

argumentation research as of recent. A particularly challenging task is the
generation of counter-arguments. So far, approaches primarily focus on
rebutting a given conclusion, yet other ways to counter an argument exist. In
this work, we go beyond previous research by exploring argument undermining,
that is, countering an argument by attacking one of its premises. We
hypothesize that identifying the argument&#x27;s weak premises is key to effective
countering. Accordingly, we propose a pipeline approach that first assesses the
premises&#x27; strength and then generates a counter-argument targeting the weak
ones. On the one hand, both manual and automatic evaluation proves the
importance of identifying weak premises in counter-argument generation. On the
other hand, when considering correctness and content richness, human annotators
favored our approach over state-of-the-art counter-argument generation.</span>

underlying vision-and-language navigation (VLN), but in addition, they need to
be trained to handle the dynamic nature of dialogue. However, research in
Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (CVDN), where a navigator interacts
with a guide in natural language in order to reach a goal, treats the dialogue
history as a VLN-style static instruction. In this paper, we present VISITRON,
a navigator better suited to the interactive regime inherent to CVDN by being
trained to: i) identify and associate object-level concepts and semantics
between the environment and dialogue history, ii) identify when to interact vs.
navigate via imitation learning of a binary classification head. We perform
extensive ablations with VISITRON to gain empirical insights and improve
performance on CVDN. VISITRON is competitive with models on the static CVDN
leaderboard. We also propose a generalized interactive regime to fine-tune and
evaluate VISITRON and future such models with pre-trained guides for
adaptability.</span>

from pretrained masked language model-based encoders share a common, perhaps
undesirable pattern across layers. Namely, we find cases of persistent outlier
neurons within BERT and RoBERTa&#x27;s hidden state vectors that consistently bear
the smallest or largest values in said vectors. In an attempt to investigate
the source of this information, we introduce a neuron-level analysis method,
which reveals that the outliers are closely related to information captured by
positional embeddings. We also pre-train the RoBERTa-base models from scratch
and find that the outliers disappear without using positional embeddings. These
outliers, we find, are the major cause of anisotropy of encoders&#x27; raw vector
spaces, and clipping them leads to increased similarity across vectors. We
demonstrate this in practice by showing that clipped vectors can more
accurately distinguish word senses, as well as lead to better sentence
embeddings when mean pooling. In three supervised tasks, we find that clipping
does not affect the performance.</span>

                                        <span>Speakers communicate to influence their partner&#x27;s beliefs and shape their
actions. Belief- and action-based objectives have been explored independently
in recent computational models, but it has been challenging to explicitly
compare or integrate them. Indeed, we find that they are conflated in standard
referential communication tasks. To distinguish these accounts, we introduce a
new paradigm called signaling bandits, generalizing classic Lewis signaling
games to a multi-armed bandit setting where all targets in the context have
some relative value. We develop three speaker models: a belief-oriented speaker
with a purely informative objective; an action-oriented speaker with an
instrumental objective; and a combined speaker which integrates the two by
inducing listener beliefs that generally lead to desirable actions. We then
present a series of simulations demonstrating that grounding production choices
in future listener actions results in relevance effects and flexible uses of
nonliteral language. More broadly, our findings suggest that language games
based on richer decision problems are a promising avenue for insight into
rational communication.</span>

                                        <span>Cross-lingual speech adaptation aims to solve the problem of leveraging
multiple rich-resource languages to build models for a low-resource target
language. Since the low-resource language has limited training data, speech
recognition models can easily overfit. In this paper, we propose to use
adapters to investigate the performance of multiple adapters for
parameter-efficient cross-lingual speech adaptation. Based on our previous
MetaAdapter that implicitly leverages adapters, we propose a novel algorithms
called SimAdapter for explicitly learning knowledge from adapters. Our
algorithm leverages adapters which can be easily integrated into the
Transformer structure.MetaAdapter leverages meta-learning to transfer the
general knowledge from training data to the test language. SimAdapter aims to
learn the similarities between the source and target languages during
fine-tuning using the adapters. We conduct extensive experiments on
five-low-resource languages in Common Voice dataset. Results demonstrate that
our MetaAdapter and SimAdapter methods can reduce WER by 2.98% and 2.55% with
only 2.5% and 15.5% of trainable parameters compared to the strong full-model
fine-tuning baseline. Moreover, we also show that these two novel algorithms
can be integrated for better performance with up to 3.55% relative WER
reduction.</span>

(DCQG), which aims at generating questions with required difficulty levels.
Previous research on this task mainly defines the difficulty of a question as
whether it can be correctly answered by a Question Answering (QA) system,
lacking interpretability and controllability. In our work, we redefine question
difficulty as the number of inference steps required to answer it and argue
that Question Generation (QG) systems should have stronger control over the
logic of generated questions. To this end, we propose a novel framework that
progressively increases question difficulty through step-by-step rewriting
under the guidance of an extracted reasoning chain. A dataset is automatically
constructed to facilitate the research, on which extensive experiments are
conducted to test the performance of our method.</span>

legal scholars and practitioners a range of tools allowing to empirically
analyze law on a large scale. However, researchers seem to struggle when it
comes to identifying ethical limits to using NLP systems for acquiring genuine
insights both about the law and the systems&#x27; predictive capacity. In this paper
we set out a number of ways in which to think systematically about such issues.
We place emphasis on three crucial normative parameters which have, to the best
of our knowledge, been underestimated by current debates: (a) the importance of
academic freedom, (b) the existence of a wide diversity of legal and ethical
norms domestically but even more so internationally and (c) the threat of
moralism in research related to computational law. For each of these three
parameters we provide specific recommendations for the legal NLP community. Our
discussion is structured around the study of a real-life scenario that has
prompted recent debate in the legal NLP research community.</span>

                                        <span>A key challenge of dialog systems research is to effectively and efficiently
adapt to new domains. A scalable paradigm for adaptation necessitates the
development of generalizable models that perform well in few-shot settings. In
this paper, we focus on the intent classification problem which aims to
identify user intents given utterances addressed to the dialog system. We
propose two approaches for improving the generalizability of utterance
classification models: (1) observers and (2) example-driven training. Prior
work has shown that BERT-like models tend to attribute a significant amount of
attention to the [CLS] token, which we hypothesize results in diluted
representations. Observers are tokens that are not attended to, and are an
alternative to the [CLS] token as a semantic representation of utterances.
Example-driven training learns to classify utterances by comparing to examples,
thereby using the underlying encoder as a sentence similarity model. These
methods are complementary; improving the representation through observers
allows the example-driven model to better measure sentence similarities. When
combined, the proposed methods attain state-of-the-art results on three intent
prediction datasets (\textsc{banking77}, \textsc{clinc150}, \textsc{hwu64}) in
both the full data and few-shot (10 examples per intent) settings. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the proposed approach can transfer to new intents and
across datasets without any additional training.</span>

Character Recognition (OCR) process. In this paper, we improve the noise-aware
training method by proposing an empirical error generation approach that
employs a sequence-to-sequence model trained to perform translation from
error-free to erroneous text. Using an OCR engine, we generated a large
parallel text corpus for training and produced several real-world noisy
sequence labeling benchmarks for evaluation. Moreover, to overcome the data
sparsity problem that exacerbates in the case of imperfect textual input, we
learned noisy language model-based embeddings. Our approach outperformed the
baseline noise generation and error correction techniques on the erroneous
sequence labeling data sets. To facilitate future research on robustness, we
make our code, embeddings, and data conversion scripts publicly available.</span>

challenging for the Seq2Seq architecture, as Seq2Seq is not good at analyzing
long-distance relations in text. In this paper, we present BASS, a novel
framework for Boosting Abstractive Summarization based on a unified Semantic
graph, which aggregates co-referent phrases distributing across a long range of
context and conveys rich relations between phrases. Further, a graph-based
encoder-decoder model is proposed to improve both the document representation
and summary generation process by leveraging the graph structure. Specifically,
several graph augmentation methods are designed to encode both the explicit and
implicit relations in the text while the graph-propagation attention mechanism
is developed in the decoder to select salient content into the summary.
Empirical results show that the proposed architecture brings substantial
improvements for both long-document and multi-document summarization tasks.</span>

natural language processing tasks. Though BERT-based pre-trained language
models achieve high performance on many downstream tasks, the native derived
sentence representations are proved to be collapsed and thus produce a poor
performance on the semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. In this paper, we
present ConSERT, a Contrastive Framework for Self-Supervised Sentence
Representation Transfer, that adopts contrastive learning to fine-tune BERT in
an unsupervised and effective way. By making use of unlabeled texts, ConSERT
solves the collapse issue of BERT-derived sentence representations and make
them more applicable for downstream tasks. Experiments on STS datasets
demonstrate that ConSERT achieves an 8\% relative improvement over the previous
state-of-the-art, even comparable to the supervised SBERT-NLI. And when further
incorporating NLI supervision, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on
STS tasks. Moreover, ConSERT obtains comparable results with only 1000 samples
available, showing its robustness in data scarcity scenarios.</span>

resolve the task of machine reading comprehension. Most existing approaches
propose to concat question and option together to form a context-aware model.
However, we argue that straightforward concatenation can only provide a
coarse-grained context for the MRC task, ignoring the specific positions of the
option relative to the question. In this paper, we propose a novel MRC model by
filling options into the question to produce a fine-grained context (defined as
summary) which can better reveal the relationship between option and question.
We conduct a series of experiments on the given dataset, and the results show

imperceptible perturbation. Adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted
with a malicious purpose, can lead to erroneous predictions, resulting in
catastrophic accidents. To mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks, we
propose a novel purification model called CAP-GAN. CAP-GAN takes account of the
idea of pixel-level and feature-level consistency to achieve reasonable
purification under cycle-consistent learning. Specifically, we utilize the
guided attention module and knowledge distillation to convey meaningful
information to the purification model. Once a model is fully trained, inputs
would be projected into the purification model and transformed into clean-like
images. We vary the capacity of the adversary to argue the robustness against
various types of attack strategies. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, CAP-GAN
outperforms other pre-processing based defenses under both black-box and
white-box settings.</span>

                                        <span>Automatically detecting the positions of key-points (e.g., facial key-points
or finger key-points) in an image is an essential problem in many applications,
such as driver&#x27;s gaze detection and drowsiness detection in automated driving
systems. With the recent advances of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Key-Points
detection DNNs (KP-DNNs) have been increasingly employed for that purpose.
Nevertheless, KP-DNN testing and validation have remained a challenging problem
because KP-DNNs predict many independent key-points at the same time -- where
each individual key-point may be critical in the targeted application -- and
images can vary a great deal according to many factors.

In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate test data for
KP-DNNs using many-objective search. In our experiments, focused on facial
key-points detection DNNs developed for an industrial automotive application,
we show that our approach can generate test suites to severely mispredict, on
average, more than 93% of all key-points. In comparison, random search-based
test data generation can only severely mispredict 41% of them. Many of these
mispredictions, however, are not avoidable and should not therefore be
considered failures. We also empirically compare state-of-the-art,
many-objective search algorithms and their variants, tailored for test suite
generation. Furthermore, we investigate and demonstrate how to learn specific
conditions, based on image characteristics (e.g., head posture and skin color),
that lead to severe mispredictions. Such conditions serve as a basis for risk
analysis or DNN retraining.</span>

pressure distribution from raw PA signals. The standard reconstruction of
medical image could cause the artifacts due to interferences or ill-posed
setup. Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA image with
ill-posed conditions. Most works remove the artifacts from image domain, and
compensate the limited-view from dataset. In this paper, we propose a jointed
feature fusion framework (JEFF-Net) based on deep learning to reconstruct the
PA image using limited-view data. The cross-domain features from limited-view
position-wise data and the reconstructed image are fused by a backtracked
supervision. Specifically, our results could generate superior performance,
whose artifacts are drastically reduced in the output compared to ground-truth
(full-view reconstructed result). In this paper, a quarter position-wise data
(32 channels) is fed into model, which outputs another 3-quarters-view data (96
channels). Moreover, two novel losses are designed to restrain the artifacts by
sufficiently manipulating superposed data. The numerical and in-vivo results
have demonstrated the superior performance of our method to reconstruct the
full-view image without artifacts. Finally, quantitative evaluations show that
our proposed method outperformed the ground-truth in some metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Rotation detection serves as a fundamental building block in many visual
applications involving aerial image, scene text, and face etc. Differing from
the dominant regression-based approaches for orientation estimation, this paper
explores a relatively less-studied methodology based on classification. The
hope is to inherently dismiss the boundary discontinuity issue as encountered
by the regression-based detectors. We propose new techniques to push its
frontier in two aspects: i) new encoding mechanism: the design of two Densely
Coded Labels (DCL) for angle classification, to replace the Sparsely Coded
Label (SCL) in existing classification-based detectors, leading to three times
training speed increase as empirically observed across benchmarks, further with
notable improvement in detection accuracy; ii) loss re-weighting: we propose
Angle Distance and Aspect Ratio Sensitive Weighting (ADARSW), which improves
the detection accuracy especially for square-like objects, by making DCL-based
detectors sensitive to angular distance and object&#x27;s aspect ratio. Extensive
experiments and visual analysis on large-scale public datasets for aerial
images i.e. DOTA, UCAS-AOD, HRSC2016, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015
and MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach. The source code is available

(3DFA) algorithms. Traditionally, performance analysis relies on carefully
annotated datasets. Here, these annotations correspond to the 3D coordinates of
a set of pre-defined facial landmarks. However, this annotation process, be it
manual or automatic, is rarely error-free, which strongly biases the analysis.
In contrast, we propose a fully unsupervised methodology based on robust
statistics and a parametric confidence test. We revisit the problem of robust
estimation of the rigid transformation between two point sets and we describe
two algorithms, one based on a mixture between a Gaussian and a uniform
distribution, and another one based on the generalized Student&#x27;s
t-distribution. We show that these methods are robust to up to 50% outliers,
which makes them suitable for mapping a face, from an unknown pose to a frontal
pose, in the presence of facial expressions and occlusions. Using these methods
in conjunction with large datasets of face images, we build a statistical
frontal facial model and an associated parametric confidence metric, eventually
used for performance analysis. We empirically show that the proposed pipeline
is neither method-biased nor data-biased, and that it can be used to assess
both the performance of 3DFA algorithms and the accuracy of annotations of face

                                        <span>Contrastive learning has recently seen tremendous success in self-supervised
learning. So far, however, it is largely unclear why the learned
representations generalize so effectively to a large variety of downstream
tasks. We here prove that feedforward models trained with objectives belonging
to the commonly used InfoNCE family learn to implicitly invert the underlying
generative model of the observed data. While the proofs make certain
statistical assumptions about the generative model, we observe empirically that
our findings hold even if these assumptions are severely violated. Our theory
highlights a fundamental connection between contrastive learning, generative
modeling, and nonlinear independent component analysis, thereby furthering our
understanding of the learned representations as well as providing a theoretical
foundation to derive more effective contrastive losses.</span>

                                        <span>To calculate the model accuracy on a computer vision task, e.g., object
recognition, we usually require a test set composing of test samples and their
ground truth labels. Whilst standard usage cases satisfy this requirement, many
real-world scenarios involve unlabeled test data, rendering common model
evaluation methods infeasible. We investigate this important and under-explored
problem, Automatic model Evaluation (AutoEval). Specifically, given a labeled
training set and a classifier, we aim to estimate the classification accuracy
on unlabeled test datasets. We construct a meta-dataset: a dataset comprised of
datasets generated from the original images via various transformations such as
rotation, background substitution, foreground scaling, etc. As the
classification accuracy of the model on each sample (dataset) is known from the
original dataset labels, our task can be solved via regression. Using the
feature statistics to represent the distribution of a sample dataset, we can
train regression models (e.g., a regression neural network) to predict model
performance. Using synthetic meta-dataset and real-world datasets in training
and testing, respectively, we report a reasonable and promising prediction of
the model accuracy. We also provide insights into the application scope,
limitation, and potential future direction of AutoEval.</span>

requirements (e.g., hyperparameter validation, collection of outlier data) and
produce side effects (e.g., classification accuracy drop, slower
energy-inefficient inferences). We argue that these issues are a consequence of
the SoftMax loss anisotropy and disagreement with the maximum entropy
principle. Thus, we propose the IsoMax loss and the entropic score. The
seamless drop-in replacement of the SoftMax loss by IsoMax loss requires
neither additional data collection nor hyperparameter validation. The trained
models do not exhibit classification accuracy drop and produce fast
energy-efficient inferences. Moreover, our experiments show that training
neural networks with IsoMax loss significantly improves their OOD detection
performance. The IsoMax loss exhibits state-of-the-art performance under the
mentioned conditions (fast energy-efficient inference, no classification
accuracy drop, no collection of outlier data, and no hyperparameter
validation), which we call the seamless OOD detection task. In future work,
current OOD detection methods may replace the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss
to improve their performance on the commonly studied non-seamless OOD detection
problem.</span>

boundaries of research and development in intelligent video analysis for
smarter cities use cases, and (2) assessing tasks where the level of
performance is enough to cause real-world adoption. Transportation is a segment
ripe for such adoption. The fifth AI City Challenge attracted 305 participating
teams across 38 countries, who leveraged city-scale real traffic data and
high-quality synthetic data to compete in five challenge tracks. Track 1
addressed video-based automatic vehicle counting, where the evaluation being
conducted on both algorithmic effectiveness and computational efficiency. Track
2 addressed city-scale vehicle re-identification with augmented synthetic data
to substantially increase the training set for the task. Track 3 addressed
city-scale multi-target multi-camera vehicle tracking. Track 4 addressed
traffic anomaly detection. Track 5 was a new track addressing vehicle retrieval
using natural language descriptions. The evaluation system shows a general
leader board of all submitted results, and a public leader board of results
limited to the contest participation rules, where teams are not allowed to use
external data in their work. The public leader board shows results more close
to real-world situations where annotated data is limited. Results show the
promise of AI in Smarter Transportation. State-of-the-art performance for some
tasks shows that these technologies are ready for adoption in real-world
systems.</span>

tasks, one issue remains: The current strategies rely heavily on a huge amount
of labeled data. In many real-world problems, it is not feasible to create such
an amount of labeled training data. Therefore, it is common to incorporate
unlabeled data into the training process to reach equal results with fewer
labels. Due to a lot of concurrent research, it is difficult to keep track of
recent developments. In this survey, we provide an overview of often used ideas
and methods in image classification with fewer labels. We compare 34 methods in
detail based on their performance and their commonly used ideas rather than a
fine-grained taxonomy. In our analysis, we identify three major trends that
lead to future research opportunities. 1. State-of-the-art methods are
scaleable to real-world applications in theory but issues like class imbalance,
robustness, or fuzzy labels are not considered. 2. The degree of supervision
which is needed to achieve comparable results to the usage of all labels is
decreasing and therefore methods need to be extended to settings with a
variable number of classes. 3. All methods share some common ideas but we
identify clusters of methods that do not share many ideas. We show that
combining ideas from different clusters can lead to better performance.</span>

sensing images from land cover maps and auxiliary raster data using generative
adversarial networks (GANs). In remote sensing, many types of data, such as
digital elevation models (DEMs) or precipitation maps, are often not reflected
in land cover maps but still influence image content or structure. Including
such data in the synthesis process increases the quality of the generated
images and exerts more control on their characteristics. Spatially adaptive
normalization layers fuse both inputs and are applied to a full-blown generator
architecture consisting of encoder and decoder to take full advantage of the
information content in the auxiliary raster data. Our method successfully
synthesizes medium (10 m) and high (1 m) resolution images when trained with
the corresponding data set. We show the advantage of data fusion of land cover
maps and auxiliary information using mean intersection over unions (mIoUs),
pixel accuracy, and Fr\&#x27;echet inception distances (FIDs) using pretrained U-Net
segmentation models. Handpicked images exemplify how fusing information avoids
ambiguities in the synthesized images. By slightly editing the input, our
method can be used to synthesize realistic changes, i.e., raising the water
levels. The source code is available at https://github.com/gbaier/rs_img_synth

                                        <span>Most of the existing works on human activity analysis focus on recognition or
early recognition of the activity labels from complete or partial observations.
Similarly, almost all of the existing video captioning approaches focus on the
observed events in videos. Predicting the labels and the captions of future
activities where no frames of the predicted activities have been observed is a
challenging problem, with important applications that require anticipatory
response. In this work, we propose a system that can infer the labels and the
captions of a sequence of future activities. Our proposed network for label
prediction of a future activity sequence has three branches where the first
branch takes visual features from the objects present in the scene, the second
branch takes observed sequential activity features, and the third branch
captures the last observed activity features. The predicted labels and the
observed scene context are then mapped to meaningful captions using a
sequence-to-sequence learning-based method. Experiments on four challenging
activity analysis datasets and a video description dataset demonstrate that our
label prediction approach achieves comparable performance with the
state-of-the-arts and our captioning framework outperform the
state-of-the-arts.</span>

                                        <span>Depth maps captured with commodity sensors are often of low quality and
resolution; these maps need to be enhanced to be used in many applications.
State-of-the-art data-driven methods of depth map super-resolution rely on
registered pairs of low- and high-resolution depth maps of the same scenes.
Acquisition of real-world paired data requires specialized setups. Another
alternative, generating low-resolution maps from high-resolution maps by
subsampling, adding noise and other artificial degradation methods, does not
fully capture the characteristics of real-world low-resolution images. As a
consequence, supervised learning methods trained on such artificial paired data
may not perform well on real-world low-resolution inputs. We consider an
approach to depth map enhancement based on learning from unpaired data. While
many techniques for unpaired image-to-image translation have been proposed,
most are not directly applicable to depth maps. We propose an unpaired learning
method for simultaneous depth enhancement and super-resolution, which is based
on a learnable degradation model and surface normal estimates as features to
produce more accurate depth maps. We demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing unpaired methods and performs on par with paired methods on a new
benchmark for unpaired learning that we developed.</span>

                                        <span>Existing deep learning methods for diagnosis of gastric cancer commonly use
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Recently, the Visual Transformer (VT) has
attracted a major attention because of its performance and efficiency, but its
applications are mostly in the field of computer vision. In this paper, a
multi-scale visual transformer model, referred to as GasHis-Transformer, is
proposed for gastric histopathology image classification (GHIC), which enables
the automatic classification of microscopic gastric images into abnormal and
normal cases. The GasHis-Transformer model consists of two key modules: a
global information module (GIM) and a local information module (LIM) to extract
pathological features effectively. In our experiments, a public hematoxylin and
eosin (H&amp;E) stained gastric histopathology dataset with 280 abnormal or normal
images using the GasHis-Transformer model is applied to estimate precision,
recall, F1-score, and accuracy on the testing set as 98.0%, 100.0%, 96.0% and
98.0% respectively. Furthermore, a critical study is conducted to evaluate the
robustness of GasHis-Transformer according to add ten different noises
including adversarial attack and traditional image noise. In addition, a
clinically meaningful study is executed to test the gastric cancer
identification of GasHis-Transformerwith 420 abnormal images and achieves 96.2%
accuracy. Finally, a comparative study is performed to test the
generalizability with both H&amp;E and Immunohistochemical (IHC) stained images on
a lymphoma image dataset, a breast cancer dataset and a cervical cancer
dataset, producing comparable F1-scores (85.6%, 82.8% and 65.7%, respectively)
and accuracy (83.9%, 89.4% and 65.7%, respectively) respectively. In
conclusion, GasHis-Transformerdemonstrates a high classification performance
and shows its significant potential in histopathology image analysis.</span>

for recognizing an unseen class. One way to alleviate this problem is to
acquire a strong inductive bias via meta-learning on similar tasks. In this
paper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection
of unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among
seen and unseen classes. Specifically, we propose a novel part-based
self-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable
representations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative
part. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data
scarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra
images from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and
tieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results,
outperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under
5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with

interaction of vision and language of robots is particularly difficult. We
consider that giving robots an understanding of visual semantics and language
semantics will improve inference ability. In this paper, we propose a novel
method-VSGM (Visual Semantic Graph Memory), which uses the semantic graph to
obtain better visual image features, improve the robot&#x27;s visual understanding
ability. By providing prior knowledge of the robot and detecting the objects in
the image, it predicts the correlation between the attributes of the object and
the objects and converts them into a graph-based representation; and mapping
the object in the image to be a top-down egocentric map. Finally, the important
object features of the current task are extracted by Graph Neural Networks. The
method proposed in this paper is verified in the ALFRED (Action Learning From
Realistic Environments and Directives) dataset. In this dataset, the robot
needs to perform daily indoor household tasks following the required language
instructions. After the model is added to the VSGM, the task success rate can
be improved by 6~10%.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning networks have shown promising performance for accurate object
localization in medial images, but require large amount of annotated data for
supervised training, which is expensive and expertise burdensome. To address
this problem, we present a one-shot framework for organ and landmark
localization in volumetric medical images, which does not need any annotation
during the training stage and could be employed to locate any landmarks or
organs in test images given a support (reference) image during the inference
stage. Our main idea comes from that tissues and organs from different human
bodies have a similar relative position and context. Therefore, we could
predict the relative positions of their non-local patches, thus locate the
target organ. Our framework is composed of three parts: (1) A projection
network trained to predict the 3D offset between any two patches from the same
volume, where human annotations are not required. In the inference stage, it
takes one given landmark in a reference image as a support patch and predicts
the offset from a random patch to the corresponding landmark in the test
(query) volume. (2) A coarse-to-fine framework contains two projection
networks, providing more accurate localization of the target. (3) Based on the
coarse-to-fine model, we transfer the organ boundingbox (B-box) detection to
locating six extreme points along x, y and z directions in the query volume.
Experiments on multi-organ localization from head-and-neck (HaN) CT volumes
showed that our method acquired competitive performance in real time, which is
more accurate and 10^5 times faster than template matching methods with the
same setting. Code is available: https://github.com/LWHYC/RPR-Loc.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision (CV). However, training and inference of DNN models are both memory and
computation intensive, incurring significant overhead in terms of energy
consumption and silicon area. In particular, inference is much more
cost-sensitive than training because training can be done offline with powerful
platforms, while inference may have to be done on battery powered devices with
constrained form factors, especially for mobile or edge vision applications. In
order to accelerate DNN inference, model quantization was proposed. However
previous works only focus on the quantization rate without considering the
efficiency of operations. In this paper, we propose Dendrite-Tree based Neural
Network (DTNN) for energy-efficient inference with table lookup operations
enabled by activation quantization. In DTNN both costly weight access and
arithmetic computations are eliminated for inference. We conducted experiments
on various kinds of DNN models such as LeNet-5, MobileNet, VGG, and ResNet with
different datasets, including MNIST, Cifar10/Cifar100, SVHN, and ImageNet. DTNN
achieved significant energy saving (19.4X and 64.9X improvement on ResNet-18
and VGG-11 with ImageNet, respectively) with negligible loss of accuracy. To
further validate the effectiveness of DTNN and compare with state-of-the-art
low energy implementation for edge vision, we design and implement DTNN based
MLP image classifiers using off-the-shelf FPGAs. The results show that DTNN on
the FPGA, with higher accuracy, could achieve orders of magnitude better energy
consumption and latency compared with the state-of-the-art low energy
approaches reported that use ASIC chips.</span>

lungs affected by lesions is essential for formulating treatment

our models we are able to segment the lesions, evaluatepatients dynamics,
estimate relative volume of lungs affected by lesions and evaluate the lung
damage stage. Our modelswere trained on data from different medical centers. We
compared predictions of our models with those of six experiencedradiologists
and our segmentation model outperformed most of them. On the task of

human faces and ensure legitimate users can use authorization-protected data,
reversible adversarial attack technique is rise. Reversible adversarial
examples (RAE) get both attack capability and reversibility at the same time.
However, the existing technique can not meet application requirements because
of serious distortion and failure of image recovery when adversarial
perturbations get strong. In this paper, we take advantage of Reversible Image
Transformation technique to generate RAE and achieve reversible adversarial
attack. Experimental results show that proposed RAE generation scheme can
ensure imperceptible image distortion and the original image can be
reconstructed error-free. What&#x27;s more, both the attack ability and the image

                                        <span>In end-to-end optimized learned image compression, it is standard practice to
use a convolutional variational autoencoder with generalized divisive
normalization (GDN) to transform images into a latent space. Recently,
Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) that learn the best non-linearity from a set
of alternatives, and their self-organized variants, Self-ONNs, that approximate
any non-linearity via Taylor series have been proposed to address the
limitations of convolutional layers and a fixed nonlinear activation. In this
paper, we propose to replace the convolutional and GDN layers in the
variational autoencoder with self-organized operational layers, and propose a
novel self-organized variational autoencoder (Self-VAE) architecture that
benefits from stronger non-linearity. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Self-VAE yields improvements in both rate-distortion performance

fields such as security, anomaly detection, land use planning and land use
change detection. However, critical infrastructures detection in aerial and
satellite images is still a challenge as each one has completely different size
and requires different spacial resolution to be identified correctly.
Heretofore, there are no special datasets for training critical infrastructures
detectors. This paper presents a smart dataset as well as a
resolution-independent critical infrastructure detection system. In particular,
guided by the performance of the detection model, we built a dataset organized
into two scales, small and large scale, and designed a two-stage deep learning
detection of different scale critical infrastructures (DetDSCI) methodology in
ortho-images. DetDSCI methodology first determines the input image zoom level
using a classification model, then analyses the input image with the
appropriate scale detection model. Our experiments show that DetDSCI
methodology achieves up to 37,53% F1 improvement with respect to the baseline
detector.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning often involves metric learning-based classifiers, which
predict the image label by comparing the distance between the extracted feature
vector and class representations. However, applying global pooling in the
backend of the feature extractor may not produce an embedding that correctly
focuses on the class object. In this work, we propose a novel framework that
generates class representations by extracting features from class-relevant
regions of the images. Given only a few exemplary images with image-level
labels, our framework first localizes the class objects by spatially
decomposing the similarity between the images and their class prototypes. Then,
enhanced class representations are achieved from the localization results. We
also propose a loss function to enhance distinctions of the refined features.
Our method outperforms the baseline few-shot model in miniImageNet and
tieredImageNet benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>We address the problem of compressed sensing using a deep generative prior
model and consider both linear and learned nonlinear sensing mechanisms, where
the nonlinear one involves either a fully connected neural network or a
convolutional neural network. Recently, it has been argued that the
distribution of natural images do not lie in a single manifold but rather lie
in a union of several submanifolds. We propose a sparsity-driven latent space
sampling (SDLSS) framework and develop a proximal meta-learning (PML) algorithm
to enforce sparsity in the latent space. SDLSS allows the range-space of the
generator to be considered as a union-of-submanifolds. We also derive the
sample complexity bounds within the SDLSS framework for the linear measurement
model. The results demonstrate that for a higher degree of compression, the
SDLSS method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art method. We first
consider a comparison between linear and nonlinear sensing mechanisms on
Fashion-MNIST dataset and show that the learned nonlinear version is superior
to the linear one. Subsequent comparisons with the deep compressive sensing
(DCS) framework proposed in the literature are reported. We also consider the
effect of the dimension of the latent space and the sparsity factor in
validating the SDLSS framework. Performance quantification is carried out by
employing three objective metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
structural similarity index metric (SSIM), and reconstruction error (RE).</span>

convolutional neural networks, notably semantic segmentation. These works deal
with a specific vision task known as &quot;RGB-D Indoor Semantic Segmentation&quot;. The
challenges and resulting solutions of this task differ from its standard RGB

analysis. This task has been easier since deep learning models have taken over
with its high performing behavior. However, deep learning models dependency on
large data proves it to be an obstacle in medical image analysis because of
insufficient data samples. Several data augmentation techniques have been used
to mitigate this problem. We propose a new augmentation method by introducing
adversarial learning attack techniques, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method
(FGSM). Furthermore, We have also introduced the concept of Inverse FGSM
(InvFGSM), which works in the opposite manner of FGSM for the data
augmentation. This two approaches worked together to improve the segmentation
accuracy, as well as helped the model to gain robustness against adversarial
attacks. The overall analysis of experiments indicates a novel use of
adversarial machine learning along with robustness enhancement.</span>

                                        <span>The cost aggregation strategy shows a crucial role in learning-based stereo
matching tasks, where 3D convolutional filters obtain state of the art but
require intensive computation resources, while 2D operations need less GPU
memory but are sensitive to domain shift. In this paper, we decouple the 4D
cubic cost volume used by 3D convolutional filters into sequential cost maps
along the direction of disparity instead of dealing with it at once by
exploiting a recurrent cost aggregation strategy. Furthermore, a novel
recurrent module, Stacked Recurrent Hourglass (SRH), is proposed to process
each cost map. Our hourglass network is constructed based on Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs) and down/upsampling layers, which provides GRUs larger receptive
fields. Then two hourglass networks are stacked together, while multi-scale
information is processed by skip connections to enhance the performance of the
pipeline in textureless areas. The proposed architecture is implemented in an
end-to-end pipeline and evaluated on public datasets, which reduces GPU memory
consumption by up to 56.1\% compared with PSMNet using stacked hourglass 3D
CNNs without the degradation of accuracy. Then, we further demonstrate the
scalability of the proposed method on several high-resolution pairs, while
previously learned approaches often fail due to the memory constraint. The code

                                        <span>Automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic CT enables rapid quantitative
analysis of lung involvement in COVID- 19 infections. Obtaining voxel-level
annotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive.
Therefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense
regression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation
approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated
from high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs
provide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object
segmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network
to compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local
details. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe
lesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information
regarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification
approach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense
conditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The
refined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation
network. When evaluated on 69 CT scans, our method substantially improves the
intersection over union from 0.335 in the CAM-based weakly supervised
segmentation method to 0.495.</span>

unknown surface reflectance (e.g. non-Lambertian) is regarded as a challenging
task in multi-view reconstruction. The major obstacle revolves around
establishing cross-view correspondences where photometric constancy is
violated. This paper proposes a simple and practical solution to overcome this
challenge based on a co-located camera-light scanner device. Unlike existing
solutions, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence. Instead, we argue the
problem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric
constraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We formulate
the reconstruction task as a joint energy minimization over the surface
geometry and reflectance. Despite this energy is highly non-convex, we develop
an optimization algorithm that robustly recovers globally optimal shape and
reflectance even from a random initialization. Extensive experiments on both
simulated and real data have validated our method, and possible future
extensions are discussed.</span>

super-resolution (SR) but often require sophisticated architectures with heavy
memory cost and computational overhead, significantly restricts their practical
deployments on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we proposed a novel
contrastive self-distillation (CSD) framework to simultaneously compress and
accelerate various off-the-shelf SR models. In particular, a channel-splitting
super-resolution network can first be constructed from a target teacher network
as a compact student network. Then, we propose a novel contrastive loss to
improve the quality of SR images and PSNR/SSIM via explicit knowledge transfer.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSD scheme effectively
compresses and accelerates several standard SR models such as EDSR, RCAN and
CARN. Code is available at https://github.com/Booooooooooo/CSD.</span>

                                        <span>Recent grid-based document representations like BERTgrid allow the
simultaneous encoding of the textual and layout information of a document in a
2D feature map so that state-of-the-art image segmentation and/or object
detection models can be straightforwardly leveraged to extract key information
from documents. However, such methods have not achieved comparable performance
to state-of-the-art sequence- and graph-based methods such as LayoutLM and PICK
yet. In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal backbone network by
concatenating a BERTgrid to an intermediate layer of a CNN model, where the
input of CNN is a document image and the BERTgrid is a grid of word embeddings,
to generate a more powerful grid-based document representation, named
ViBERTgrid. Unlike BERTgrid, the parameters of BERT and CNN in our multimodal
backbone network are trained jointly. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this joint training strategy improves significantly the representation ability
of ViBERTgrid. Consequently, our ViBERTgrid-based key information extraction
approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.</span>

                                        <span>High resolution electroluminescence (EL) images captured in the infrared
spectrum allow to visually and non-destructively inspect the quality of
photovoltaic (PV) modules. Currently, however, such a visual inspection
requires trained experts to discern different kinds of defects, which is
time-consuming and expensive. Automated segmentation of cells is therefore a
key step in automating the visual inspection workflow. In this work, we propose
a robust automated segmentation method for extraction of individual solar cells
from EL images of PV modules. This enables controlled studies on large amounts
of data to understanding the effects of module degradation over time-a process
not yet fully understood. The proposed method infers in several steps a
high-level solar module representation from low-level edge features. An
important step in the algorithm is to formulate the segmentation problem in
terms of lens calibration by exploiting the plumbline constraint. We evaluate
our method on a dataset of various solar modules types containing a total of
408 solar cells with various defects. Our method robustly solves this task with
a median weighted Jaccard index of 94.47% and an $F_1$ score of 97.62%, both
indicating a very high similarity between automatically segmented and ground
truth solar cell masks.</span>

particular, we introduce a region-based Siamese Multi-Object Tracking network,
which we name SiamMOT. SiamMOT includes a motion model that estimates the
instance&#x27;s movement between two frames such that detected instances are
associated. To explore how the motion modelling affects its tracking
capability, we present two variants of Siamese tracker, one that implicitly
models motion and one that models it explicitly. We carry out extensive
quantitative experiments on three different MOT datasets: MOT17, TAO-person and
Caltech Roadside Pedestrians, showing the importance of motion modelling for
MOT and the ability of SiamMOT to substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art. Finally, SiamMOT also outperforms the winners of ACM MM&#x27;20
HiEve Grand Challenge on HiEve dataset. Moreover, SiamMOT is efficient, and it
runs at 17 FPS for 720P videos on a single modern GPU. Codes are available in

                                        <span>Depth cameras are emerging as a cornerstone modality with diverse
applications that directly or indirectly rely on measured depth, including
personal devices, robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Although time-of-flight
(ToF) methods have fueled these applications, the precision and robustness of
ToF methods is limited by relying on photon time-tagging or modulation after
photo-conversion. Successful optical modulation approaches have been restricted
fiber-coupled modulation with large coupling losses or interferometric
modulation with sub-cm range, and the precision gap between interferometric
methods and ToF methods is more than three orders of magnitudes. In this work,
we close this gap and propose a computational imaging method for all-optical
free-space correlation before photo-conversion that achieves micron-scale depth
resolution with robustness to surface reflectance and ambient light with
conventional silicon intensity sensors. To this end, we solve two technical
challenges: modulating at GHz rates and computational phase unwrapping. We
propose an imaging approach with resonant polarization modulators and devise a
novel optical dual-pass frequency-doubling which achieves high modulation
contrast at more than 10GHz. At the same time, centimeter-wave modulation
together with a small modulation bandwidth render existing phase unwrapping
methods ineffective. We tackle this problem with a neural phase unwrapping
method that exploits that adjacent wraps are often highly correlated. We
validate the proposed method in simulation and experimentally, where it
achieves micron-scale depth precision. We demonstrate precise depth sensing
independently of surface texture and ambient light and compare against existing
analog demodulation methods, which we outperform across all tested scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Text-based person search is a sub-task in the field of image retrieval, which
aims to retrieve target person images according to a given textual description.
The significant feature gap between two modalities makes this task very
challenging. Many existing methods attempt to utilize local alignment to
address this problem in the fine-grained level. However, most relevant methods
introduce additional models or complicated training and evaluation strategies,
which are hard to use in realistic scenarios. In order to facilitate the
practical application, we propose a simple but effective end-to-end learning
framework for text-based person search named TIPCB (i.e., Text-Image Part-based
Convolutional Baseline). Firstly, a novel dual-path local alignment network
structure is proposed to extract visual and textual local representations, in
which images are segmented horizontally and texts are aligned adaptively. Then,
we propose a multi-stage cross-modal matching strategy, which eliminates the
modality gap from three feature levels, including low level, local level and
global level. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely-used benchmark
dataset (CUHK-PEDES) and verify that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by 3.69%, 2.95% and 2.31% in terms of Top-1, Top-5 and
Top-10. Our code has been released in https://github.com/OrangeYHChen/TIPCB.</span>

fooled. As one of the mainstream methods, feature space targeted attacks
perturb images by modulating their intermediate feature maps, for the
discrepancy between the intermediate source and target features is minimized.
However, the current choice of pixel-wise Euclidean Distance to measure the
discrepancy is questionable because it unreasonably imposes a
spatial-consistency constraint on the source and target features. Intuitively,
an image can be categorized as &quot;cat&quot; no matter the cat is on the left or right
of the image. To address this issue, we propose to measure this discrepancy
using statistic alignment. Specifically, we design two novel approaches called
Pair-wise Alignment Attack and Global-wise Alignment Attack, which attempt to
measure similarities between feature maps by high-order statistics with
translation invariance. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the layer-wise
transferability with varied difficulties to obtain highly reliable attacks.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin. Our code is

autonomous driving systems. Different from previous approaches which are mostly
developed for lidars with high beam resolution, e.g. Velodyne HDL-64, this
paper proposes ground detection techniques applicable to much sparser point
cloud captured by lidars with low beam resolution, e.g. Velodyne VLP-16. The
approach is based on the RANSAC scheme of plane fitting. Inlier verification
for plane hypotheses is enhanced by exploiting the point-wise tangent, which is
a local feature available to compute regardless of the density of lidar beams.
Ground surface which is not perfectly planar is fitted by multiple
(specifically 4 in our implementation) disjoint plane regions. By assuming
these plane regions to be rectanglar and exploiting the integral image
technique, our approach approximately finds the optimal region partition and
plane hypotheses under the RANSAC scheme with real-time computational
complexity.</span>

                                        <span>Representation of semantic context and local details is the essential issue
for building modern semantic segmentation models. However, the
interrelationship between semantic context and local details is not well
explored in previous works. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Dual Sampling
Module (DDSM) to conduct dynamic affinity modeling and propagate semantic
context to local details, which yields a more discriminative representation.
Specifically, a dynamic sampling strategy is used to sparsely sample
representative pixels and channels in the higher layer, forming adaptive
compact support for each pixel and channel in the lower layer. The sampled
features with high semantics are aggregated according to the affinities and
then propagated to detailed lower-layer features, leading to a fine-grained
segmentation result with well-preserved boundaries. Experiment results on both
Cityscapes and Camvid datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed approach. Code and models will be available at

                                        <span>Deep neural networks offer numerous potential applications across geoscience,
for example, one could argue that they are the state-of-the-art method for
predicting faults in seismic datasets. In quantitative reservoir
characterization workflows, it is common to incorporate the uncertainty of
predictions thus such subsurface models should provide calibrated probabilities
and the associated uncertainties in their predictions. It has been shown that
popular Deep Learning-based models are often miscalibrated, and due to their
deterministic nature, provide no means to interpret the uncertainty of their
predictions. We compare three different approaches to obtaining probabilistic
models based on convolutional neural networks in a Bayesian formalism, namely
Deep Ensembles, Concrete Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian
(SWAG). These methods are consistently applied to fault detection case studies
where Deep Ensembles use independently trained models to provide fault
probabilities, Concrete Dropout represents an extension to the popular Dropout
technique to approximate Bayesian neural networks, and finally, we apply SWAG,
a recent method that is based on the Bayesian inference equivalence of
mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent. We provide quantitative results in
terms of model calibration and uncertainty representation, as well as
qualitative results on synthetic and real seismic datasets. Our results show
that the approximate Bayesian methods, Concrete Dropout and SWAG, both provide
well-calibrated predictions and uncertainty attributes at a lower computational
cost when compared to the baseline Deep Ensemble approach. The resulting
uncertainties also offer a possibility to further improve the model performance
as well as enhancing the interpretability of the models.</span>

                                        <span>Recent breakthroughs of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) extend the field&#x27;s
research scope towards a broader range of vision tasks and more diversified
search spaces. While existing NAS methods mostly design architectures on a
single task, algorithms that look beyond single-task search are surging to
pursue a more efficient and universal solution across various tasks. Many of
them leverage transfer learning and seek to preserve, reuse, and refine network
design knowledge to achieve higher efficiency in future tasks. However, the
enormous computational cost and experiment complexity of cross-task NAS are
imposing barriers for valuable research in this direction. Existing NAS
benchmarks all focus on one type of vision task, i.e., classification. In this
work, we propose TransNAS-Bench-101, a benchmark dataset containing network
performance across seven tasks, covering classification, regression,
pixel-level prediction, and self-supervised tasks. This diversity provides
opportunities to transfer NAS methods among tasks and allows for more complex
transfer schemes to evolve. We explore two fundamentally different types of
search space: cell-level search space and macro-level search space. With 7,352
backbones evaluated on seven tasks, 51,464 trained models with detailed
training information are provided. With TransNAS-Bench-101, we hope to
encourage the advent of exceptional NAS algorithms that raise cross-task search
efficiency and generalizability to the next level. Our dataset file will be
available at Mindspore, VEGA.</span>

                                        <span>Person re-identification (re-ID) tackles the problem of matching person
images with the same identity from different cameras. In practical
applications, due to the differences in camera performance and distance between
cameras and persons of interest, captured person images usually have various
resolutions. We name this problem as Cross-Resolution Person Re-identification
which brings a great challenge for matching correctly. In this paper, we
propose a Deep High-Resolution Pseudo-Siamese Framework (PS-HRNet) to solve the
above problem. Specifically, in order to restore the resolution of
low-resolution images and make reasonable use of different channel information
of feature maps, we introduce and innovate VDSR module with channel attention
(CA) mechanism, named as VDSR-CA. Then we reform the HRNet by designing a novel
representation head to extract discriminating features, named as HRNet-ReID. In
addition, a pseudo-siamese framework is constructed to reduce the difference of
feature distributions between low-resolution images and high-resolution images.
The experimental results on five cross-resolution person datasets verify the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, our proposed PS-HRNet improves 3.4\%, 6.2\%, 2.5\%,1.1\% and 4.2\% at
Rank-1 on MLR-Market-1501, MLR-CUHK03, MLR-VIPeR, MLR-DukeMTMC-reID, and CAVIAR
datasets, respectively. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Steerable CNN imposes the prior knowledge of transformation invariance or
equivariance in the network architecture to enhance the the network robustness
on geometry transformation of data and reduce overfitting. It has been an
intuitive and widely used technique to construct a steerable filter by
augmenting a filter with its transformed copies in the past decades, which is
named as filter transform in this paper. Recently, the problem of steerable CNN
has been studied from aspect of group representation theory, which reveals the
function space structure of a steerable kernel function. However, it is not yet
clear on how this theory is related to the filter transform technique. In this
paper, we show that kernel constructed by filter transform can also be
interpreted in the group representation theory. This interpretation help
complete the puzzle of steerable CNN theory and provides a novel and simple
approach to implement steerable convolution operators. Experiments are executed
on multiple datasets to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.</span>

consistency loss, which penalizes the inconsistency of predicted depths between
adjacent views; (ii) we propose a self-discovered mask to automatically
localize moving objects that violate the underlying static scene assumption and
cause noisy signals during training; (iii) we demonstrate the efficacy of each

results in both KITTI and NYUv2 datasets. Moreover, thanks to the capability of
scale-consistent prediction, we show that our monocular-trained deep networks
are readily integrated into the ORB-SLAM2 system for more robust and accurate

KITTI, and it generalizes well to the KAIST dataset without additional

                                        <span>The ubiquity of mobile phones makes mobile GUI understanding an important
task. Most previous works in this domain require human-created metadata of
screens (e.g. View Hierarchy) during inference, which unfortunately is often
not available or reliable enough for GUI understanding. Inspired by the
impressive success of Transformers in NLP tasks, targeting for purely
vision-based GUI understanding, we extend the concepts of Words/Sentence to
Pixel-Words/Screen-Sentence, and propose a mobile GUI understanding
architecture: Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentence (PW2SS). In analogy to the
individual Words, we define the Pixel-Words as atomic visual components (text
and graphic components), which are visually consistent and semantically clear
across screenshots of a large variety of design styles. The Pixel-Words
extracted from a screenshot are aggregated into Screen-Sentence with a Screen
Transformer proposed to model their relations. Since the Pixel-Words are
defined as atomic visual components, the ambiguity between their visual
appearance and semantics is dramatically reduced. We are able to make use of
metadata available in training data to auto-generate high-quality annotations
for Pixel-Words. A dataset, RICO-PW, of screenshots with Pixel-Words
annotations is built based on the public RICO dataset, which will be released
to help to address the lack of high-quality training data in this area. We
train a detector to extract Pixel-Words from screenshots on this dataset and
achieve metadata-free GUI understanding during inference. We conduct
experiments and show that Pixel-Words can be well extracted on RICO-PW and well
generalized to a new dataset, P2S-UI, collected by ourselves. The effectiveness
of PW2SS is further verified in the GUI understanding tasks including relation
prediction, clickability prediction, screen retrieval, and app type
classification.</span>

pre-trained network weights (filters). Network pruning with the information
preserving is formulated as a matrix sketch problem, which is efficiently
solved by the off-the-shelf Frequent Direction method. Our approach, referred
to as FilterSketch, encodes the second-order information of pre-trained
weights, which enables the representation capacity of pruned networks to be
recovered with a simple fine-tuning procedure. FilterSketch requires neither
training from scratch nor data-driven iterative optimization, leading to a
several-orders-of-magnitude reduction of time cost in the optimization of
pruning. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that FilterSketch reduces 63.3% of FLOPs
and prunes 59.9% of network parameters with negligible accuracy cost for
ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, it reduces 45.5% of FLOPs and removes 43.0% of

                                        <span>The rapid progress in 3D scene understanding has come with growing demand for
data; however, collecting and annotating 3D scenes (e.g. point clouds) are
notoriously hard. For example, the number of scenes (e.g. indoor rooms) that
can be accessed and scanned might be limited; even given sufficient data,
acquiring 3D labels (e.g. instance masks) requires intensive human labor. In
this paper, we explore data-efficient learning for 3D point cloud. As a first
step towards this direction, we propose Contrastive Scene Contexts, a 3D
pre-training method that makes use of both point-level correspondences and
spatial contexts in a scene. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on a
suite of benchmarks where training data or labels are scarce. Our study reveals
that exhaustive labelling of 3D point clouds might be unnecessary; and
remarkably, on ScanNet, even using 0.1% of point labels, we still achieve 89%
(instance segmentation) and 96% (semantic segmentation) of the baseline
performance that uses full annotations.</span>

of the payments in almost all the developing countries. The usage of mobile
phones is pretty ordinary in this present era. Mobile phones have become an
inseparable friend for many users, serving much more than just communication
tools. Every subsequent person is heavily relying on them due to multifaceted
usage and affordability. Every person wants to manage his/her daily
transactions and related issues by using his/her mobile phone. With the rise
and advancements of mobile-specific security, threats are evolving as well. In
this paper, we provide a survey of various security models for mobile phones.
We explore multiple proposed models of the mobile payment system (MPS), their
technologies and comparisons, payment methods, different security mechanisms
involved in MPS, and provide analysis of the encryption technologies,
authentication methods, and firewall in MPS. We also present current challenges
and future directions of mobile phone security.</span>

                                        <span>Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms have made substantial progress in learning
novel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query
instances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a
support set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume
that those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support
set. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject
to change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work
addresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under
Support/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled
from related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.
First, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines
and a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe
that well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable
drop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.
Finally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect
of DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal
Transport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT
with the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments
demonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of
research by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Tensor completion and robust principal component analysis have been widely
used in machine learning while the key problem relies on the minimization of a
tensor rank that is very challenging. A common way to tackle this difficulty is
to approximate the tensor rank with the $\ell_1-$norm of singular values based
on its Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD). Besides, the sparsity of a
tensor is also measured by its $\ell_1-$norm. However, the $\ell_1$ penalty is
essentially biased and thus the result will deviate. In order to sidestep the
bias, we propose a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate function and a novel
non-convex sparsity measure. In this new setting by using the concavity instead
of the convexity, a majorization minimization algorithm is further designed for
tensor completion and robust principal component analysis. Furthermore, we
analyze its theoretical properties. Finally, the experiments on natural and
hyperspectral images demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed
method.</span>

information and have recently demonstrated exemplary performance in the natural
language processing domain. Conventionally, the temporal action proposal
generation (TAPG) task is divided into two main sub-tasks: boundary prediction
and proposal confidence prediction, which rely on the frame-level dependencies
and proposal-level relationships separately. To capture the dependencies at
different levels of granularity, this paper intuitively presents a unified
temporal action proposal generation framework with original Transformers,
called TAPG Transformer, which consists of a Boundary Transformer and a
Proposal Transformer. Specifically, the Boundary Transformer captures long-term
temporal dependencies to predict precise boundary information and the Proposal
Transformer learns the rich inter-proposal relationships for reliable
confidence evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular
benchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and the results demonstrate that TAPG
Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing
action classifier, our method achieves remarkable performance on the temporal
action localization task. Codes and models will be available.</span>

against a large gallery in the encrypted domain. We require that the probe and
gallery images be represented in terms of a fixed-length representation, which
is typical for representations obtained from learned networks. Our encryption
scheme is agnostic to how the fixed-length representation is obtained and can
therefore be applied to any fixed-length representation in any application
domain. Our method, dubbed HERS (Homomorphically Encrypted Representation
Search), operates by (i) compressing the representation towards its estimated
intrinsic dimensionality with minimal loss of accuracy (ii) encrypting the
compressed representation using the proposed fully homomorphic encryption
scheme, and (iii) efficiently searching against a gallery of encrypted
representations directly in the encrypted domain, without decrypting them.
Numerical results on large galleries of face, fingerprint, and object datasets
such as ImageNet show that, for the first time, accurate and fast image search
within the encrypted domain is feasible at scale (500 seconds; $275\times$

task, especially when looking at emotions in animals. This paper describes the
process of designing a &quot;proof of concept&quot; system to recognize emotions in
horses. This system is formed by two elements, a detector and a model. The
detector is a faster region-based convolutional neural network that detects
horses in an image. The second one, the model, is a convolutional neural
network that predicts the emotion of those horses. These two models were
trained with multiple images of horses until they achieved high accuracy in
their tasks, creating therefore the desired system. 400 images of horses were
used to train both the detector and the model while 80 were used to validate
the system. Once the two components were validated they were combined into a
testable system that would detect equine emotions based on established
behavioral ethograms indicating emotional affect through head, neck, ear,
muzzle, and eye position. The system showed an accuracy of between 69% and 74%
on the validation set, demonstrating that it is possible to predict emotions in
animals using autonomous intelligent systems. It is a first &quot;proof of concept&quot;
approach that can be enhanced in many ways. Such a system has multiple
applications including further studies in the growing field of animal emotions
as well as in the veterinary field to determine the physical welfare of horses
or other livestock.</span>

                                        <span>Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and
crucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on
short-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level
predictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level
prediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves
along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic
Segment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be
more specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional
operation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets
adaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be
combined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform
powerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video
architecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several
video recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,
Something-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed
DSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.
For example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is
improved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400. Codes will be available.</span>

                                        <span>Food retrieval is an important task to perform analysis of food-related
information, where we are interested in retrieving relevant information about
the queried food item such as ingredients, cooking instructions, etc. In this
paper, we investigate cross-modal retrieval between food images and cooking
recipes. The goal is to learn an embedding of images and recipes in a common
feature space, such that the corresponding image-recipe embeddings lie close to
one another. Two major challenges in addressing this problem are 1) large
intra-variance and small inter-variance across cross-modal food data; and 2)
difficulties in obtaining discriminative recipe representations. To address
these two problems, we propose Semantic-Consistent and Attention-based Networks
(SCAN), which regularize the embeddings of the two modalities through aligning
output semantic probabilities. Besides, we exploit a self-attention mechanism
to improve the embedding of recipes. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed method on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset, and show that we can
outperform several state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval strategies for food
images and cooking recipes by a significant margin.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning affords enormous opportunities to augment the armamentarium of
biomedical imaging, albeit its design and implementation have potential flaws.
Fundamentally, most deep learning models are driven entirely by data without
consideration of any prior knowledge, which dramatically increases the
complexity of neural networks and limits the application scope and model
generalizability. Here we establish a geometry-informed deep learning framework
for ultra-sparse 3D tomographic image reconstruction. We introduce a novel
mechanism for integrating geometric priors of the imaging system. We
demonstrate that the seamless inclusion of known priors is essential to enhance
the performance of 3D volumetric computed tomography imaging with ultra-sparse
sampling. The study opens new avenues for data-driven biomedical imaging and
promises to provide substantially improved imaging tools for various clinical
imaging and image-guided interventions.</span>

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural architecture search (NAS) generally
guarantees better convergence yet suffers from the requirement of huge
computational resources compared with gradient-based approaches, due to the
rollout bottleneck -- exhaustive training for each sampled generation on proxy
tasks. In this paper, we propose a general pipeline to accelerate the
convergence of the rollout process as well as the RL process in NAS. It is
motivated by the interesting observation that both the architecture and the
parameter knowledge can be transferred between different experiments and even
different tasks. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware critic (value
function) in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to utilize the architecture
knowledge in previous experiments, which stabilizes the training process and
reduces the searching time by 4 times. Further, an architecture knowledge pool
together with a block similarity function is proposed to utilize parameter
knowledge and reduces the searching time by 2 times. It is the first to
introduce block-level weight sharing in RLbased NAS. The block similarity
function guarantees a 100% hitting ratio with strict fairness. Besides, we show
that a simply designed off-policy correction factor used in &quot;replay buffer&quot; in
RL optimization can further reduce half of the searching time. Experiments on
the Mobile Neural Architecture Search (MNAS) search space show the proposed
Fast Neural Architecture Search (FNAS) accelerates standard RL-based NAS
process by ~10x (e.g. ~256 2x2 TPUv2 x days / 20,000 GPU x hour -&gt; 2,000 GPU x
hour for MNAS), and guarantees better performance on various vision tasks.</span>

                                        <span>The rise of digitization of cultural documents offers large-scale contents,
opening the road for development of AI systems in order to preserve, search,
and deliver cultural heritage. To organize such cultural content also means to
classify them, a task that is very familiar to modern computer science.
Contextual information is often the key to structure such real world data, and
we propose to use it in form of a knowledge graph. Such a knowledge graph,
combined with content analysis, enhances the notion of proximity between
artworks so it improves the performances in classification tasks. In this
paper, we propose a novel use of a knowledge graph, that is constructed on
annotated data and pseudo-labeled data. With label propagation, we boost
artwork classification by training a model using a graph convolutional network,
relying on the relationships between entities of the knowledge graph. Following
a transductive learning framework, our experiments show that relying on a
knowledge graph modeling the relations between labeled data and unlabeled data
allows to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple classification tasks on
a dataset of paintings, and on a dataset of Buddha statues. Additionally, we
show state-of-the-art results for the difficult case of dealing with unbalanced
data, with the limitation of disregarding classes with extremely low degrees in
the knowledge graph.</span>

                                        <span>The automated analysis of medical images is currently limited by technical
and biological noise and bias. The same source tissue can be represented by
vastly different images if the image acquisition or processing protocols vary.
For an image analysis pipeline, it is crucial to compensate such biases to
avoid misinterpretations. Here, we evaluate, compare, and improve existing
generative model architectures to overcome domain shifts for immunofluorescence
(IF) and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained microscopy images. To determine
the performance of the generative models, the original and transformed images
were segmented or classified by deep neural networks that were trained only on
images of the target bias. In the scope of our analysis, U-Net cycleGANs
trained with an additional identity and an MS-SSIM-based loss and Fixed-Point
GANs trained with an additional structure loss led to the best results for the
IF and H&amp;E stained samples, respectively. Adapting the bias of the samples
significantly improved the pixel-level segmentation for human kidney glomeruli
and podocytes and improved the classification accuracy for human prostate
biopsies by up to 14%.</span>

                                        <span>Light can undergo complex interactions with multiple scene surfaces of
different material types before being reflected towards a detector. During this
transport, every surface reflection and propagation is encoded in the
properties of the photons that ultimately reach the detector, including travel
time, direction, intensity, wavelength and polarization. Conventional imaging
systems capture intensity by integrating over all other dimensions of the light
into a single quantity, hiding this rich scene information in the accumulated
measurements. Existing methods can untangle these into their spatial and
temporal dimensions, fueling geometric scene understanding. However, examining
polarimetric material properties jointly with geometric properties is an open
challenge that could enable unprecedented capabilities beyond geometric
understanding, allowing to incorporate material-dependent semantics. In this
work, we propose a computational light-transport imaging method that captures
the spatially- and temporally-resolved complete polarimetric response of a
scene. Our method hinges on a novel 7D tensor theory of light transport. We
discover low-rank structures in the polarimetric tensor dimension and propose a
data-driven rotating ellipsometry method that learns to exploit redundancy of
the polarimetric structures. We instantiate our theory in two imaging
prototypes: spatio-polarimetric imaging and coaxial temporal-polarimetric
imaging. This allows us to decompose scene light transport into temporal,
spatial, and complete polarimetric dimensions that unveil scene properties
hidden to conventional methods. We validate the applicability of our method on
diverse tasks, including shape reconstruction with subsurface scattering,
seeing through scattering medium, untangling multi-bounce light transport,
breaking metamerism with polarization, and spatio-polarimetric decomposition of
crystals.</span>

                                        <span>Early-stage plant density is an essential trait that determines the fate of a
genotype under given environmental conditions and management practices. The use
of RGB images taken from UAVs may replace traditional visual counting in fields
with improved throughput, accuracy and access to plant localization. However,
high-resolution (HR) images are required to detect small plants present at
early stages. This study explores the impact of image ground sampling distance
(GSD) on the performances of maize plant detection at 3-5 leaves stage using
Faster-RCNN. Data collected at HR (GSD&#x3D;0.3cm) over 6 contrasted sites were used
for model training. Two additional sites with images acquired both at high and
low (GSD&#x3D;0.6cm) resolution were used for model evaluation. Results show that
Faster-RCNN achieved very good plant detection and counting (rRMSE&#x3D;0.08)
performances when native HR images are used both for training and validation.
Similarly, good performances were observed (rRMSE&#x3D;0.11) when the model is
trained over synthetic low-resolution (LR) images obtained by down-sampling the
native training HR images, and applied to the synthetic LR validation images.
Conversely, poor performances are obtained when the model is trained on a given
spatial resolution and applied to another spatial resolution. Training on a mix
of HR and LR images allows to get very good performances on the native HR
(rRMSE&#x3D;0.06) and synthetic LR (rRMSE&#x3D;0.10) images. However, very low
performances are still observed over the native LR images (rRMSE&#x3D;0.48), mainly
due to the poor quality of the native LR images. Finally, an advanced
super-resolution method based on GAN (generative adversarial network) that
introduces additional textural information derived from the native HR images
was applied to the native LR validation images. Results show some significant
improvement (rRMSE&#x3D;0.22) compared to bicubic up-sampling approach.</span>

                                        <span>Monocular (relative or metric) depth estimation is a critical task for
various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and image
editing. In recent years, with the increasing availability of mobile devices,
accurate and mobile-friendly depth models have gained importance. Increasingly
accurate models typically require more computational resources, which inhibits
the use of such models on mobile devices. The mobile use case is arguably the
most unrestricted one, which requires highly accurate yet mobile-friendly
architectures. Therefore, we try to answer the following question: How can we
improve a model without adding further complexity (i.e. parameters)? Towards
this end, we systematically explore the design space of a relative depth
estimation model from various dimensions and we show, with key design choices
and ablation studies, even an existing architecture can reach highly
competitive performance to the state of the art, with a fraction of the
complexity. Our study spans an in-depth backbone model selection process,
knowledge distillation, intermediate predictions, model pruning and loss
rebalancing. We show that our model, using only DIW as the supervisory dataset,
achieves 0.1156 WHDR on DIW with 2.6M parameters and reaches 37 FPS on a mobile
GPU, without pruning or hardware-specific optimization. A pruned version of our
model achieves 0.1208 WHDR on DIW with 1M parameters and reaches 44 FPS on a
mobile GPU.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate layout estimation is crucial for planning and navigation in robotics
applications, such as self-driving. In this paper, we introduce the Stereo
Bird&#x27;s Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for
estimation of bird&#x27;s eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our
network reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep
learning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth
estimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good
internal bird&#x27;s eye view feature representation is effective for layout
estimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using
the features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird&#x27;s eye view
coordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene
structure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input
images and their features to the bird&#x27;s eye view. This gives us fine-grained
texture information. Concatenating IPM features with the projected feature
volume creates a rich bird&#x27;s eye view representation which is useful for
spatial reasoning. We use this representation to estimate the BEV semantic map.
Additionally, we show that using the IPM features as a supervisory signal for
stereo features can give an improvement in performance. We demonstrate our
approach on two datasets:the KITTI dataset and a synthetically generated
dataset from the CARLA simulator. For both of these datasets, we establish
state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques.</span>

comprehensive visual understanding of machines. While detecting non-temporal
HOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely
even for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)
from a single video frame, where the neighboring frames play an essential role.
However, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been
used to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing
without temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal
information. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common
action detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a
feature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective
architecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal
information such as human and object trajectories, correctly-localized visual
features, and spatial-temporal masking pose features. We construct a new video
HOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid
baseline.</span>

(NAS) paradigm -- searching with random labels (RLNAS). The task sounds
counter-intuitive for most existing NAS algorithms since random label provides
few information on the performance of each candidate architecture. Instead, we
propose a novel NAS framework based on ease-of-convergence hypothesis, which
requires only random labels during searching. The algorithm involves two steps:
first, we train a SuperNet using random labels; second, from the SuperNet we
extract the sub-network whose weights change most significantly during the
training. Extensive experiments are evaluated on multiple datasets (e.g.
NAS-Bench-201 and ImageNet) and multiple search spaces (e.g. DARTS-like and
MobileNet-like). Very surprisingly, RLNAS achieves comparable or even better
results compared with state-of-the-art NAS methods such as PC-DARTS, Single
Path One-Shot, even though the counterparts utilize full ground truth labels

                                        <span>Cluster discrimination is an effective pretext task for unsupervised
representation learning, which often consists of two phases: clustering and
discrimination. Clustering is to assign each instance a pseudo label that will
be used to learn representations in discrimination. The main challenge resides
in clustering since many prevalent clustering methods (e.g., k-means) have to
run in a batch mode that goes multiple iterations over the whole data.
Recently, a balanced online clustering method, i.e., SwAV, is proposed for
representation learning. However, the assignment is optimized within only a
small subset of data, which can be suboptimal. To address these challenges, we
first investigate the objective of clustering-based representation learning
from the perspective of distance metric learning. Based on this, we propose a
novel clustering-based pretext task with online \textbf{Co}nstrained
\textbf{K}-m\textbf{e}ans (\textbf{CoKe}) to learn representations and
relations between instances simultaneously. Compared with the balanced
clustering that each cluster has exactly the same size, we only constrain the
minimum size of clusters to flexibly capture the inherent data structure. More
importantly, our online assignment method has a theoretical guarantee to
approach the global optimum. Finally, two variance reduction strategies are
proposed to make the clustering robust for different augmentations. Without
keeping representations of instances, the data is accessed in an online mode in
CoKe while a single view of instances at each iteration is sufficient to
demonstrate a better performance than contrastive learning methods relying on
two views. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify the efficacy of our
proposal. Code will be released.</span>

unavailable in training by exploring common latent semantic representation in
samples. However, most methods neglected the connotative relation and
extensional relation between the action classes, which leads to the poor
generalization ability of the zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the learned
classifier incline to predict the samples of seen class, which leads to poor
classification performance. To solve the above problems, we propose a two-stage
deep neural network for zero-shot action recognition, which consists of a
feature generation sub-network serving as the sampling stage and a graph
attention sub-network serving as the classification stage. In the sampling
stage, we utilize a generative adversarial networks (GAN) trained by action
features and word vectors of seen classes to synthesize the action features of
unseen classes, which can balance the training sample data of seen classes and
unseen classes. In the classification stage, we construct a knowledge graph
(KG) based on the relationship between word vectors of action classes and
related objects, and propose a graph convolution network (GCN) based on
attention mechanism, which dynamically updates the relationship between action
classes and objects, and enhances the generalization ability of zero-shot
learning. In both stages, we all use word vectors as bridges for feature
generation and classifier generalization from seen classes to unseen classes.
We compare our method with state-of-the-art methods on UCF101 and HMDB51
datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the
classification performance of the trained classifier and achieves higher
accuracy.</span>

and robot navigation. Although a number of point cloud based methods have been
proposed and achieved promising results, few of them take the size difference
of objects into consideration. For small objects like pedestrians and vehicles,
large receptive fields will capture unrelated information, while small
receptive fields would fail to encode complete geometric information for large
objects such as buildings. We argue that fixed receptive fields are not well

Module (ARFM), which can adaptively adjust the size of the receptive field

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as bio-inspired energy-efficient neural
networks, have attracted great attentions from researchers and industry. The
most efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,
the conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,
which impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal
conversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose
Rate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,
enabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose
an optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source
ANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time
can be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised
ANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast
reasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,
PreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6x faster
reasoning performance under 0.265x energy consumption of the typical method.

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose an effective method for fast and accurate scene
parsing called Bidirectional Alignment Network (BiAlignNet). Previously, one
representative work BiSeNet~\cite{bisenet} uses two different paths (Context
Path and Spatial Path) to achieve balanced learning of semantics and details,
respectively. However, the relationship between the two paths is not well
explored. We argue that both paths can benefit each other in a complementary
way. Motivated by this, we propose a novel network by aligning two-path
information into each other through a learned flow field. To avoid the noise
and semantic gaps, we introduce a Gated Flow Alignment Module to align both
features in a bidirectional way. Moreover, to make the Spatial Path learn more
detailed information, we present an edge-guided hard pixel mining loss to
supervise the aligned learning process. Our method achieves 80.1\% and 78.5\%
mIoU in validation and test set of Cityscapes while running at 30 FPS with full
resolution inputs. Code and models will be available at

both objects and scenes. Inspired by dilation and erosion from morphological
image processing techniques, we treat the pixel level segmentation problems as
squeezing object boundary. From this perspective, we propose \textbf{Boundary
Squeeze} module: a novel and efficient module that squeezes the object boundary
from both inner and outer directions which leads to precise mask
representation. To generate such squeezed representation, we propose a new
bidirectionally flow-based warping process and design specific loss signals to
supervise the learning process. Boundary Squeeze Module can be easily applied
to both instance and semantic segmentation tasks as a plug-and-play module by
building on top of existing models. We show that our simple yet effective
design can lead to high qualitative results on several different datasets and
we also provide several different metrics on boundary to prove the
effectiveness over previous work. Moreover, the proposed module is
light-weighted and thus has potential for practical usage. Our method yields
large gains on COCO, Cityscapes, for both instance and semantic segmentation
and outperforms previous state-of-the-art PointRend in both accuracy and speed

                                        <span>Stroke order and velocity are helpful features in the fields of signature
verification, handwriting recognition, and handwriting synthesis. Recovering
these features from offline handwritten text is a challenging and well-studied
problem. We propose a new model called TRACE (Trajectory Recovery by an
Adaptively-trained Convolutional Encoder). TRACE is a differentiable approach
that uses a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) to infer temporal
stroke information from long lines of offline handwritten text with many
characters and dynamic time warping (DTW) to align predictions and ground truth
points. TRACE is perhaps the first system to be trained end-to-end on entire
lines of text of arbitrary width and does not require the use of dynamic
exemplars. Moreover, the system does not require images to undergo any
pre-processing, nor do the predictions require any post-processing.
Consequently, the recovered trajectory is differentiable and can be used as a
loss function for other tasks, including synthesizing offline handwritten text.

We demonstrate that temporal stroke information recovered by TRACE from
offline data can be used for handwriting synthesis and establish the first
benchmarks for a stroke trajectory recovery system trained on the IAM online
handwriting dataset.</span>

recognized issues, such as spectral distortion and insufficient spatial texture
enhancement, we propose a novel pan-sharpening convolutional neural network
based on a high-pass modification block. Different from existing methods, the
proposed block is designed to learn the high-pass information, leading to
enhance spatial information in each band of the multi-spectral-resolution
images. To facilitate the generation of visually appealing pan-sharpened

based on high-level features in the near-infrared space. Experiments

                                        <span>The Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved remarkable success in graph data
representation. However, the previous work only considered the ideal balanced
dataset, and the practical imbalanced dataset was rarely considered, which, on
the contrary, is of more significance for the application of GNN. Traditional
methods such as resampling, reweighting and synthetic samples that deal with
imbalanced datasets are no longer applicable in GNN. Ensemble models can handle
imbalanced datasets better compared with single estimator. Besides, ensemble
learning can achieve higher estimation accuracy and has better reliability
compared with the single estimator. In this paper, we propose an ensemble model
called AdaGCN, which uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as the base
estimator during adaptive boosting. In AdaGCN, a higher weight will be set for
the training samples that are not properly classified by the previous
classifier, and transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost and
increase fitting capability. Experiments show that the AdaGCN model we proposed
achieves better performance than GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, N-GCN and the most of
advanced reweighting and resampling methods on synthetic imbalanced datasets,
with an average improvement of 4.3%. Our model also improves state-of-the-art

is robust to viewing conditions and does not require a detailed model of the
scene. This method meets the growing need of easy deployment of robotics or
augmented reality applications in any environments, especially those for which
no accurate 3D model nor huge amount of ground truth data are available. It
exploits the ability of deep learning techniques to reliably detect objects
regardless of viewing conditions. Previous works have also shown that
abstracting the geometry of a scene of objects by an ellipsoid cloud allows to
compute the camera pose accurately enough for various application needs. Though
promising, these approaches use the ellipses fitted to the detection bounding
boxes as an approximation of the imaged objects. In this paper, we go one step
further and propose a learning-based method which detects improved elliptic
approximations of objects which are coherent with the 3D ellipsoid in terms of
perspective projection. Experiments prove that the accuracy of the computed
pose significantly increases thanks to our method and is more robust to the
variability of the boundaries of the detection boxes. This is achieved with
very little effort in terms of training data acquisition -- a few hundred
calibrated images of which only three need manual object annotation. Code and

properly diagnosing gliomas is one of the most daunting and significant
analysis tasks in modern-day medicine. Our primary focus is on working with
different approaches to perform the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal
MRI scans. Now, the quantity, variability of the data used for training has
always been considered to be crucial for developing excellent models. Hence, we
also want to experiment with Knowledge Distillation techniques.</span>

sequence of yes/no questions (Questioner) and makes a final guess (Guesser)
about a target object in an image, based on answers from player B (Oracle).
Based on this dialog history between the Questioner and the Oracle, a Guesser
makes a final guess of the target object. Previous baseline Oracle model
encodes no visual information in the model, and it cannot fully understand
complex questions about color, shape, relationships and so on. Most existing
work for Guesser encode the dialog history as a whole and train the Guesser
models from scratch on the GuessWhat?! dataset. This is problematic since
language encoder tend to forget long-term history and the GuessWhat?! data is
sparse in terms of learning visual grounding of objects. Previous work for
Questioner introduces state tracking mechanism into the model, but it is
learned as a soft intermediates without any prior vision-linguistic insights.
To bridge these gaps, in this paper we propose Vilbert-based Oracle, Guesser
and Questioner, which are all built on top of pretrained vision-linguistic
model, Vilbert. We introduce two-way background/target fusion mechanism into
Vilbert-Oracle to account for both intra and inter-object questions. We propose
a unified framework for Vilbert-Guesser and Vilbert-Questioner, where
state-estimator is introduced to best utilize Vilbert&#x27;s power on single-turn
referring expression comprehension. Experimental results show that our proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models significantly by 7%, 10%, 12% for
Oracle, Guesser and End-to-End Questioner respectively.</span>

great importance for various applications such as robotics, inter-human and
human-object interaction in augmented reality. However, 360{\deg} video SHD has
been seldom discussed in the computer vision community due to a lack of
datasets with large-scale omnidirectional videos and rich annotations. To this
end, we propose SHD360, the first 360{\deg} video SHD dataset collecting
various real-life daily scenes, providing six-level hierarchical annotations
for 6,268 key frames uniformly sampled from 37,403 omnidirectional video frames
at 4K resolution. Specifically, each collected key frame is labeled with a
super-class, a sub-class, associated attributes (e.g., geometrical distortion),
bounding boxes and per-pixel object-/instance-level masks. As a result, our
SHD360 contains totally 16,238 salient human instances with manually annotated
pixel-wise ground truth. Since so far there is no method proposed for 360{\deg}
SHD, we systematically benchmark 11 representative state-of-the-art salient
object detection (SOD) approaches on our SHD360, and explore key issues derived
from extensive experimenting results. We hope our proposed dataset and
benchmark could serve as a good starting point for advancing human-centric
researches towards 360{\deg} panoramic data. Our dataset and benchmark will be
publicly available at https://github.com/PanoAsh/SHD360.</span>

underlying vision-and-language navigation (VLN), but in addition, they need to
be trained to handle the dynamic nature of dialogue. However, research in
Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (CVDN), where a navigator interacts
with a guide in natural language in order to reach a goal, treats the dialogue
history as a VLN-style static instruction. In this paper, we present VISITRON,
a navigator better suited to the interactive regime inherent to CVDN by being
trained to: i) identify and associate object-level concepts and semantics
between the environment and dialogue history, ii) identify when to interact vs.
navigate via imitation learning of a binary classification head. We perform
extensive ablations with VISITRON to gain empirical insights and improve
performance on CVDN. VISITRON is competitive with models on the static CVDN
leaderboard. We also propose a generalized interactive regime to fine-tune and
evaluate VISITRON and future such models with pre-trained guides for
adaptability.</span>

                                        <span>There is increasing evidence on the importance of brain morphology in
predicting and classifying mental disorders. However, the vast majority of
current shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not
successfully capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the
past works do not include interactions between these structures and exposure
factors. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of paramount interest in
heterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma exposure interacts
with brain shape changes to influence behavior. We propose a comprehensive
framework that overcomes these limitations by representing brain substructures
as continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape differences
using elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute shape
summaries of subcortical data and represent individual shapes by their
principal scores. These representations allow visualization tools that help
localize changes when these PCs are varied. Subsequently, these PCs, the
auxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are used for regression
modeling. We apply our method to data from the Grady Trauma Project, where the
goal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD using shapes of brain
substructures. Our analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power
under the elastic shape analysis than widely used approaches such as
vertex-wise shape analysis and even volumetric analysis. It helped identify
local deformations in brain shapes related to change in PTSD severity. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis approaches that can
seamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for improved
accuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape
and additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when
modeling clinical outcomes.</span>

available in disparate, typically unstructured, formats. Knowledge graphs can
capture this information and its context using RDF triples represented by
entities and relations. Sparse or inaccurate threat information, however, leads
to challenges such as incomplete or erroneous triples. Generic information
extraction (IE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully
guarantee domain-specific context. This paper proposes a system to generate a
Malware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge
graph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset (MT40K\footnote{ Anonymous
GitHub link: https://github.com/malkg-researcher/MalKG}) contains approximately
40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. For
ground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027
triples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. We demonstrate
the intelligence prediction of MalKG using two use cases. Predicting malware
threat information using the benchmark model achieves 80.4 for the hits@10
metric (predicts the top 10 options for an information class), and 0.75 for the
MRR (mean reciprocal rank). We also propose an automated, contextual framework
for information extraction, both manually and automatically, at the sentence
level from 1,100 malware threat reports and from the common vulnerabilities and
exposures (CVE) database.</span>

E-commerce, more and more researchers pay attention to multi-behavior
recommender systems that utilize interaction data of other auxiliary behaviors
such as view and cart. To address these challenges in heterogeneous scenarios,
non-sampling methods have shown superiority over negative sampling methods.
However, two observations are usually ignored in existing state-of-the-art
non-sampling methods based on binary regression: (1) users have different
preference strengths for different items, so they cannot be measured simply by
binary implicit data; (2) the dependency across multiple behaviors varies for
different users and items. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel
non-sampling learning framework named \underline{C}riterion-guided
\underline{H}eterogeneous \underline{C}ollaborative \underline{F}iltering
(CHCF). CHCF introduces both upper and lower bounds to indicate selection
criteria, which will guide user preference learning. Besides, CHCF integrates
criterion learning and user preference learning into a unified framework, which
can be trained jointly for the interaction prediction on target behavior. We
further theoretically demonstrate that the optimization of Collaborative Metric
Learning can be approximately achieved by CHCF learning framework in a
non-sampling form effectively. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
show that CHCF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous
scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Personalization of natural language generation plays a vital role in a large
spectrum of tasks, such as explainable recommendation, review summarization and
dialog systems. In these tasks, user and item IDs are important identifiers for
personalization. Transformer, which is demonstrated with strong language
modeling capability, however, is not personalized and fails to make use of the
user and item IDs since the ID tokens are not even in the same semantic space
as the words. To address this problem, we present a PErsonalized Transformer
for Explainable Recommendation (PETER), on which we design a simple and
effective learning objective that utilizes the IDs to predict the words in the
target explanation, so as to endow the IDs with linguistic meanings and to
achieve personalized Transformer. Besides generating explanations, PETER can
also make recommendations, which makes it a unified model for the whole
recommendation-explanation pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our small

                                        <span>Existing topic modeling and text segmentation methodologies generally require
large datasets for training, limiting their capabilities when only small
collections of text are available. In this work, we reexamine the inter-related
problems of &quot;topic identification&quot; and &quot;text segmentation&quot; for sparse document
learning, when there is a single new text of interest. In developing a
methodology to handle single documents, we face two major challenges. First is
sparse information: with access to only one document, we cannot train
traditional topic models or deep learning algorithms. Second is significant
noise: a considerable portion of words in any single document will produce only
noise and not help discern topics or segments. To tackle these issues, we
design an unsupervised, computationally efficient methodology called BATS:
Biclustering Approach to Topic modeling and Segmentation. BATS leverages three
key ideas to simultaneously identify topics and segment text: (i) a new
mechanism that uses word order information to reduce sample complexity, (ii) a
statistically sound graph-based biclustering technique that identifies latent
structures of words and sentences, and (iii) a collection of effective
heuristics that remove noise words and award important words to further improve
performance. Experiments on four datasets show that our approach outperforms
several state-of-the-art baselines when considering topic coherence, topic
diversity, segmentation, and runtime comparison metrics.</span>

blocks of a large network whose structure contains important information on the

                                        <span>Factorization machine (FM) is a prevalent approach to modeling pairwise
(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into
the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model
arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has
demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

one of the most important parts of largescale data mining techniques. In this
paper, we propose a Hybrid Movie Recommender System (HMRS) based on Resource
Allocation to improve the accuracy of recommendation and solve the cold start
problem for a new movie. HMRS-RA uses a self-organizing mapping neural network
to clustering the users into N clusters. The users&#x27; preferences are different

Content-Based Method for solving the cold start problem for a new movie and a
Collaborative Filtering model besides the demographic information of users. The

correlations between two signals propagating forward through a deep ReLU
network with correlated weights. Signals become highly correlated in deep ReLU
networks with uncorrelated weights. We show that ReLU networks with
anti-correlated weights can avoid this fate and have a chaotic phase where the
signal correlations saturate below unity. Consistent with this analysis, we
find that networks initialized with anti-correlated weights can train faster
(in a teacher-student setting) by taking advantage of the increased
expressivity in the chaotic phase. Combining this with a previously proposed
strategy of using an asymmetric initialization to reduce dead node probability,
we propose an initialization scheme that allows faster training and learning
than the best-known initializations.</span>

                                        <span>Analogy-making is at the core of human intelligence and creativity with
applications to such diverse tasks as commonsense reasoning, learning, language
acquisition, and story telling. This paper contributes to the foundations of
artificial general intelligence by introducing from first principles an
abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions of the form &#x60;$a$ is to
$b$ what $c$ is to $d$&#x27; in the general setting of universal algebra. This
enables us to compare mathematical objects possibly across different domains in
a uniform way which is crucial for AI-systems. The main idea is to define
solutions to analogical equations in terms of maximal sets of algebraic
justifications, which amounts to deriving abstract terms of concrete elements
from a &#x60;known&#x27; source domain which can then be instantiated in an &#x60;unknown&#x27;
target domain to obtain analogous elements. It turns out that our notion of
analogical proportions has appealing mathematical properties. For example, we
show that analogical proportions preserve functional dependencies across
different domains, which is desirable. We study Lepage&#x27;s axioms of analogical
proportions and argue why we disagree with his symmetry, central permutation,
strong reflexivity, and strong determinism axioms. We compare our framework
with two prominent and recently introduced frameworks of analogical proportions
from the literature in the concrete domains of sets and numbers, and we show
that in each case we either disagree with the notion from the literature
justified by some plausible counter-example or we can show that our model
yields strictly more reasonable solutions. This provides evidence for its
applicability. In a broader sense, this paper is a first step towards a theory
of analogical reasoning and learning systems with potential applications to
fundamental AI-problems like commonsense reasoning and computational learning
and creativity.</span>

                                        <span>Tensor completion and robust principal component analysis have been widely
used in machine learning while the key problem relies on the minimization of a
tensor rank that is very challenging. A common way to tackle this difficulty is
to approximate the tensor rank with the $\ell_1-$norm of singular values based
on its Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD). Besides, the sparsity of a
tensor is also measured by its $\ell_1-$norm. However, the $\ell_1$ penalty is
essentially biased and thus the result will deviate. In order to sidestep the
bias, we propose a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate function and a novel
non-convex sparsity measure. In this new setting by using the concavity instead
of the convexity, a majorization minimization algorithm is further designed for
tensor completion and robust principal component analysis. Furthermore, we
analyze its theoretical properties. Finally, the experiments on natural and
hyperspectral images demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed
method.</span>

However, the type of EEG data constitutes an obstacle for cross-individual EEG

deep-learning framework denoted as a dynamic entropy-based pattern learning
(DEPL) to abstract informative indicators pertaining to the neurophysiological
features among multiple individuals. DEPL enhanced the capability of
representations generated by a deep convolutional neural network by modelling
the interdependencies between the cortical locations of dynamical entropy based
features. The effectiveness of the DEPL has been validated with two public

paradigm has been applied. Numerous experiments on EEG emotion recognition
demonstrate that the proposed DEPL is superior to those traditional machine

important in the study of biomacromolecules. Laser Induced Breakdown
Spectroscopy (LIBS) uses high energy laser-pulses for ablation of chemical
compounds whose radiated spectra are captured and recorded to reveal molecular
structure. Spectral peaks and noise from LIBS are impacted by experimental
protocols. Current methods for LIBS spectral analysis achieves promising
results using PCA, a linear method. It is well-known that the underlying
physical processes behind LIBS are highly nonlinear. Our work set out to
understand the impact of LIBS spectra on suitable neighborhood size over which
to consider pattern phenomena, if nonlinear methods capture pattern phenomena
with increased efficacy, and how they improve classification and identification
of compounds. We analyzed four amino acids, polysaccharide, and a control
group, water. We developed an information theoretic method for measurement of
LIBS energy spectra, implemented manifold methods for nonlinear dimensionality
reduction, and found while clustering results were not statistically
significantly different, nonlinear methods lead to increased classification
accuracy. Moreover, our approach uncovered the contribution of micro-wells

frequency, which is called frequency principle or spectral bias. This frequency
principle sheds light on a high-frequency curse of DNNs -- difficult to learn
high-frequency information. Inspired by the frequency principle, a series of
works are devoted to develop algorithms for overcoming the high-frequency
curse. A natural question arises: what is the upper limit of the decaying rate
w.r.t. frequency when one trains a DNN? In this work, our theory, confirmed by
numerical experiments, suggests that there is a critical decaying rate w.r.t.
frequency in DNN training. Below the upper limit of the decaying rate, the DNN
interpolates the training data by a function with a certain regularity.
However, above the upper limit, the DNN interpolates the training data by a
trivial function, i.e., a function is only non-zero at training data points.
Our results indicate a better way to overcome the high-frequency curse is to
design a proper pre-condition approach to shift high-frequency information to
low-frequency one, which coincides with several previous developed algorithms
for fast learning high-frequency information. More importantly, this work
rigorously proves that the high-frequency curse is an intrinsic difficulty of
DNNs.</span>

non-sensitive target attribute, can reveal sensitive attributes of their input
data; through features of different granularity extracted by the classifier.
We, taking a step forward, show that deep classifiers can be trained to
secretly encode a sensitive attribute of users&#x27; input data, at inference time,
into the classifier&#x27;s outputs for the target attribute. An attack that works
even if users have a white-box view of the classifier, and can keep all
internal representations hidden except for the classifier&#x27;s estimation of the
target attribute. We introduce an information-theoretical formulation of such
adversaries and present efficient empirical implementations for training
honest-but-curious (HBC) classifiers based on this formulation: deep models
that can be accurate in predicting the target attribute, but also can utilize
their outputs to secretly encode a sensitive attribute. Our evaluations on
several tasks in real-world datasets show that a semi-trusted server can build
a classifier that is not only perfectly honest but also accurately curious. Our
work highlights a vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious machine
learning service providers to attack their user&#x27;s privacy in several seemingly
safe scenarios; such as encrypted inferences, computations at the edge, or
private knowledge distillation. We conclude by showing the difficulties in
distinguishing between standard and HBC classifiers and discussing potential
proactive defenses against this vulnerability of deep classifiers.</span>

in a union of several submanifolds. We propose a sparsity-driven latent space

to enforce sparsity in the latent space. SDLSS allows the range-space of the
generator to be considered as a union-of-submanifolds. We also derive the
sample complexity bounds within the SDLSS framework for the linear measurement
model. The results demonstrate that for a higher degree of compression, the
SDLSS method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art method. We first
consider a comparison between linear and nonlinear sensing mechanisms on
Fashion-MNIST dataset and show that the learned nonlinear version is superior
to the linear one. Subsequent comparisons with the deep compressive sensing
(DCS) framework proposed in the literature are reported. We also consider the
effect of the dimension of the latent space and the sparsity factor in
validating the SDLSS framework. Performance quantification is carried out by
employing three objective metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
structural similarity index metric (SSIM), and reconstruction error (RE).</span>

                                        <span>Interactive robots navigating photo-realistic environments face challenges
underlying vision-and-language navigation (VLN), but in addition, they need to
be trained to handle the dynamic nature of dialogue. However, research in
Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (CVDN), where a navigator interacts
with a guide in natural language in order to reach a goal, treats the dialogue
history as a VLN-style static instruction. In this paper, we present VISITRON,
a navigator better suited to the interactive regime inherent to CVDN by being
trained to: i) identify and associate object-level concepts and semantics
between the environment and dialogue history, ii) identify when to interact vs.
navigate via imitation learning of a binary classification head. We perform
extensive ablations with VISITRON to gain empirical insights and improve
performance on CVDN. VISITRON is competitive with models on the static CVDN
leaderboard. We also propose a generalized interactive regime to fine-tune and
evaluate VISITRON and future such models with pre-trained guides for
adaptability.</span>

                                        <span>The Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved remarkable success in graph data
representation. However, the previous work only considered the ideal balanced
dataset, and the practical imbalanced dataset was rarely considered, which, on
the contrary, is of more significance for the application of GNN. Traditional
methods such as resampling, reweighting and synthetic samples that deal with
imbalanced datasets are no longer applicable in GNN. Ensemble models can handle
imbalanced datasets better compared with single estimator. Besides, ensemble
learning can achieve higher estimation accuracy and has better reliability
compared with the single estimator. In this paper, we propose an ensemble model
called AdaGCN, which uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as the base
estimator during adaptive boosting. In AdaGCN, a higher weight will be set for
the training samples that are not properly classified by the previous
classifier, and transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost and
increase fitting capability. Experiments show that the AdaGCN model we proposed
achieves better performance than GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, N-GCN and the most of
advanced reweighting and resampling methods on synthetic imbalanced datasets,
with an average improvement of 4.3%. Our model also improves state-of-the-art
baselines on all of the challenging node classification tasks we consider:

                                        <span>Large amounts of threat intelligence information about malware attacks are
available in disparate, typically unstructured, formats. Knowledge graphs can
capture this information and its context using RDF triples represented by
entities and relations. Sparse or inaccurate threat information, however, leads
to challenges such as incomplete or erroneous triples. Generic information
extraction (IE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully
guarantee domain-specific context. This paper proposes a system to generate a
Malware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge
graph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset (MT40K\footnote{ Anonymous
GitHub link: https://github.com/malkg-researcher/MalKG}) contains approximately
40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. For
ground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027
triples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. We demonstrate
the intelligence prediction of MalKG using two use cases. Predicting malware
threat information using the benchmark model achieves 80.4 for the hits@10
metric (predicts the top 10 options for an information class), and 0.75 for the
MRR (mean reciprocal rank). We also propose an automated, contextual framework
for information extraction, both manually and automatically, at the sentence
level from 1,100 malware threat reports and from the common vulnerabilities and
exposures (CVE) database.</span>

tasks that may assist a decision-making process. We focused on the problem of
wells location optimization and two tasks within it: improving the quality of
oil production estimation and estimation of reservoir characteristics for
appropriate wells allocation and parametrization, using machine learning
methods. For oil production estimation, we implemented and investigated the
quality of forecasting models: physics-based, pure data-driven, and hybrid one.
The CRMIP model was chosen as a physics-based approach. We compare it with the
machine learning and hybrid methods in a frame of oil production forecasting
task. In the investigation of reservoir characteristics for wells location
choice, we automated the seismic analysis using evolutionary identification of
convolutional neural network for the reservoir detection. The Volve oil field
dataset was used as a case study to conduct the experiments. The implemented
approaches can be used to analyze different oil fields or adapted to similar

with the help of numerical models. The high computational cost of numerical
simulations, however, has inhibited the approach especially when it deals with
the dynamic properties of power grids such as frequency synchronization. In
this study, we investigate machine learning techniques to estimate the
stability of power grid synchronization. We test three different machine
learning algorithms -- random forest, support vector machine, and artificial
neural network -- training them with two different types of synthetic power
grids consisting of homogeneous and heterogeneous input-power distribution,
respectively. We find that the three machine learning models better predict the
synchronization stability of power-grid nodes when they are trained with the
heterogeneous input-power distribution than the homogeneous one. With the
real-world power grids of Great Britain, Spain, France, and Germany, we also
demonstrate that the machine learning algorithms trained on synthetic power
grids are transferable to the stability prediction of the real-world power
grids, which implies the prospective applicability of machine learning
techniques on power-grid studies.</span>

been adequately studied yet, unlike other optimality measures such as
minimizing function value. Even in the deterministic case, the optimal method
(OGM-G, due to Kim and Fessler (2021)) has just been discovered recently. In
this work, we conduct a systematic study of the algorithmic techniques in
finding near-stationary points of convex finite-sums. Our main contributions
are several algorithmic discoveries: (1) we discover a memory-saving variant of
OGM-G based on the performance estimation problem approach (Drori and Teboulle,
2014); (2) we design a new accelerated SVRG variant that can simultaneously
achieve fast rates for both minimizing gradient norm and function value; (3) we
propose an adaptively regularized accelerated SVRG variant, which does not
require the knowledge of some unknown initial constants and achieves
near-optimal complexities. We put an emphasis on the simplicity and
practicality of the new schemes, which could facilitate future developments.</span>

imperceptible perturbation. Adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted
with a malicious purpose, can lead to erroneous predictions, resulting in
catastrophic accidents. To mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks, we
propose a novel purification model called CAP-GAN. CAP-GAN takes account of the
idea of pixel-level and feature-level consistency to achieve reasonable
purification under cycle-consistent learning. Specifically, we utilize the
guided attention module and knowledge distillation to convey meaningful
information to the purification model. Once a model is fully trained, inputs
would be projected into the purification model and transformed into clean-like
images. We vary the capacity of the adversary to argue the robustness against
various types of attack strategies. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, CAP-GAN
outperforms other pre-processing based defenses under both black-box and
white-box settings.</span>

                                        <span>The central challenge in automated synthesis planning is to be able to
generate and predict outcomes of a diverse set of chemical reactions. In
particular, in many cases, the most likely synthesis pathway cannot be applied
due to additional constraints, which requires proposing alternative chemical
reactions. With this in mind, we present Molecule Edit Graph Attention Network
(MEGAN), an end-to-end encoder-decoder neural model. MEGAN is inspired by
models that express a chemical reaction as a sequence of graph edits, akin to
the arrow pushing formalism. We extend this model to retrosynthesis prediction
(predicting substrates given the product of a chemical reaction) and scale it
up to large datasets. We argue that representing the reaction as a sequence of
edits enables MEGAN to efficiently explore the space of plausible chemical
reactions, maintaining the flexibility of modeling the reaction in an
end-to-end fashion, and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in standard
benchmarks. Code and trained models are made available online at

                                        <span>This paper shows that decision trees constructed with Classification and
Regression Trees (CART) methodology are universally consistent in an additive
model context, even when the number of predictor variables scales exponentially
with the sample size, under certain $1$-norm sparsity constraints. The
consistency is universal in the sense that there are no a priori assumptions on
the distribution of the predictor variables. Amazingly, this adaptivity to
(approximate or exact) sparsity is achieved with a single tree, as opposed to
what might be expected for an ensemble. Finally, we show that these qualitative
properties of individual trees are inherited by Breiman&#x27;s random forests.
Another surprise is that consistency holds even when the &quot;mtry&quot; tuning
parameter vanishes as a fraction of the number of predictor variables, thus
speeding up computation of the forest. A key step in the analysis is the
establishment of an oracle inequality, which precisely characterizes the
goodness-of-fit and complexity tradeoff for a misspecified model.</span>

                                        <span>The gloabal objective of inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is to estimate
the unknown cost function of some MDP base on observed trajectories generated
by (approximate) optimal policies. The classical approach consists in tuning
this cost function so that associated optimal trajectories (that minimise the
cumulative discounted cost, i.e. the classical RL loss) are &#x27;similar&#x27; to the
observed ones. Prior contributions focused on penalising degenerate solutions
and improving algorithmic scalability. Quite orthogonally to them, we question
the pertinence of characterising optimality with respect to the cumulative
discounted cost as it induces an implicit bias against policies with longer
mixing times. State of the art value based RL algorithms circumvent this issue
by solving for the fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator, a stronger
criterion that is not well defined for the inverse problem. To alleviate this
bias in IRL, we introduce an alternative training loss that puts more weights
on future states which yields a reformulation of the (maximum entropy) IRL
problem. The algorithms we devised exhibit enhanced performances (and similar
tractability) than off-the-shelf ones in multiple OpenAI gym environments.</span>

most widely used clustering methods. However, HAC is notoriously hard to scale
to large data sets as the underlying complexity is at least quadratic in the
number of data points and many algorithms to solve HAC are inherently
sequential. In this paper, we propose {Reciprocal Agglomerative Clustering
(RAC)}, a distributed algorithm for HAC, that uses a novel strategy to
efficiently merge clusters in parallel. We prove theoretically that RAC
recovers the exact solution of HAC. Furthermore, under clusterability and
balancedness assumption we show provable speedups in total runtime due to the
parallelism. We also show that these speedups are achievable for certain
probabilistic data models. In extensive experiments, we show that this
parallelism is achieved on real world data sets and that the proposed RAC
algorithm can recover the HAC hierarchy on billions of data points connected by
trillions of edges in less than an hour.</span>

                                        <span>The automated analysis of medical images is currently limited by technical
and biological noise and bias. The same source tissue can be represented by
vastly different images if the image acquisition or processing protocols vary.
For an image analysis pipeline, it is crucial to compensate such biases to
avoid misinterpretations. Here, we evaluate, compare, and improve existing
generative model architectures to overcome domain shifts for immunofluorescence
(IF) and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained microscopy images. To determine
the performance of the generative models, the original and transformed images
were segmented or classified by deep neural networks that were trained only on
images of the target bias. In the scope of our analysis, U-Net cycleGANs
trained with an additional identity and an MS-SSIM-based loss and Fixed-Point
GANs trained with an additional structure loss led to the best results for the
IF and H&amp;E stained samples, respectively. Adapting the bias of the samples
significantly improved the pixel-level segmentation for human kidney glomeruli
and podocytes and improved the classification accuracy for human prostate
biopsies by up to 14%.</span>

it approximates real-world conditions, in that we do not always know all the
properties of a given system, up to knowing almost nothing but the results.
This paper describes our approach to solving the black-box optimization
challenge at NeurIPS 2020 through learning search space partition for local
Bayesian optimization. We describe the task of the challenge as well as our
algorithm for low budget optimization that we named \texttt{SPBOpt}. We
optimize the hyper-parameters of our algorithm for the competition finals using
multi-task Bayesian optimization on results from the first two evaluation

learning. So far, however, it is largely unclear why the learned
representations generalize so effectively to a large variety of downstream
tasks. We here prove that feedforward models trained with objectives belonging
to the commonly used InfoNCE family learn to implicitly invert the underlying
generative model of the observed data. While the proofs make certain
statistical assumptions about the generative model, we observe empirically that
our findings hold even if these assumptions are severely violated. Our theory
highlights a fundamental connection between contrastive learning, generative
modeling, and nonlinear independent component analysis, thereby furthering our
understanding of the learned representations as well as providing a theoretical
foundation to derive more effective contrastive losses.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a robust linear regression model $y&#x3D;X\beta^* + \eta$, where an
adversary oblivious to the design $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ may choose
$\eta$ to corrupt all but an $\alpha$ fraction of the observations $y$ in an
arbitrary way. Prior to our work, even for Gaussian $X$, no estimator for
$\beta^*$ was known to be consistent in this model except for quadratic sample
size $n \gtrsim (d/\alpha)^2$ or for logarithmic inlier fraction $\alpha\ge
1/\log n$. We show that consistent estimation is possible with nearly linear
sample size and inverse-polynomial inlier fraction. Concretely, we show that
the Huber loss estimator is consistent for every sample size $n&#x3D;
\omega(d/\alpha^2)$ and achieves an error rate of $O(d/\alpha^2n)^{1/2}$. Both
bounds are optimal (up to constant factors). Our results extend to designs far
beyond the Gaussian case and only require the column span of $X$ to not contain
approximately sparse vectors). (similar to the kind of assumption commonly made
about the kernel space for compressed sensing). We provide two technically
similar proofs. One proof is phrased in terms of strong convexity, extending
work of [Tsakonas et al.&#x27;14], and particularly short. The other proof
highlights a connection between the Huber loss estimator and high-dimensional
median computations. In the special case of Gaussian designs, this connection
leads us to a strikingly simple algorithm based on computing coordinate-wise
medians that achieves optimal guarantees in nearly-linear time, and that can
exploit sparsity of $\beta^*$. The model studied here also captures
heavy-tailed noise distributions that may not even have a first moment.</span>

                                        <span>Existing topic modeling and text segmentation methodologies generally require
large datasets for training, limiting their capabilities when only small
collections of text are available. In this work, we reexamine the inter-related
problems of &quot;topic identification&quot; and &quot;text segmentation&quot; for sparse document
learning, when there is a single new text of interest. In developing a
methodology to handle single documents, we face two major challenges. First is
sparse information: with access to only one document, we cannot train
traditional topic models or deep learning algorithms. Second is significant
noise: a considerable portion of words in any single document will produce only
noise and not help discern topics or segments. To tackle these issues, we
design an unsupervised, computationally efficient methodology called BATS:
Biclustering Approach to Topic modeling and Segmentation. BATS leverages three
key ideas to simultaneously identify topics and segment text: (i) a new
mechanism that uses word order information to reduce sample complexity, (ii) a
statistically sound graph-based biclustering technique that identifies latent
structures of words and sentences, and (iii) a collection of effective
heuristics that remove noise words and award important words to further improve
performance. Experiments on four datasets show that our approach outperforms
several state-of-the-art baselines when considering topic coherence, topic
diversity, segmentation, and runtime comparison metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Networks (NNs) can provide major empirical performance improvements
for robotic systems, but they also introduce challenges in formally analyzing
those systems&#x27; safety properties. In particular, this work focuses on
estimating the forward reachable set of closed-loop systems with NN
controllers. Recent work provides bounds on these reachable sets, yet the
computationally efficient approaches provide overly conservative bounds (thus
cannot be used to verify useful properties), whereas tighter methods are too
intensive for online computation. This work bridges the gap by formulating a
convex optimization problem for reachability analysis for closed-loop systems
with NN controllers. While the solutions are less tight than prior semidefinite
program-based methods, they are substantially faster to compute, and some of
the available computation time can be used to refine the bounds through input
set partitioning, which more than overcomes the tightness gap. The proposed
framework further considers systems with measurement and process noise, thus
being applicable to realistic systems with uncertainty. Finally, numerical
comparisons show $10\times$ reduction in conservatism in $\frac{1}{2}$ of the
computation time compared to the state-of-the-art, and the ability to handle
various sources of uncertainty is highlighted on a quadrotor model.</span>

algorithms in the context of continuous-control, when the underlying reward
function of the demonstrating expert cannot be observed at any time. The vast
literature in imitation learning mostly considers this reward function to be
available for HP selection, but this is not a realistic setting. Indeed, would
this reward function be available, it could then directly be used for policy
training and imitation would not be necessary. To tackle this mostly ignored
problem, we propose a number of possible proxies to the external reward. We
evaluate them in an extensive empirical study (more than 10&#x27;000 agents across 9
environments) and make practical recommendations for selecting HPs. Our results
show that while imitation learning algorithms are sensitive to HP choices, it
is often possible to select good enough HPs through a proxy to the reward
function.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, multi-view learning technologies for various applications
have attracted a surge of interest. Due to more compatible and complementary
information from multiple views, existing multi-view methods could achieve more
promising performance than conventional single-view methods in most situations.
However, there are still no sufficient researches on the unified framework in
existing multi-view works. Meanwhile, how to efficiently integrate multi-view
information is still full of challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel
multi-view learning framework, which aims to leverage most existing graph
embedding works into a unified formula via introducing the graph consensus
term. In particular, our method explores the graph structure in each view
independently to preserve the diversity property of graph embedding methods.
Meanwhile, we choose heterogeneous graphs to construct the graph consensus term
to explore the correlations among multiple views jointly. To this end, the
diversity and complementary information among different views could be
simultaneously considered. Furthermore, the proposed framework is utilized to
implement the multi-view extension of Locality Linear Embedding, named
Multi-view Locality Linear Embedding (MvLLE), which could be efficiently solved
by applying the alternating optimization strategy. Empirical validations
conducted on six benchmark datasets can show the effectiveness of our proposed
method.</span>

minimizing the aggregation error under the channel alignment constraint. We

                                        <span>Logistic regression remains one of the most widely used tools in applied
statistics, machine learning and data science. However, in moderately
high-dimensional problems, where the number of features $d$ is a non-negligible
fraction of the sample size $n$, the logistic regression maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE), and statistical procedures based the large-sample
approximation of its distribution, behave poorly. Recently, Sur and Cand\&#x60;es
(2019) showed that these issues can be corrected by applying a new
approximation of the MLE&#x27;s sampling distribution in this high-dimensional
regime. Unfortunately, these corrections are difficult to implement in
practice, because they require an estimate of the \emph{signal strength}, which
is a function of the underlying parameters $\beta$ of the logistic regression.
To address this issue, we propose SLOE, a fast and straightforward approach to
estimate the signal strength in logistic regression. The key insight of SLOE is
that the Sur and Cand\&#x60;es (2019) correction can be reparameterized in terms of
the \emph{corrupted signal strength}, which is only a function of the estimated
parameters $\widehat \beta$. We propose an estimator for this quantity, prove
that it is consistent in the relevant high-dimensional regime, and show that
dimensionality correction using SLOE is accurate in finite samples. Compared to
the existing ProbeFrontier heuristic, SLOE is conceptually simpler and orders
of magnitude faster, making it suitable for routine use. We demonstrate the
importance of routine dimensionality correction in the Heart Disease dataset
from the UCI repository, and a genomics application using data from the UK
Biobank. We provide an open source package for this method, available at

                                        <span>To develop and train defect prediction models, researchers rely on datasets
in which a defect is attributed to an artifact, e.g., a class of a given
release. However, the creation of such datasets is far from being perfect. It
can happen that a defect is discovered several releases after its introduction:
this phenomenon has been called &quot;dormant defects&quot;. This means that, if we
observe today the status of a class in its current version, it can be
considered as defect-free while this is not the case. We call &quot;snoring&quot; the
noise consisting of such classes, affected by dormant defects only. We
conjecture that the presence of snoring negatively impacts the classifiers&#x27;
accuracy and their evaluation. Moreover, earlier releases likely contain more
snoring classes than older releases, thus, removing the most recent releases
from a dataset could reduce the snoring effect and improve the accuracy of
classifiers. In this paper we investigate the impact of the snoring noise on
classifiers&#x27; accuracy and their evaluation, and the effectiveness of a possible
countermeasure consisting in removing the last releases of data. We analyze the
accuracy of 15 machine learning defect prediction classifiers on data from more
than 4,000 bugs and 600 releases of 19 open source projects from the Apache
ecosystem. Our results show that, on average across projects: (i) the presence
of snoring decreases the recall of defect prediction classifiers; (ii)
evaluations affected by snoring are likely unable to identify the best
classifiers, and (iii) removing data from recent releases helps to
significantly improve the accuracy of the classifiers. On summary, this paper
provides insights on how to create a software defect dataset by mitigating the
effect of snoring.</span>

applications. However, the large storage overheads and the substantial
computation cost of CNNs are problematic in hardware accelerators.
Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has demonstrated great potential to
effectively compute large-scale matrix-vector multiplication. However, the
intensive multiply and accumulation (MAC) operations executed at the crossbar
array and the limited capacity of CIM macros remain bottlenecks for further
improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. To reduce computation costs,
network pruning and quantization are two widely studied compression methods to
shrink the model size. However, most of the model compression algorithms can
only be implemented in digital-based CNN accelerators. For implementation in a
static random access memory (SRAM) CIM-based accelerator, the model compression
algorithm must consider the hardware limitations of CIM macros, such as the
number of word lines and bit lines that can be turned on at the same time, as
well as how to map the weight to the SRAM CIM macro. In this study, a software
and hardware co-design approach is proposed to design an SRAM CIM-based CNN
accelerator and an SRAM CIM-aware model compression algorithm. To lessen the
high-precision MAC required by batch normalization (BN), a quantization
algorithm that can fuse BN into the weights is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce
the number of network parameters, a sparsity algorithm that considers a CIM
architecture is proposed. Last, MARS, a CIM-based CNN accelerator that can
utilize multiple SRAM CIM macros as processing units and support a sparsity
neural network, is proposed.</span>

tasks, one issue remains: The current strategies rely heavily on a huge amount
of labeled data. In many real-world problems, it is not feasible to create such
an amount of labeled training data. Therefore, it is common to incorporate
unlabeled data into the training process to reach equal results with fewer
labels. Due to a lot of concurrent research, it is difficult to keep track of
recent developments. In this survey, we provide an overview of often used ideas
and methods in image classification with fewer labels. We compare 34 methods in
detail based on their performance and their commonly used ideas rather than a
fine-grained taxonomy. In our analysis, we identify three major trends that
lead to future research opportunities. 1. State-of-the-art methods are
scaleable to real-world applications in theory but issues like class imbalance,
robustness, or fuzzy labels are not considered. 2. The degree of supervision
which is needed to achieve comparable results to the usage of all labels is
decreasing and therefore methods need to be extended to settings with a
variable number of classes. 3. All methods share some common ideas but we
identify clusters of methods that do not share many ideas. We show that
combining ideas from different clusters can lead to better performance.</span>

$X_{t+1} &#x3D; \phi(A^* X_t) + \eta_t$, where $\eta_t$ is unbiased noise and $\phi
: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a known link function that satisfies certain
{\em expansivity property}. The goal is to learn $A^*$ from a single trajectory
$X_1,\cdots,X_T$ of {\em dependent or correlated} samples. While the problem is
well-studied in the linear case, where $\phi$ is identity, with optimal error
rates even for non-mixing systems, existing results in the non-linear case hold
only for mixing systems. In this work, we improve existing results for learning
nonlinear systems in a number of ways: a) we provide the first offline
algorithm that can learn non-linear dynamical systems without the mixing
assumption, b) we significantly improve upon the sample complexity of existing
results for mixing systems, c) in the much harder one-pass, streaming setting
we study a SGD with Reverse Experience Replay ($\mathsf{SGD-RER}$) method, and
demonstrate that for mixing systems, it achieves the same sample complexity as
our offline algorithm, d) we justify the expansivity assumption by showing that
for the popular ReLU link function -- a non-expansive but easy to learn link
function with i.i.d. samples -- any method would require exponentially many
samples (with respect to dimension of $X_t$) from the dynamical system. We
validate our results via. simulations and demonstrate that a naive application
of SGD can be highly sub-optimal. Indeed, our work demonstrates that for
correlated data, specialized methods designed for the dependency structure in

for completing various tasks. Many few-shot models have been widely used for
relation learning tasks. However, each of these models has a shortage of
capturing a certain aspect of semantic features, for example, CNN on long-range
dependencies part, Transformer on local features. It is difficult for a single
model to adapt to various relation learning, which results in the high variance
problem. Ensemble strategy could be competitive on improving the accuracy of
few-shot relation extraction and mitigating high variance risks. This paper
explores an ensemble approach to reduce the variance and introduces fine-tuning

ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable.
These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of
paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of
energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in
centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To
overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated
learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at
solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the
similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design
federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model,
and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training
convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our
federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets
generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart
building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods
in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall

data while reasoning about the epistemic uncertainty -- a key element towards
enabling active causal discovery and designing interventions in real world
systems. In this work, we propose a general, fully differentiable framework for
Bayesian structure learning (DiBS) that operates in the continuous space of a
latent probabilistic graph representation. Building on recent advances in
variational inference, we use DiBS to devise an efficient method for
approximating posteriors over structural models. Contrary to existing work,
DiBS is agnostic to the form of the local conditional distributions and allows
for joint posterior inference of both the graph structure and the conditional
distribution parameters. This makes our method directly applicable to posterior
inference of nonstandard Bayesian network models, e.g., with nonlinear
dependencies encoded by neural networks. In evaluations on simulated and
real-world data, DiBS significantly outperforms related approaches to joint
posterior inference.</span>

analysis of lung involvement in COVID- 19 infections. Obtaining voxel-level
annotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive.
Therefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense
regression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation
approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated
from high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs
provide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object
segmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network
to compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local
details. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe
lesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information
regarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification
approach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense
conditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The
refined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation
network. When evaluated on 69 CT scans, our method substantially improves the
intersection over union from 0.335 in the CAM-based weakly supervised
segmentation method to 0.495.</span>

(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into

arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has

gatekeepers must make justified and fair real-time decisions about a person&#x27;s
fitness for a particular opportunity. In this paper, we aim to accomplish
approximate group fairness in an online stochastic decision-making process,
where the fairness metric we consider is equalized odds. Our work follows from
the classical learning-from-experts scheme, assuming a finite set of
classifiers (human experts, rules, options, etc) that cannot be modified. We
run separate instances of the algorithm for each label class as well as
sensitive groups, where the probability of choosing each instance is optimized
for both fairness and regret. Our theoretical results show that approximately
equalized odds can be achieved without sacrificing much regret. We also
demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on real data sets commonly used by
the fairness community.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-party learning provides solutions for training joint models with
decentralized data under legal and practical constraints. However, traditional
multi-party learning approaches are confronted with obstacles such as system
heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and incentive design. How to deal
with these challenges and further improve the efficiency and performance of
multi-party learning has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper,
we propose a novel contrastive multi-party learning framework for knowledge
refinement and sharing with an accountable incentive mechanism. Since the
existing naive model parameter averaging method is contradictory to the
learning paradigm of neural networks, we simulate the process of human
cognition and communication, and analogy multi-party learning as a many-to-one
knowledge sharing problem. The approach is capable of integrating the acquired
explicit knowledge of each client in a transparent manner without privacy
disclosure, and it reduces the dependence on data distribution and
communication environments. The proposed scheme achieves significant
improvement in model performance in a variety of scenarios, as we demonstrated
through experiments on several real-world datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning is gaining increasing popularity for spatiotemporal
forecasting. However, prior works have mostly focused on point estimates
without quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. In high stakes domains,
being able to generate probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals is
critical to risk assessment and decision making. Hence, a systematic study of
uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for spatiotemporal forecasting is
missing in the community. In this paper, we describe two types of
spatiotemporal forecasting problems: regular grid-based and graph-based. Then
we analyze UQ methods from both the Bayesian and the frequentist point of view,
casting in a unified framework via statistical decision theory. Through
extensive experiments on real-world road network traffic, epidemics, and air
quality forecasting tasks, we reveal the statistical and computational
trade-offs for different UQ methods: Bayesian methods are typically more robust
in mean prediction, while confidence levels obtained from frequentist methods
provide more extensive coverage over data variations. Computationally, quantile
regression type methods are cheaper for a single confidence interval but
require re-training for different intervals. Sampling based methods generate
samples that can form multiple confidence intervals, albeit at a higher
computational cost.</span>

                                        <span>The performance of speaker recognition system is highly dependent on the
amount of speech used in enrollment and test. This work presents a detailed
experimental review and analysis of the GMM-SVM based speaker recognition
system in presence of duration variability. This article also reports a
comparison of the performance of GMM-SVM classifier with its precursor
technique Gaussian mixture model-universal background model (GMM-UBM)
classifier in presence of duration variability. The goal of this research work
is not to propose a new algorithm for improving speaker recognition performance
in presence of duration variability. However, the main focus of this work is on
utterance partitioning (UP), a commonly used strategy to compensate the
duration variability issue. We have analysed in detailed the impact of training
utterance partitioning in speaker recognition performance under GMM-SVM
framework. We further investigate the reason why the utterance partitioning is
important for boosting speaker recognition performance. We have also shown in
which case the utterance partitioning could be useful and where not. Our study
has revealed that utterance partitioning does not reduce the data imbalance
problem of the GMM-SVM classifier as claimed in earlier study. Apart from
these, we also discuss issues related to the impact of parameters such as
number of Gaussians, supervector length, amount of splitting required for
obtaining better performance in short and long duration test conditions from
speech duration perspective. We have performed the experiments with telephone
speech from POLYCOST corpus consisting of 130 speakers.</span>

                                        <span>Recent grid-based document representations like BERTgrid allow the
simultaneous encoding of the textual and layout information of a document in a
2D feature map so that state-of-the-art image segmentation and/or object
detection models can be straightforwardly leveraged to extract key information
from documents. However, such methods have not achieved comparable performance
to state-of-the-art sequence- and graph-based methods such as LayoutLM and PICK
yet. In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal backbone network by
concatenating a BERTgrid to an intermediate layer of a CNN model, where the
input of CNN is a document image and the BERTgrid is a grid of word embeddings,
to generate a more powerful grid-based document representation, named
ViBERTgrid. Unlike BERTgrid, the parameters of BERT and CNN in our multimodal
backbone network are trained jointly. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this joint training strategy improves significantly the representation ability
of ViBERTgrid. Consequently, our ViBERTgrid-based key information extraction
approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.</span>

convex quadratic programs that exploits the rank-dominating eigenvectors of the
quadratic matrix. Each level of approximation admits a min-max characterization
whose objective function can be optimized over the binary variables
analytically, while preserving convexity in the continuous variables.
Exploiting this property, we propose two scalable optimization algorithms,

                                        <span>Unobserved confounding is one of the greatest challenges for causal
discovery. The case in which unobserved variables have a widespread effect on
many of the observed ones is particularly difficult because most pairs of
variables are conditionally dependent given any other subset, rendering the
causal effect unidentifiable. In this paper we show that beyond conditional
independencies, under the principle of independent mechanisms, unobserved
confounding in this setting leaves a statistical footprint in the observed data
distribution that allows for disentangling spurious and causal effects. Using
this insight, we demonstrate that a sparse linear Gaussian directed acyclic
graph among observed variables may be recovered approximately and propose an
adjusted score-based causal discovery algorithm that may be implemented with
general purpose solvers and scales to high-dimensional problems. We find, in
addition, that despite the conditions we pose to guarantee causal recovery,
performance in practice is robust to large deviations in model assumptions.</span>

                                        <span>We study several simplified dark matter (DM) models and their signatures at
the LHC using neural networks. We focus on the usual monojet plus missing
transverse energy channel, but to train the algorithms we organize the data in
2D histograms instead of event-by-event arrays. This results in a large
performance boost to distinguish between standard model (SM) only and SM plus
new physics signals. We use the kinematic monojet features as input data which
allow us to describe families of models with a single data sample. We found
that the neural network performance does not depend on the simulated number of
background events if they are presented as a function of $S/\sqrt{B}$, where
$S$ and $B$ are the number of signal and background events per histogram,
respectively. This provides flexibility to the method, since testing a
particular model in that case only requires knowing the new physics monojet
cross section. Furthermore, we also discuss the network performance under
incorrect assumptions about the true DM nature. Finally, we propose multimodel
classifiers to search and identify new signals in a more general way, for the
next LHC run.</span>

                                        <span>Internet of Things (IoT) allowed smart homes to improve the quality and the
comfort of our daily lives. However, these conveniences introduced several
security concerns that increase rapidly. IoT devices, smart home hubs, and
gateway raise various security risks. The smart home gateways act as a
centralized point of communication between the IoT devices, which can create a
backdoor into network data for hackers. One of the common and effective ways to
detect such attacks is intrusion detection in the network traffic. In this
paper, we proposed an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect anomalies in a
smart home network using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and
convolutional neural network (CNN) hybrid model. The BiLSTM recurrent behavior
provides the intrusion detection model to preserve the learned information
through time, and the CNN extracts perfectly the data features. The proposed
model can be applied to any smart home network gateway.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning algorithms, when trained on audio recordings from a limited
set of devices, may not generalize well to samples recorded using other devices
with different frequency responses. In this work, a relatively straightforward
method is introduced to address this problem. Two variants of the approach are
presented. First requires aligned examples from multiple devices, the second
approach alleviates this requirement. This method works for both time and
frequency domain representations of audio recordings. Further, a relation to
standardization and Cepstral Mean Subtraction is analysed. The proposed
approach becomes effective even when very few examples are provided. This
method was developed during the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes
and Events (DCASE) 2019 challenge and won the 1st place in the scenario with
mis-matched recording devices with the accuracy of 75%. Source code for the
experiments can be found online.</span>

critical decisions, and variable importance is one of the main interpretation
tools. Shapley effects are now widely used to interpret both tree ensembles and
neural networks, as they can efficiently handle dependence and interactions in
the data, as opposed to most other variable importance measures. However,
estimating Shapley effects is a challenging task, because of the computational
complexity and the conditional expectation estimates. Accordingly, existing
Shapley algorithms have flaws: a costly running time, or a bias when input
variables are dependent. Therefore, we introduce SHAFF, SHApley eFfects via
random Forests, a fast and accurate Shapley effect estimate, even when input
variables are dependent. We show SHAFF efficiency through both a theoretical
analysis of its consistency, and the practical performance improvements over
competitors with extensive experiments. An implementation of SHAFF in C++ and R

automatic music tagging. The problem can be approached by using either
engineered time-frequency features or raw audio as input. Modulation filter
bank representations that have been actively researched as a basis for timbre
perception have the potential to facilitate the extraction of perceptually
salient features. We explore end-to-end learned front-ends for audio
representation learning, ModNet and SincModNet, that incorporate a temporal
modulation processing block. The structure is effectively analogous to a
modulation filter bank, where the FIR filter center frequencies are learned in
a data-driven manner. The expectation is that a perceptually motivated filter
bank can provide a useful representation for identifying music features. Our
experimental results provide a fully visualisable and interpretable front-end
temporal modulation decomposition of raw audio. We evaluate the performance of
our model against the state-of-the-art of music tagging on the MagnaTagATune
dataset. We analyse the impact on performance for particular tags when
time-frequency bands are subsampled by the modulation filters at a
progressively reduced rate. We demonstrate that modulation filtering provides
promising results for music tagging and feature representation, without using
extensive musical domain knowledge in the design of this front-end.</span>

from the perspective of inverse reinforcement learning. As rational agents,
drivers are trying to maximize some reward function unknown to an external
observer as they make up their trajectories. We apply the concept of random
utility from microeconomic theory to model the unknown reward function as a
function of observable features plus an error term which represents features
known only to the driver. We develop a parameterized generative model for the
trajectories based on a random utility Markov decision process formulation of
drivers decisions. We show that maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning
is a particular case of our proposed formulation when we assume a Gumbel
density function for the unobserved reward error terms. We illustrate Bayesian
inference on model parameters through a case study with real trajectory data
from a large city obtained from sensors placed on sparsely distributed points

                                        <span>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that an over-parametrized network
consists of &quot;lottery tickets&quot;, and training a certain collection of them (i.e.,
a subnetwork) can match the performance of the full model. In this paper, we
study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as &quot;winning tickets&quot;,
in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language models. We
observe that at certain compression ratios, generalization performance of the
winning tickets can not only match, but also exceed that of the full model. In
particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the compression ratio
increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets first improves
then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the tickets on the
threshold as &quot;super tickets&quot;. We further show that the phase transition is task
and model dependent -- as model size becomes larger and training data set
becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced. Our experiments on the
GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve single task fine-tuning by
$0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on BERT-large, in terms of
task-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively sharing the super
tickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.</span>

                                        <span>Cluster algorithms are increasingly popular in biomedical research due to
their compelling ability to identify discrete subgroups in data, and their
increasing accessibility in mainstream software. While guidelines exist for
algorithm selection and outcome evaluation, there are no firmly established
ways of computing a priori statistical power for cluster analysis. Here, we
estimated power and accuracy for common analysis pipelines through simulation.
We varied subgroup size, number, separation (effect size), and covariance
structure. We then subjected generated datasets to dimensionality reduction
(none, multidimensional scaling, or UMAP) and cluster algorithms (k-means,
agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward or average linkage and
Euclidean or cosine distance, HDBSCAN). Finally, we compared the statistical
power of discrete (k-means), &quot;fuzzy&quot; (c-means), and finite mixture modelling
approaches (which include latent profile and latent class analysis). We found
that outcomes were driven by large effect sizes or the accumulation of many
smaller effects across features, and were unaffected by differences in
covariance structure. Sufficient statistical power was achieved with relatively
small samples (N&#x3D;20 per subgroup), provided cluster separation is large
({\Delta}&#x3D;4). Fuzzy clustering provided a more parsimonious and powerful
alternative for identifying separable multivariate normal distributions,
particularly those with slightly lower centroid separation ({\Delta}&#x3D;3).
Overall, we recommend that researchers 1) only apply cluster analysis when
large subgroup separation is expected, 2) aim for sample sizes of N&#x3D;20 to N&#x3D;30
per expected subgroup, 3) use multidimensional scaling to improve cluster
separation, and 4) use fuzzy clustering or finite mixture modelling approaches
that are more powerful and more parsimonious with partially overlapping
multivariate normal distributions.</span>

                                        <span>Background The learning of genotype-phenotype associations and history of
human disease by doing detailed and precise analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities can be defined as deep phenotyping. To understand and detect this
interaction between phenotype and genotype is a fundamental step when
translating precision medicine to clinical practice. The recent advances in the
field of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between
abnormal human phenotypes and genes.

Methods In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between
human phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the
heterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human
phenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO &amp;
genes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on
this graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes
to generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream
task to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different
supervised machine learning algorithms.

Results: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR
0.784. In addition, LightGBM achieved an optimal weighted F1 score of 0.87.
Compared to the other 4 methods LightGBM is able to find more accurate
interaction/link between human phenotype &amp; gene pairs.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks offer numerous potential applications across geoscience,
for example, one could argue that they are the state-of-the-art method for
predicting faults in seismic datasets. In quantitative reservoir
characterization workflows, it is common to incorporate the uncertainty of
predictions thus such subsurface models should provide calibrated probabilities
and the associated uncertainties in their predictions. It has been shown that
popular Deep Learning-based models are often miscalibrated, and due to their
deterministic nature, provide no means to interpret the uncertainty of their
predictions. We compare three different approaches to obtaining probabilistic
models based on convolutional neural networks in a Bayesian formalism, namely
Deep Ensembles, Concrete Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian
(SWAG). These methods are consistently applied to fault detection case studies
where Deep Ensembles use independently trained models to provide fault
probabilities, Concrete Dropout represents an extension to the popular Dropout
technique to approximate Bayesian neural networks, and finally, we apply SWAG,
a recent method that is based on the Bayesian inference equivalence of
mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent. We provide quantitative results in
terms of model calibration and uncertainty representation, as well as
qualitative results on synthetic and real seismic datasets. Our results show
that the approximate Bayesian methods, Concrete Dropout and SWAG, both provide
well-calibrated predictions and uncertainty attributes at a lower computational
cost when compared to the baseline Deep Ensemble approach. The resulting
uncertainties also offer a possibility to further improve the model performance
as well as enhancing the interpretability of the models.</span>

                                        <span>Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) is an emerging modeling paradigm which
aims to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to
create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and
self-evolving models. Here, we introduce, justify and demonstrate a novel
approach to HAM -- the Corrective Source Term Approach (CoSTA) -- which
augments the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term
generated by a deep neural network (DNN). In a series of numerical experiments
on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is generally found to outperform
comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy -- often reducing predictive
errors by several orders of magnitude -- while also generalizing better than
pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides
a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM,
and due to the interpretability of the DNN-generated source term within the PBM
paradigm, CoSTA can be a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to
enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM.</span>

                                        <span>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approaches usually present special
requirements (e.g., hyperparameter validation, collection of outlier data) and
produce side effects (e.g., classification accuracy drop, slower
energy-inefficient inferences). We argue that these issues are a consequence of
the SoftMax loss anisotropy and disagreement with the maximum entropy
principle. Thus, we propose the IsoMax loss and the entropic score. The
seamless drop-in replacement of the SoftMax loss by IsoMax loss requires
neither additional data collection nor hyperparameter validation. The trained
models do not exhibit classification accuracy drop and produce fast
energy-efficient inferences. Moreover, our experiments show that training
neural networks with IsoMax loss significantly improves their OOD detection
performance. The IsoMax loss exhibits state-of-the-art performance under the
mentioned conditions (fast energy-efficient inference, no classification
accuracy drop, no collection of outlier data, and no hyperparameter
validation), which we call the seamless OOD detection task. In future work,
current OOD detection methods may replace the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss
to improve their performance on the commonly studied non-seamless OOD detection
problem.</span>

model-agnostic, robust against model mismatch, and interpretable. Assuming that
a small number of initial samples are available, we derive the optimal training
density that minimizes the generalization error of local polynomial smoothing
(LPS) with its kernel bandwidth tuned locally: We adopt the mean integrated
squared error (MISE) as a generalization criterion, and use the asymptotic
behavior of the MISE as well as thelocally optimal bandwidths (LOB) -- the
bandwidth function that minimizes MISE in the asymptotic limit. The asymptotic
expression of our objective then reveals the dependence of the MISE on the
training density, enabling analytic minimization. As a result, we obtain the
optimal training density in a closed-form. The almost model-free nature of our
approach should encode raw properties of the target problem, and thus provide a
robust and model-agnostic active learning strategy. Furthermore, the obtained
training density factorizes the influence of local function complexity, noise
leveland test density in a transparent and interpretable way. We validate our
theory in numerical simulations, and show that the proposed active learning
method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model-agnostic approaches.</span>

finding a projection subspace to increase and decrease the inter- and
intraclass variances, respectively. However, a bottleneck for subspace learning
methods often arises from the high dimensionality of datasets. In this paper, a
hierarchical approach is proposed to scale subspace learning methods, with the
goal of improving classification in large datasets by a range of 3% to 10%.
Different combinations of methods are studied. We assess the proposed method on
five publicly available large datasets, for different eigen-value based
subspace learning methods such as linear discriminant analysis, principal
component analysis, generalized discriminant analysis, and reconstruction
independent component analysis. To further examine the effect of the proposed
method on various classification methods, we fed the generated result to linear
discriminant analysis, quadratic linear analysis, k-nearest neighbor, and
random forest classifiers. The resulting classification accuracies are compared
to show the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach, reporting results of an
average of 5% increase in classification accuracy.</span>

one leaf node and each internal node is associated with all the data items

corresponds to a partition of the dataset. We develop a novel Bayesian
nonparametric method combining the nested Chinese Restaurant Process (nCRP) and
the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). Compared with other existing Bayesian

the number of vehicles on the roads leading to even more traffic and greater
traffic congestion. This paper investigates urban travel demand in Lagos and
explores passenger dynamics in time and space. Using individual commuter trip
data from tickets purchased from the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the
demand patterns through the hours of the day, days of the week and bus stations
are analysed. This study aims to quantify demand from actual passenger trips
and estimate the impact that dynamic scheduling could have on passenger waiting
times. Station segmentation is provided to cluster stations by their demand
characteristics in order to tailor specific bus schedules. Intra-day public
transportation demand in Lagos BRT is analysed and predictions are compared.
Simulations using fixed and dynamic bus scheduling demonstrate that the average
waiting time could be reduced by as much as 80%. The load curves, insights and
the approach developed will be useful for informing policymaking in Lagos and
similar African cities facing the challenges of rapid urbanization.</span>

different coordinates in the same way, a framework allowing for adaptive (non
uniform) coordinate sampling is developed to leverage structure in data. In a
non-convex setting and including zeroth order gradient estimate, almost sure
convergence as well as non-asymptotic bounds are established. Within the
proposed framework, we develop an algorithm, MUSKETEER, based on a
reinforcement strategy: after collecting information on the noisy gradients, it
samples the most promising coordinate (all for one); then it moves along the
one direction yielding an important decrease of the objective (one for all).
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data examples confirm the
effectiveness of MUSKETEER in large scale problems.</span>

equivariance in the network architecture to enhance the the network robustness
on geometry transformation of data and reduce overfitting. It has been an
intuitive and widely used technique to construct a steerable filter by
augmenting a filter with its transformed copies in the past decades, which is
named as filter transform in this paper. Recently, the problem of steerable CNN
has been studied from aspect of group representation theory, which reveals the
function space structure of a steerable kernel function. However, it is not yet
clear on how this theory is related to the filter transform technique. In this
paper, we show that kernel constructed by filter transform can also be
interpreted in the group representation theory. This interpretation help
complete the puzzle of steerable CNN theory and provides a novel and simple
approach to implement steerable convolution operators. Experiments are executed
on multiple datasets to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.</span>

                                        <span>Many recent invertible neural architectures are based on coupling block
designs where variables are divided in two subsets which serve as inputs of an
easily invertible (usually affine) triangular transformation. While such a
transformation is invertible, its Jacobian is very sparse and thus may lack
expressiveness. This work presents a simple remedy by noting that subdivision
and (affine) coupling can be repeated recursively within the resulting subsets,
leading to an efficiently invertible block with dense, triangular Jacobian. By
formulating our recursive coupling scheme via a hierarchical architecture, HINT
allows sampling from a joint distribution p(y,x) and the corresponding
posterior p(x|y) using a single invertible network. We evaluate our method on
some standard data sets and benchmark its full power for density estimation and
Bayesian inference on a novel data set of 2D shapes in Fourier
parameterization, which enables consistent visualization of samples for
different dimensionalities.</span>

                                        <span>Special-purpose Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are utilised for
benthic (seafloor) surveys, where the vehicle collects optical imagery of near
the seafloor. Due to the small-sensor footprint of the cameras and the vast
areas to be surveyed, these AUVs can not feasibly full coverage of areas larger
than a few tens of thousands of square meters. Therefore AUV paths which sample
sparsely, yet effectively, the survey areas are necessary. Broad scale acoustic
bathymetric data is ready available over large areas, and often is a useful
prior of seafloor cover. As such, prior bathymetry can be used to guide AUV
data collection. This research proposes methods for planning initial AUV
surveys that efficiently explore a feature space representation of the
bathymetry, in order to sample from a diverse set of bathymetric terrain. This
will enable the AUV to visit areas that likely contain unique habitats and are
representative of the entire survey site. The suitability of these methods to
plan AUV surveys is evaluated based on the coverage of the feature space and
also the ability to visit all classes of benthic habitat on the initial dive.
This is a valuable tool for AUV surveys as it increases the utility of initial
dives. It also delivers a comprehensive training set to learn a relationship
between acoustic bathymetry and visually-derived seafloor classifications.</span>

real-time decision making in complex environments, and require prediction of
future outcomes from limited data. Moreover, their decisions are increasingly
required to be interpretable to humans for safe and trustworthy co-existence.
This paper is a first step towards interpretable learning-based robot control.
We introduce a novel learning problem, called incremental formula and predictor
learning, to generate binary classifiers with temporal logic structure from
time-series data. The classifiers are represented as pairs of Signal Temporal
Logic (STL) formulae and predictors for their satisfaction. The incremental
property provides prediction of labels for prefix signals that are revealed
over time. We propose a boosted decision-tree algorithm that leverages weak,
but computationally inexpensive, learners to increase prediction and runtime
performance. The effectiveness and classification accuracy of our algorithms
are evaluated on autonomous-driving and naval surveillance case studies.</span>

enhancement, we propose a novel pan-sharpening convolutional neural network
based on a high-pass modification block. Different from existing methods, the
proposed block is designed to learn the high-pass information, leading to
enhance spatial information in each band of the multi-spectral-resolution
images. To facilitate the generation of visually appealing pan-sharpened

based on high-level features in the near-infrared space. Experiments

techniques can enhance Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) methods.
However, the performance of ML models is highly dependent on their training
datasets. Particularly in the semiconductor industry, given the fact that the
fabrication process of semiconductor devices is complicated and expensive, it
is of great difficulty to obtain datasets with sufficient size and good
quality. In this paper, we propose a strategy for improving ML-based device
modeling by data self-augmentation using variational autoencoder-based
techniques, where initially only a few experimental data points are required
and TCAD tools are not essential. Taking a deep neural network-based prediction
task of the Ohmic resistance value in Gallium Nitride devices as an example, we
apply our proposed strategy to augment data points and achieve a reduction in
the mean absolute error of predicting the experimental results by up to 70%.
The proposed method could be easily modified for different tasks, rendering it
of high interest to the semiconductor industry in general.</span>

                                        <span>Satellite remote sensing is playing an increasing role in the rapid mapping
of damage after natural disasters. In particular, synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) can image the Earth&#x27;s surface and map damage in all weather conditions,
day and night. However, current SAR damage mapping methods struggle to separate
damage from other changes in the Earth&#x27;s surface. In this study, we propose a
novel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time
history of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous
variations in the Earth&#x27;s surface properties due to a natural disaster. We
quantify Earth surface change using time series of Interferometric SAR
coherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly
detector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event
coherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the
coherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the
forecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence
in the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage
detection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local
behavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to
calculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time
series of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Our approach shows good agreement with
observed damage and quantitative improvement compared to using pre- to co-event
coherence loss as a damage proxy.</span>

                                        <span>4D seismic imaging has been widely used in CO$_2$ sequestration projects to
monitor the fluid flow in the volumetric subsurface region that is not sampled
by wells. Ideally, real-time monitoring and near-future forecasting would
provide site operators with great insights to understand the dynamics of the
subsurface reservoir and assess any potential risks. However, due to obstacles
such as high deployment cost, availability of acquisition equipment, exclusion
zones around surface structures, only very sparse seismic imaging data can be
obtained during monitoring. That leads to an unavoidable and growing knowledge
gap over time. The operator needs to understand the fluid flow throughout the
project lifetime and the seismic data are only available at a limited number of
times, this is insufficient for understanding the reservoir behavior. To
overcome those challenges, we have developed spatio-temporal
neural-network-based models that can produce high-fidelity interpolated or
extrapolated images effectively and efficiently. Specifically, our models are
built on an autoencoder, and incorporate the long short-term memory (LSTM)
structure with a new loss function regularized by optical flow. We validate the
performance of our models using real 4D post-stack seismic imaging data
acquired at the Sleipner CO$_2$ sequestration field. We employ two different
strategies in evaluating our models. Numerically, we compare our models with
different baseline approaches using classic pixel-based metrics. We also
conduct a blind survey and collect a total of 20 responses from domain experts
to evaluate the quality of data generated by our models. Via both numerical and
expert evaluation, we conclude that our models can produce high-quality 2D/3D
seismic imaging data at a reasonable cost, offering the possibility of
real-time monitoring or even near-future forecasting of the CO$_2$ storage
reservoir.</span>

                                        <span>Autonomous discovery and direct instruction are two extreme sources of
learning in children, but educational sciences have shown that intermediate
approaches such as assisted discovery or guided play resulted in better
acquisition of skills. When turning to Artificial Intelligence, the above
dichotomy is translated into the distinction between autonomous agents which
learn in isolation and interactive learning agents which can be taught by
social partners but generally lack autonomy. In between should stand teachable
autonomous agents: agents learning from both internal and teaching signals to
benefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery. Such agents could
learn on their own in the real world, but non-expert users could drive their
learning behavior towards their expectations. More fundamentally, combining
both capabilities might also be a key step towards general intelligence. In
this paper we elucidate obstacles along this research line. First, we build on
a seminal work of Bruner to extract relevant features of the assisted discovery
processes. Second, we describe current research on autotelic agents, i.e.
agents equipped with forms of intrinsic motivations that enable them to
represent, self-generate and pursue their own goals. We argue that autotelic
capabilities are paving the way towards teachable and autonomous agents.
Finally, we adopt a social learning perspective on tutoring interactions and we
highlight some components that are currently missing to autotelic agents before
they can be taught by ordinary people using natural pedagogy, and we provide a
list of specific research questions that emerge from this perspective.</span>

Experience. The QHAM is based on a quantum neuron design which can be utilized
for many different machine learning applications and can be implemented on real
quantum hardware without requiring mid-circuit measurement or reset operations.
We analyze the accuracy of the neuron and the full QHAM considering hardware
errors via simulation with hardware noise models as well as with implementation
on the 15-qubit ibmq_16_melbourne device. The quantum neuron and the QHAM are
shown to be resilient to noise and require low qubit and time overhead. We
benchmark the QHAM by testing its effective memory capacity against qubit- and
circuit-level errors and demonstrate its capabilities in the NISQ-era of
quantum hardware. This demonstration of the first functional QHAM to be

biomedical imaging, albeit its design and implementation have potential flaws.
Fundamentally, most deep learning models are driven entirely by data without
consideration of any prior knowledge, which dramatically increases the
complexity of neural networks and limits the application scope and model
generalizability. Here we establish a geometry-informed deep learning framework
for ultra-sparse 3D tomographic image reconstruction. We introduce a novel
mechanism for integrating geometric priors of the imaging system. We
demonstrate that the seamless inclusion of known priors is essential to enhance

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural architecture search (NAS) generally
guarantees better convergence yet suffers from the requirement of huge
computational resources compared with gradient-based approaches, due to the
rollout bottleneck -- exhaustive training for each sampled generation on proxy
tasks. In this paper, we propose a general pipeline to accelerate the
convergence of the rollout process as well as the RL process in NAS. It is
motivated by the interesting observation that both the architecture and the
parameter knowledge can be transferred between different experiments and even
different tasks. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware critic (value
function) in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to utilize the architecture
knowledge in previous experiments, which stabilizes the training process and
reduces the searching time by 4 times. Further, an architecture knowledge pool
together with a block similarity function is proposed to utilize parameter
knowledge and reduces the searching time by 2 times. It is the first to
introduce block-level weight sharing in RLbased NAS. The block similarity
function guarantees a 100% hitting ratio with strict fairness. Besides, we show
that a simply designed off-policy correction factor used in &quot;replay buffer&quot; in
RL optimization can further reduce half of the searching time. Experiments on
the Mobile Neural Architecture Search (MNAS) search space show the proposed
Fast Neural Architecture Search (FNAS) accelerates standard RL-based NAS
process by ~10x (e.g. ~256 2x2 TPUv2 x days / 20,000 GPU x hour -&gt; 2,000 GPU x
hour for MNAS), and guarantees better performance on various vision tasks.</span>

opening the road for development of AI systems in order to preserve, search,
and deliver cultural heritage. To organize such cultural content also means to
classify them, a task that is very familiar to modern computer science.
Contextual information is often the key to structure such real world data, and
we propose to use it in form of a knowledge graph. Such a knowledge graph,
combined with content analysis, enhances the notion of proximity between
artworks so it improves the performances in classification tasks. In this
paper, we propose a novel use of a knowledge graph, that is constructed on
annotated data and pseudo-labeled data. With label propagation, we boost
artwork classification by training a model using a graph convolutional network,
relying on the relationships between entities of the knowledge graph. Following
a transductive learning framework, our experiments show that relying on a
knowledge graph modeling the relations between labeled data and unlabeled data
allows to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple classification tasks on
a dataset of paintings, and on a dataset of Buddha statues. Additionally, we
show state-of-the-art results for the difficult case of dealing with unbalanced
data, with the limitation of disregarding classes with extremely low degrees in

                                        <span>Motivated by the needs from an airline crew scheduling application, we
introduce structured convolutional kernel networks (Struct-CKN), which combine
CKNs from Mairal et al. (2014) in a structured prediction framework that
supports constraints on the outputs. CKNs are a particular kind of
convolutional neural networks that approximate a kernel feature map on training
data, thus combining properties of deep learning with the non-parametric
flexibility of kernel methods. Extending CKNs to structured outputs allows us
to obtain useful initial solutions on a flight-connection dataset that can be
further refined by an airline crew scheduling solver. More specifically, we use
a flight-based network modeled as a general conditional random field capable of
incorporating local constraints in the learning process. Our experiments
demonstrate that this approach yields significant improvements for the
large-scale crew pairing problem (50,000 flights per month) over standard
approaches, reducing the solution cost by 17% (a gain of millions of dollars)
and the cost of global constraints by 97%.</span>

training data and test data are drawn from the same distributions. However, the
assumption is often violated in real world due to the sample selection bias
between the training and test data. Previous research works focus on reweighing
biased training data to match the test data and then building classification
models on the reweighed training data. However, how to achieve fairness in the
built classification models is under-explored. In this paper, we propose a
framework for robust and fair learning under sample selection bias. Our
framework adopts the reweighing estimation approach for bias correction and the
minimax robust estimation approach for achieving robustness on prediction
accuracy. Moreover, during the minimax optimization, the fairness is achieved
under the worst case, which guarantees the model&#x27;s fairness on test data. We
further develop two algorithms to handle sample selection bias when test data
is both available and unavailable. We conduct experiments on two real-world
datasets and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of
both utility and fairness metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Error-bounded lossy compression is becoming an indispensable technique for
the success of today&#x27;s scientific projects with vast volumes of data produced
during the simulations or instrument data acquisitions. Not only can it
significantly reduce data size, but it also can control the compression errors
based on user-specified error bounds. Autoencoder (AE) models have been widely
used in image compression, but few AE-based compression approaches support
error-bounding features, which are highly required by scientific applications.
To address this issue, we explore using convolutional autoencoders to improve
error-bounded lossy compression for scientific data, with the following three
key contributions. (1) We provide an in-depth investigation of the
characteristics of various autoencoder models and develop an error-bounded
autoencoder-based framework in terms of the SZ model. (2) We optimize the
compression quality for main stages in our designed AE-based error-bounded
compression framework, fine-tuning the block sizes and latent sizes and also
optimizing the compression efficiency of latent vectors. (3) We evaluate our
proposed solution using five real-world scientific datasets and comparing them
with six other related works. Experiments show that our solution exhibits a
very competitive compression quality from among all the compressors in our
tests. In absolute terms, it can obtain a much better compression quality (100%
~ 800% improvement in compression ratio with the same data distortion) compared
with SZ2.1 and ZFP in cases with a high compression ratio.</span>

                                        <span>Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles have the potential to reduce
fuel consumption and travel time in real-world driving conditions. The
eco-driving problem seeks to design optimal speed and power usage profiles
based upon look-ahead information from connectivity and advanced mapping
features. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to the
eco-driving problem. While the previous studies synthesize simulators and
model-free DRL to reduce online computation, this work proposes a Safe
Off-policy Model-Based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for the eco-driving
problem. The advantages over the existing literature are three-fold. First, the
combination of off-policy learning and the use of a physics-based model
improves the sample efficiency. Second, the training does not require any
extrinsic rewarding mechanism for constraint satisfaction. Third, the
feasibility of trajectory is guaranteed by using a safe set approximated by
deep generative models.

The performance of the proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline
controller representing human drivers, a previously designed model-free DRL
strategy, and the wait-and-see optimal solution. In simulation, the proposed
algorithm leads to a policy with a higher average speed and a better fuel
economy compared to the model-free agent. Compared to the baseline controller,
the learned strategy reduces the fuel consumption by more than 21\% while
keeping the average speed comparable.</span>

purely data-driven and in general does not require physics. This is the
strength of DL but also one of its key limitations when applied to science and
engineering problems in which underlying physical properties (such as
stability, conservation, and positivity) and desired accuracy need to be
achieved. DL methods in their original forms are not capable of respecting the
underlying mathematical models or achieving desired accuracy even in big-data
regimes. On the other hand, many data-driven science and engineering problems,
such as inverse problems, typically have limited experimental or observational
data, and DL would overfit the data in this case. Leveraging information
encoded in the underlying mathematical models, we argue, not only compensates
missing information in low data regimes but also provides opportunities to
equip DL methods with the underlying physics and hence obtaining higher
accuracy. This short communication introduces several model-constrained DL
approaches (including both feed-forward DNN and autoencoders) that are capable
of learning not only information hidden in the training data but also in the
underlying mathematical models to solve inverse problems. We present and
provide intuitions for our formulations for general nonlinear problems. For
linear inverse problems and linear networks, the first order optimality
conditions show that our model-constrained DL approaches can learn information
encoded in the underlying mathematical models, and thus can produce consistent

                                        <span>Sleep is restoration process of the body. The efficiency of this restoration
process is directly correlated to the amount of time spent at each sleep phase.
Hence, automatic tracking of sleep via wearable devices has attracted both the
researchers and industry. Current state-of-the-art sleep tracking solutions are
memory and processing greedy and they require cloud or mobile phone
connectivity. We propose a memory efficient sleep tracking architecture which
can work in the embedded environment without needing any cloud or mobile phone
connection. In this study, a novel architecture is proposed that consists of a
feature extraction and Artificial Neural Networks based stacking classifier.
Besides, we discussed how to tackle with sequential nature of the sleep staging
for the memory constraint environments through the proposed framework. To
verify the system, a dataset is collected from 24 different subjects for 31
nights with a wrist worn device having 3-axis accelerometer (ACC) and
photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors. Over the collected dataset, the proposed
classification architecture achieves 20\% and 14\% better F1 scores than its
competitors. Apart from the superior performance, proposed architecture is a
promising solution for resource constraint embedded systems by allocating only
4.2 kilobytes of memory (RAM).</span>

sign changes and addition operations only. The dot products are
energy-efficient as they avoid the multiplication operation entirely. Moreover,
the dot products induce the $\ell_1$-norm, thus providing robustness to
impulsive noise. First, we analytically prove that the dot products yield
symmetric, positive semi-definite generalized covariance matrices, thus
enabling principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the generalized
covariance matrices can be constructed in an Energy Efficient (EEF) manner due
to the multiplication-free property of the underlying vector products. We
present image reconstruction examples in which our EEF PCA method result in the

                                        <span>Recent achievements in end-to-end deep learning have encouraged the
exploration of tasks dealing with highly structured data with unified deep
network models. Having such models for compressing audio signals has been
challenging since it requires discrete representations that are not easy to
train with end-to-end backpropagation. In this paper, we present an end-to-end
deep learning approach that combines recurrent neural networks (RNNs) within
the training strategy of variational autoencoders (VAEs) with a binary
representation of the latent space. We apply a reparametrization trick for the
Bernoulli distribution for the discrete representations, which allows smooth
backpropagation. In addition, our approach allows the separation of the encoder
and decoder, which is necessary for compression tasks. To our best knowledge,
this is the first end-to-end learning for a single audio compression model with
RNNs, and our model achieves a Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) of 20.54.</span>

learning framework: the inductive Grover oracular quantum neural network
(IGO-QNN). The model defines a variational quantum circuit with hidden layers
of parameterized quantum neurons densely connected via entangle synapses to
encode a dynamic Grover&#x27;s search oracle that can be trained from a set of
database-hit training examples. This widens the range of problem applications
of Grover&#x27;s unstructured search algorithm to include the vast majority of
problems lacking analytic descriptions of solution verifiers, allowing for
quadratic speed-up in unstructured search for the set of search problems with
relationships between input and output spaces that are tractably underivable
deductively. This generalization of Grover&#x27;s oracularization may prove
particularly effective in deep reinforcement learning, computer vision, and,

personality types based on the MBTI (an introspective self-assessment
questionnaire that indicates different psychological preferences about how
people perceive the world and make decisions) through systematic enrichment of
text representation, based on the domain of the area, under the generation of
features based on three types of analysis: sentimental, grammatical and
aspects. The experimentation had a robust baseline of stacked models, with
premature optimization of hyperparameters through grid search, with gradual
feedback, for each of the four classifiers (dichotomies) of MBTI. The results
showed that attention to the data iteration loop focused on quality,
explanatory power and representativeness for the abstraction of more
relevant/important resources for the studied phenomenon made it possible to
improve the evaluation metrics results more quickly and less costly than
complex models such as the LSTM or state of the art ones as BERT, as well as
the importance of these results by comparisons made from various perspectives.

performance can be a computationally expensive task. Though visualization can
help practitioners relate hyperparameter settings to overall model performance,
significant manual inspection is still required to guide the hyperparameter
settings in the next batch of experiments. In response, we present a
streamlined visualization system enabling deep learning practitioners to more
efficiently explore, tune, and optimize hyperparameters in a batch of
experiments. A key idea is to directly suggest more optimal hyperparameter
values using a predictive mechanism. We then integrate this mechanism with
current visualization practices for deep learning. Moreover, an analysis on the
variance in a selected performance metric in the context of the model
hyperparameters shows the impact that certain hyperparameters have on the
performance metric. We evaluate the tool with a user study on deep learning
model builders, finding that our participants have little issue adopting the
tool and working with it as part of their workflow.</span>

function during the training that leads over-parameterized neural networks
(NNs) to good performance on real dataset. Empirically, existing works have
shown that weights of NNs condense on isolated orientations with small
initialization. The condensation implies that the NN learns features from the
training data and is effectively a much smaller network. In this work, we show
that the singularity of the activation function at original point is a key
factor to understanding the condensation at initial training stage. Our
experiments suggest that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice
of the singularity order. Our theoretical analysis confirms experiments for two
cases, one is for the first-order singularity activation function and the other
is for the one-dimensional input. This work takes a step towards understanding
how small initialization implicitly leads NNs to condensation at initial

fields such as security, anomaly detection, land use planning and land use
change detection. However, critical infrastructures detection in aerial and
satellite images is still a challenge as each one has completely different size
and requires different spacial resolution to be identified correctly.
Heretofore, there are no special datasets for training critical infrastructures
detectors. This paper presents a smart dataset as well as a
resolution-independent critical infrastructure detection system. In particular,
guided by the performance of the detection model, we built a dataset organized
into two scales, small and large scale, and designed a two-stage deep learning
detection of different scale critical infrastructures (DetDSCI) methodology in
ortho-images. DetDSCI methodology first determines the input image zoom level
using a classification model, then analyses the input image with the
appropriate scale detection model. Our experiments show that DetDSCI
methodology achieves up to 37,53% F1 improvement with respect to the baseline
detector.</span>

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as bio-inspired energy-efficient neural
networks, have attracted great attentions from researchers and industry. The
most efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,
the conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,
which impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal
conversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose
Rate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,
enabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose
an optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source
ANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time
can be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised
ANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast
reasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,
PreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6x faster
reasoning performance under 0.265x energy consumption of the typical method.

                                        <span>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have made great
progress in multi-agent domain. However, due to characteristics of RL, training
for complex tasks would be resource-intensive and time-consuming. To meet this
challenge, mutual learning strategy between homogeneous agents is essential,
which is under-explored in previous studies, because most existing methods do
not consider to use the knowledge of agent models. In this paper, we present an
adaptation method of the majority of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
algorithms called KnowSR which takes advantage of the differences in learning
between agents. We employ the idea of knowledge distillation (KD) to share
knowledge among agents to shorten the training phase. To empirically
demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of KnowSR, we performed extensive
experiments on state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in collaborative and
competitive scenarios. The results demonstrate that KnowSR outperforms recently
reported methodologies, emphasizing the importance of the proposed knowledge
sharing for MARL.</span>

                                        <span>Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms have made substantial progress in learning
novel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query
instances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a
support set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume
that those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support
set. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject
to change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work
addresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under
Support/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled
from related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.
First, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines
and a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe
that well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable
drop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.
Finally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect
of DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal
Transport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT
with the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments
demonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of
research by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at

linear advection-reaction problem with discontinuous solution. The method is a
discretization of an equivalent least-squares formulation in the set of neural
network functions with the ReLU activation function. The method is capable of
approximating the discontinuous interface of the underlying problem
automatically through the free hyper-planes of the ReLU neural network and,
hence, outperforms mesh-based numerical methods in terms of the number of
degrees of freedom. Numerical results of some benchmark test problems show that
the method can not only approximate the solution with the least number of
parameters, but also avoid the common Gibbs phenomena along the discontinuous
interface. Moreover, a three-layer ReLU neural network is necessary and
sufficient in order to well approximate a discontinuous solution with an
interface in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that is not a straight line.</span>

                                        <span>The abundance of training data is not guaranteed in various supervised
learning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional
damage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building
requires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A
practical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential
learning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases
that are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information
theoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective
criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample
selection scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI
algorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local
kernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the
adaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the
original formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local
kernels methodology is developed that allows for the conformability of the
kernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational
complexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to
work on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel
hyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood
estimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters
can be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion
performance. The advantages are demonstrated on a simulation of the 2018
Anchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm
enables GPR to reach acceptable performance with fewer training data, the
computational demands remain lower than the standard local kernels strategy.</span>

used in classification tasks. It reuses prior knowledge from other tasks to
pre-train networks for new tasks. In reinforcement learning, learning actions
for a behavior policy that can be applied to new environments is still a
challenge, especially for tasks that involve much planning. Sokoban is a
challenging puzzle game. It has been used widely as a benchmark in
planning-based reinforcement learning. In this paper, we show how prior
knowledge improves learning in Sokoban tasks. We find that reusing feature
representations learned previously can accelerate learning new, more complex,
instances. In effect, we show how curriculum learning, from simple to complex
tasks, works in Sokoban. Furthermore, feature representations learned in
simpler instances are more general, and thus lead to positive transfers towards
more complex tasks, but not vice versa. We have also studied which part of the
knowledge is most important for transfer to succeed, and identify which layers
should be used for pre-training.</span>

general paradigm of self-supervised learning for node representations of graph
data to enable the wide applicability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks
(GCNNs). We formalize the proposed model from an information-theoretic
perspective, by maximizing the mutual information between topology
transformations and node representations before and after the transformations.
We derive that maximizing such mutual information can be relaxed to minimizing
the cross entropy between the applied topology transformation and its
estimation from node representations. In particular, we seek to sample a subset
of node pairs from the original graph and flip the edge connectivity between
each pair to transform the graph topology. Then, we self-train a representation
encoder to learn node representations by reconstructing the topology
transformations from the feature representations of the original and
transformed graphs. In experiments, we apply the proposed model to the
downstream node and graph classification tasks, and results show that the

                                        <span>In partially observable reinforcement learning, offline training gives access
to latent information which is not available during online training and/or
execution, such as the system state. Asymmetric actor-critic methods exploit
such information by training a history-based policy via a state-based critic.
However, many asymmetric methods lack theoretical foundation, and are only
evaluated on limited domains. We examine the theory of asymmetric actor-critic
methods which use state-based critics, and expose fundamental issues which
undermine the validity of a common variant, and its ability to address high
partial observability. We propose an unbiased asymmetric actor-critic variant
which is able to exploit state information while remaining theoretically sound,
maintaining the validity of the policy gradient theorem, and introducing no
bias and relatively low variance into the training process. An empirical
evaluation performed on domains which exhibit significant partial observability
confirms our analysis, and shows the unbiased asymmetric actor-critic converges
to better policies and/or faster than symmetric actor-critic and standard
asymmetric actor-critic baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Recent breakthroughs of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) extend the field&#x27;s
research scope towards a broader range of vision tasks and more diversified
search spaces. While existing NAS methods mostly design architectures on a
single task, algorithms that look beyond single-task search are surging to
pursue a more efficient and universal solution across various tasks. Many of
them leverage transfer learning and seek to preserve, reuse, and refine network
design knowledge to achieve higher efficiency in future tasks. However, the
enormous computational cost and experiment complexity of cross-task NAS are
imposing barriers for valuable research in this direction. Existing NAS
benchmarks all focus on one type of vision task, i.e., classification. In this
work, we propose TransNAS-Bench-101, a benchmark dataset containing network
performance across seven tasks, covering classification, regression,
pixel-level prediction, and self-supervised tasks. This diversity provides
opportunities to transfer NAS methods among tasks and allows for more complex
transfer schemes to evolve. We explore two fundamentally different types of
search space: cell-level search space and macro-level search space. With 7,352
backbones evaluated on seven tasks, 51,464 trained models with detailed
training information are provided. With TransNAS-Bench-101, we hope to
encourage the advent of exceptional NAS algorithms that raise cross-task search
efficiency and generalizability to the next level. Our dataset file will be
available at Mindspore, VEGA.</span>

features are interpretable. However, much modern machine learning focuses on
complex data such as images, text, and graphs where deep learning is used but
the raw features of data are not interpretable. This paper explores a novel
setting for performing clustering on complex data while simultaneously
generating explanations using interpretable tags. We propose deep descriptive
clustering that performs sub-symbolic representation learning on complex data
while generating explanations based on symbolic data. We form good clusters by
maximizing the mutual information between empirical distribution on the inputs
and the induced clustering labels for clustering objectives. We generate
explanations by solving an integer linear programming that generates concise
and orthogonal descriptions for each cluster. Finally, we allow the explanation
to inform better clustering by proposing a novel pairwise loss with
self-generated constraints to maximize the clustering and explanation module&#x27;s
consistency. Experimental results on public data demonstrate that our model
outperforms competitive baselines in clustering performance while offering
high-quality cluster-level explanations.</span>

                                        <span>Creating intelligent systems capable of recognizing emotions is a difficult
task, especially when looking at emotions in animals. This paper describes the
process of designing a &quot;proof of concept&quot; system to recognize emotions in
horses. This system is formed by two elements, a detector and a model. The
detector is a faster region-based convolutional neural network that detects
horses in an image. The second one, the model, is a convolutional neural
network that predicts the emotion of those horses. These two models were
trained with multiple images of horses until they achieved high accuracy in
their tasks, creating therefore the desired system. 400 images of horses were
used to train both the detector and the model while 80 were used to validate
the system. Once the two components were validated they were combined into a
testable system that would detect equine emotions based on established
behavioral ethograms indicating emotional affect through head, neck, ear,
muzzle, and eye position. The system showed an accuracy of between 69% and 74%
on the validation set, demonstrating that it is possible to predict emotions in
animals using autonomous intelligent systems. It is a first &quot;proof of concept&quot;
approach that can be enhanced in many ways. Such a system has multiple
applications including further studies in the growing field of animal emotions
as well as in the veterinary field to determine the physical welfare of horses
or other livestock.</span>

                                        <span>The proliferation of optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopies gives
rise to large volumes of imaging data of objects as diversified as cells,
bacteria, pollen, to nanoparticles and atoms and molecules. In most cases, the
experimental data streams contain images having arbitrary rotations and
translations within the image. At the same time, for many cases, small amounts
of labeled data are available in the form of prior published results, image
collections, and catalogs, or even theoretical models. Here we develop an
approach that allows generalizing from a small subset of labeled data with a
weak orientational disorder to a large unlabeled dataset with a much stronger
orientational (and positional) disorder, i.e., it performs a classification of
image data given a small number of examples even in the presence of a
distribution shift between the labeled and unlabeled parts. This approach is
based on the semi-supervised rotationally invariant variational autoencoder
(ss-rVAE) model consisting of the encoder-decoder &quot;block&quot; that learns a
rotationally (and translationally) invariant continuous latent representation
of data and a classifier that encodes data into a finite number of discrete
classes. The classifier part of the trained ss-rVAE inherits the rotational
(and translational) invariances and can be deployed independently of the other
parts of the model. The performance of the ss-rVAE is illustrated using the
synthetic data sets with known factors of variation. We further demonstrate its
application for experimental data sets of nanoparticles, creating nanoparticle
libraries and disentangling the representations defining the physical factors
of variation in the data. The code reproducing the results is available at

                                        <span>Stroke order and velocity are helpful features in the fields of signature
verification, handwriting recognition, and handwriting synthesis. Recovering
these features from offline handwritten text is a challenging and well-studied
problem. We propose a new model called TRACE (Trajectory Recovery by an
Adaptively-trained Convolutional Encoder). TRACE is a differentiable approach
that uses a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) to infer temporal
stroke information from long lines of offline handwritten text with many
characters and dynamic time warping (DTW) to align predictions and ground truth
points. TRACE is perhaps the first system to be trained end-to-end on entire
lines of text of arbitrary width and does not require the use of dynamic
exemplars. Moreover, the system does not require images to undergo any
pre-processing, nor do the predictions require any post-processing.
Consequently, the recovered trajectory is differentiable and can be used as a
loss function for other tasks, including synthesizing offline handwritten text.

We demonstrate that temporal stroke information recovered by TRACE from
offline data can be used for handwriting synthesis and establish the first
benchmarks for a stroke trajectory recovery system trained on the IAM online
handwriting dataset.</span>

affected by infectious diseases such as COVID-19.Determining the volume of
lungs affected by lesions is essential for formulating treatment
recommendations and prioritizingpatients by severity of the disease. In this
paper we adopted an approach based on using an ensemble of deep
convolutionalneural networks for segmentation of slices of lung CT scans. Using
our models we are able to segment the lesions, evaluatepatients dynamics,
estimate relative volume of lungs affected by lesions and evaluate the lung
damage stage. Our modelswere trained on data from different medical centers. We
compared predictions of our models with those of six experiencedradiologists
and our segmentation model outperformed most of them. On the task of
classification of disease severity, ourmodel outperformed all the radiologists.</span>

                                        <span>Modern multi-document summarization (MDS) methods are based on transformer
architectures. They generate state of the art summaries, but lack
explainability. We focus on graph-based transformer models for MDS as they
gained recent popularity. We aim to improve the explainability of the
graph-based MDS by analyzing their attention weights. In a graph-based MDS such
as GraphSum, vertices represent the textual units, while the edges form some
similarity graph over the units. We compare GraphSum&#x27;s performance utilizing
different textual units, i. e., sentences versus paragraphs, on two news
benchmark datasets, namely WikiSum and MultiNews. Our experiments show that
paragraph-level representations provide the best summarization performance.
Thus, we subsequently focus oAnalysisn analyzing the paragraph-level attention
weights of GraphSum&#x27;s multi-heads and decoding layers in order to improve the
explainability of a transformer-based MDS model. As a reference metric, we
calculate the ROUGE scores between the input paragraphs and each sentence in
the generated summary, which indicate source origin information via text
similarity. We observe a high correlation between the attention weights and
this reference metric, especially on the the later decoding layers of the
transformer architecture. Finally, we investigate if the generated summaries
follow a pattern of positional bias by extracting which paragraph provided the
most information for each generated summary. Our results show that there is a
high correlation between the position in the summary and the source origin.</span>

years with scientists and researchers aiming to utilize the benefits afforded
by advances in machine learning, particularly in deep learning. With large
scientific data sets with rich spatio-temporal data and high-performance
computing providing large amounts of data to be inferred and interpreted, the
task of PIML is to ensure that these predictions, categorizations, and
inferences are enforced by, and conform to the limits imposed by physical laws.
In this work a new approach to utilizing PIML is discussed that deals with the
use of physics-based loss functions. While typical usage of physical equations
in the loss function requires complex layers of derivatives and other functions
to ensure that the known governing equation is satisfied, here we show that a
similar level of enforcement can be found by implementing more simpler loss
functions on specific kinds of output data. The generalizability that this
approach affords is shown using examples of simple mechanical models that can
be thought of as sufficiently simplified surrogate models for a wide class of
problems.</span>

                                        <span>Social reviews are indispensable resources for modern consumers&#x27; decision
making. For financial gain, companies pay fraudsters preferably in groups to
demote or promote products and services since consumers are more likely to be
misled by a large number of similar reviews from groups. Recent approaches on
fraudster group detection employed handcrafted features of group behaviors
without considering the semantic relation between reviews from the reviewers in
a group. In this paper, we propose the first neural approach, HIN-RNN, a
Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) Compatible RNN for fraudster group
detection that requires no handcrafted features. HIN-RNN provides a unifying
architecture for representation learning of each reviewer, with the initial
vector as the sum of word embeddings of all review text written by the same
reviewer, concatenated by the ratio of negative reviews. Given a co-review
network representing reviewers who have reviewed the same items with the same
ratings and the reviewers&#x27; vector representation, a collaboration matrix is
acquired through HIN-RNN training. The proposed approach is confirmed to be
effective with marked improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on both the
Yelp (22% and 12% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) and Amazon (4%

                                        <span>It is by now well-known that small adversarial perturbations can induce
classification errors in deep neural networks. In this paper, we take a
bottom-up signal processing perspective to this problem and show that a
systematic exploitation of sparsity in natural data is a promising tool for
defense. For linear classifiers, we show that a sparsifying front end is
provably effective against $\ell_{\infty}$-bounded attacks, reducing output
distortion due to the attack by a factor of roughly $K/N$ where $N$ is the data
dimension and $K$ is the sparsity level. We then extend this concept to deep
networks, showing that a &quot;locally linear&quot; model can be used to develop a
theoretical foundation for crafting attacks and defenses. We also devise
attacks based on the locally linear model that outperform the well-known FGSM
attack. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments on the MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets, showing the efficacy of the proposed sparsity-based defense
schemes.</span>

                                        <span>The ability to generalize from observed to new related environments is
central to any form of reliable machine learning, yet most methods fail when
moving beyond i.i.d data. This work argues that in some cases the reason lies
in a misapreciation of the causal structure in data; and in particular due to
the influence of unobserved confounders which void many of the invariances and
principles of minimum error between environments presently used for the problem
of domain generalization. This observation leads us to study generalization in
the context of a broader class of interventions in an underlying causal model
(including changes in observed, unobserved and target variable distributions)
and to connect this causal intuition with an explicit distributionally robust
optimization problem. From this analysis derives a new proposal for model
learning with explicit generalization guarantees that is based on the partial
equality of error derivatives with respect to model parameters. We demonstrate
the empirical performance of our approach on healthcare data from different
modalities, including image, speech and tabular data.</span>

propose a practical self-imitation learning method named Self-Imitation
Learning with Constant Reward (SILCR). Instead of requiring hand-defined
immediate rewards from environments, our method assigns the immediate rewards
at each timestep with constant values according to their final episodic
rewards. In this way, even if the dense rewards from environments are
unavailable, every action taken by the agents would be guided properly. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in some challenging continuous
robotics control tasks in MuJoCo simulation and the results show that our
method significantly outperforms the alternative methods in tasks with sparse

                                        <span>Distributed learning provides an attractive framework for scaling the
learning task by sharing the computational load over multiple nodes in a
network. Here, we investigate the performance of distributed learning for
large-scale linear regression where the model parameters, i.e., the unknowns,
are distributed over the network. We adopt a statistical learning approach. In
contrast to works that focus on the performance on the training data, we focus
on the generalization error, i.e., the performance on unseen data. We provide
high-probability bounds on the generalization error for both isotropic and
correlated Gaussian data as well as sub-gaussian data. These results reveal the
dependence of the generalization performance on the partitioning of the model
over the network. In particular, our results show that the generalization error
of the distributed solution can be substantially higher than that of the
centralized solution even when the error on the training data is at the same
level for both the centralized and distributed approaches. Our numerical
results illustrate the performance with both real-world image data as well as
synthetic data.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, promotes
personal privacy by local data processing at each client. However, relying on a
centralized server for model aggregation, standard FL is vulnerable to server
malfunctions, untrustworthy server, and external attacks. To address this
issue, we propose a decentralized FL framework by integrating blockchain into
FL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL). In
a round of the proposed BLADE-FL, each client broadcasts the trained model to
other clients, aggregates its own model with received ones, and then competes
to generate a block before its local training of the next round. We evaluate
the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and develop an upper bound on the global
loss function. Then we verify that this bound is convex with respect to the
number of overall aggregation rounds K, and optimize the computing resource
allocation for minimizing the upper bound. We also note that there is a
critical problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize
others&#x27; trained models and add artificial noises to disguise their cheating
behaviors. Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on
the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among
the optimal K, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients.
Based on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show that the experimental
results are consistent with the analytical ones. To be specific, the gap
between the developed upper bound and experimental results is lower than 5%,
and the optimized K based on the upper bound can effectively minimize the loss
function.</span>

paper, we present affine transport -- a variant of optimal transport, which
models the mapping between state transition distributions between the source
and target domains with an affine transformation. First, we derive the affine
transport framework; then, we extend the basic framework with Procrustes
alignment to model arbitrary affine transformations. We evaluate the method in
a number of OpenAI Gym sim-to-sim experiments with simulation environments, as
well as on a sim-to-real domain adaptation task of a robot hitting a hockeypuck
such that it slides and stops at a target position. In each experiment, we
evaluate the results when transferring between each pair of dynamics domains.
The results show that affine transport can significantly reduce the model
adaptation error in comparison to using the original, non-adapted dynamics
model.</span>

                                        <span>Mixture of experts method is a neural network based ensemble learning that
has great ability to improve the overall classification accuracy. This method
is based on the divide and conquer principle, in which the problem space is
divided between several experts by supervisition of gating network. In this
paper, we propose an ensemble learning method based on mixture of experts which
is named mixture of ELM based experts with trainable gating network (MEETG) to
improve the computing cost and to speed up the learning process of ME. The
structure of ME consists of multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) as base experts and
gating network, in which gradient-based learning algorithm is applied for
training the MLPs which is an iterative and time consuming process. In order to
overcome on these problems, we use the advantages of extreme learning machine
(ELM) for designing the structure of ME. ELM as a learning algorithm for single
hidden-layer feed forward neural networks provides much faster learning process
and better generalization ability in comparision with some other traditional
learning algorithms. Also, in the proposed method a trainable gating network is
applied to aggregate the outputs of the experts dynamically according to the
input sample. Our experimental results and statistical analysis on 11 benchmark
datasets confirm that MEETG has an acceptable performance in classification
problems. Furthermore, our experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms the original ELM on prediction stability and classification
accuracy.</span>

task. Most previous works in this domain require human-created metadata of
screens (e.g. View Hierarchy) during inference, which unfortunately is often
not available or reliable enough for GUI understanding. Inspired by the
impressive success of Transformers in NLP tasks, targeting for purely
vision-based GUI understanding, we extend the concepts of Words/Sentence to
Pixel-Words/Screen-Sentence, and propose a mobile GUI understanding
architecture: Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentence (PW2SS). In analogy to the
individual Words, we define the Pixel-Words as atomic visual components (text
and graphic components), which are visually consistent and semantically clear
across screenshots of a large variety of design styles. The Pixel-Words
extracted from a screenshot are aggregated into Screen-Sentence with a Screen
Transformer proposed to model their relations. Since the Pixel-Words are
defined as atomic visual components, the ambiguity between their visual
appearance and semantics is dramatically reduced. We are able to make use of
metadata available in training data to auto-generate high-quality annotations
for Pixel-Words. A dataset, RICO-PW, of screenshots with Pixel-Words
annotations is built based on the public RICO dataset, which will be released
to help to address the lack of high-quality training data in this area. We
train a detector to extract Pixel-Words from screenshots on this dataset and
achieve metadata-free GUI understanding during inference. We conduct
experiments and show that Pixel-Words can be well extracted on RICO-PW and well
generalized to a new dataset, P2S-UI, collected by ourselves. The effectiveness
of PW2SS is further verified in the GUI understanding tasks including relation
prediction, clickability prediction, screen retrieval, and app type
classification.</span>

information and have recently demonstrated exemplary performance in the natural
language processing domain. Conventionally, the temporal action proposal
generation (TAPG) task is divided into two main sub-tasks: boundary prediction
and proposal confidence prediction, which rely on the frame-level dependencies
and proposal-level relationships separately. To capture the dependencies at
different levels of granularity, this paper intuitively presents a unified
temporal action proposal generation framework with original Transformers,
called TAPG Transformer, which consists of a Boundary Transformer and a
Proposal Transformer. Specifically, the Boundary Transformer captures long-term
temporal dependencies to predict precise boundary information and the Proposal
Transformer learns the rich inter-proposal relationships for reliable
confidence evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular
benchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and the results demonstrate that TAPG
Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing
action classifier, our method achieves remarkable performance on the temporal
action localization task. Codes and models will be available.</span>

                                        <span>Food retrieval is an important task to perform analysis of food-related
information, where we are interested in retrieving relevant information about
the queried food item such as ingredients, cooking instructions, etc. In this
paper, we investigate cross-modal retrieval between food images and cooking
recipes. The goal is to learn an embedding of images and recipes in a common
feature space, such that the corresponding image-recipe embeddings lie close to
one another. Two major challenges in addressing this problem are 1) large
intra-variance and small inter-variance across cross-modal food data; and 2)
difficulties in obtaining discriminative recipe representations. To address
these two problems, we propose Semantic-Consistent and Attention-based Networks
(SCAN), which regularize the embeddings of the two modalities through aligning
output semantic probabilities. Besides, we exploit a self-attention mechanism
to improve the embedding of recipes. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed method on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset, and show that we can
outperform several state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval strategies for food
images and cooking recipes by a significant margin.</span>

                                        <span>Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and
crucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on
short-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level
predictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level
prediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves
along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic
Segment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be
more specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional
operation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets
adaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be
combined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform
powerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video
architecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several
video recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,
Something-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed
DSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.
For example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is
improved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400. Codes will be available.</span>

nevertheless, omnidirectional view of these videos demands high bandwidth and
processing power at the end devices. Recently proposed viewport aware streaming
mechanisms can reduce the amount of data transmitted by streaming a limited
portion of the frame covering the current user viewport (VP). However, they
still suffer from sending a high amount of redundant data, as the fixed tile
mechanisms can not provide finer granularity to the user VP. Though making the
tiles smaller can provide a finer granularity for user viewport, high encoding
overhead incurred. To overcome this trade-off, in this paper, we present a
computational geometric approach based adaptive tiling mechanism named VAD360,
which takes visual attention information on the 360{\deg} video frame as the
input and provide a suitable non-overlapping variable size tile cover on the
frame. Experimental results shows that VAD360 can save up to 31.1% of pixel
redundancy before compression and 35.4% of bandwidth saving compared to
recently proposed fixed tile configurations, providing tile schemes within
0.98($\pm$0.11)s time frame.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic embedding has been widely investigated for aligning knowledge graph
(KG) entities. Current methods have explored and utilized the graph structure,
the entity names and attributes, but ignore the ontology (or ontological
schema) which contains critical meta information such as classes and their
membership relationships with entities. In this paper, we propose an
ontology-guided entity alignment method named OntoEA, where both KGs and their
ontologies are jointly embedded, and the class hierarchy and the class
disjointness are utilized to avoid false mappings. Extensive experiments on
seven public and industrial benchmarks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art
performance of OntoEA and the effectiveness of the ontologies.</span>

with as little data as possible, and the influence of language similarity in
this process. We retrain the lexical layers of four BERT-based models using
data from two low-resource target language varieties, while the Transformer
layers are independently fine-tuned on a POS-tagging task in the model&#x27;s source
language. By combining the new lexical layers and fine-tuned Transformer
layers, we achieve high task performance for both target languages. With high
language similarity, 10MB of data appears sufficient to achieve substantial
monolingual transfer performance. Monolingual BERT-based models generally
achieve higher downstream task performance after retraining the lexical layer
than multilingual BERT, even when the target language is included in the

tool for studying compositional aspects of language at the level of semantics,
its strong dependency on pregroup grammars poses important restrictions: first,
it prevents large-scale experimentation due to the absence of a pregroup
parser; and second, it limits the expressibility of the model to context-free
grammars. In this paper we solve these problems by reformulating DisCoCat as a
passage from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to a category of semantics.
We start by showing that standard categorial grammars can be expressed as a
biclosed category, where all rules emerge as currying/uncurrying the identity;
we then proceed to model permutation-inducing rules by exploiting the symmetry
of the compact closed category encoding the word meaning. We provide a proof of
concept for our method, converting &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; into DisCoCat form, a
corpus that we make available to the community.</span>

                                        <span>Writing a coherent and engaging story is not easy. Creative writers use their
knowledge and worldview to put disjointed elements together to form a coherent
storyline, and work and rework iteratively toward perfection. Automated visual
storytelling (VIST) models, however, make poor use of external knowledge and
iterative generation when attempting to create stories. This paper introduces
PR-VIST, a framework that represents the input image sequence as a story graph
in which it finds the best path to form a storyline. PR-VIST then takes this
path and learns to generate the final story via an iterative training process.
This framework produces stories that are superior in terms of diversity,
coherence, and humanness, per both automatic and human evaluations. An ablation
study shows that both plotting and reworking contribute to the model&#x27;s
superiority.</span>

                                        <span>Spell check is a useful application which processes noisy human-generated
text. Spell check for Chinese poses unresolved problems due to the large number
of characters, the sparse distribution of errors, and the dearth of resources
with sufficient coverage of heterogeneous and shifting error domains. For
Chinese spell check, filtering using confusion sets narrows the search space
and makes finding corrections easier. However, most, if not all, confusion sets
used to date are fixed and thus do not include new, shifting error domains. We
propose a scalable adaptable filter that exploits hierarchical character
embeddings to (1) obviate the need to handcraft confusion sets, and (2) resolve
sparsity problems related to infrequent errors. Our approach compares favorably
with competitive baselines and obtains SOTA results on the 2014 and 2015

                                        <span>Question answering systems usually use keyword searches to retrieve potential
passages related to a question, and then extract the answer from passages with
the machine reading comprehension methods. However, many questions tend to be
unanswerable in the real world. In this case, it is significant and challenging
how the model determines when no answer is supported by the passage and
abstains from answering. Most of the existing systems design a simple
classifier to determine answerability implicitly without explicitly modeling
mutual interaction and relation between the question and passage, leading to
the poor performance for determining the unanswerable questions. To tackle this
problem, we propose a Multi-Step Co-Interactive Relation Network (MCR-Net) to
explicitly model the mutual interaction and locate key clues from coarse to
fine by introducing a co-interactive relation module. The co-interactive
relation module contains a stack of interaction and fusion blocks to
continuously integrate and fuse history-guided and current-query-guided clues
in an explicit way. Experiments on the SQuAD 2.0 and DuReader datasets show
that our model achieves a remarkable improvement, outperforming the BERT-style
baselines in literature. Visualization analysis also verifies the importance of
the mutual interaction between the question and passage.</span>

Decoupling Graph is used for understanding local and contextualized connection

trained on a small amount of annotated training data, and evaluated in a small
set from the same distribution. However, these models can lead to system
failure or undesirable output when being exposed to natural language
perturbation or variation in practice. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive
evaluation and analysis with respect to the robustness of natural language
understanding models, and introduce three important aspects related to language
understanding in real-world dialog systems, namely, language variety, speech
characteristics, and noise perturbation. We propose a model-agnostic toolkit
LAUG to approximate natural language perturbations for testing the robustness
issues in task-oriented dialog. Four data augmentation approaches covering the
three aspects are assembled in LAUG, which reveals critical robustness issues
in state-of-the-art models. The augmented dataset through LAUG can be used to
facilitate future research on the robustness testing of language understanding

                                        <span>Event detection tends to struggle when it needs to recognize novel event
types with a few samples. The previous work attempts to solve this problem in
the identify-then-classify manner but ignores the trigger discrepancy between
event types, thus suffering from the error propagation. In this paper, we
present a novel unified model which converts the task to a few-shot tagging
problem with a double-part tagging scheme. To this end, we first propose the
Prototypical Amortized Conditional Random Field (PA-CRF) to model the label
dependency in the few-shot scenario, which approximates the transition scores
between labels based on the label prototypes. Then Gaussian distribution is
introduced for modeling of the transition scores to alleviate the uncertain
estimation resulting from insufficient data. Experimental results show that the
unified models work better than existing identify-then-classify models and our
PA-CRF further achieves the best results on the benchmark dataset FewEvent. Our

                                        <span>Slang is a common type of informal language, but its flexible nature and
paucity of data resources present challenges for existing natural language
systems. We take an initial step toward machine generation of slang by
developing a framework that models the speaker&#x27;s word choice in slang context.
Our framework encodes novel slang meaning by relating the conventional and
slang senses of a word while incorporating syntactic and contextual knowledge
in slang usage. We construct the framework using a combination of probabilistic
inference and neural contrastive learning. We perform rigorous evaluations on
three slang dictionaries and show that our approach not only outperforms
state-of-the-art language models, but also better predicts the historical
emergence of slang word usages from 1960s to 2000s. We interpret the proposed
models and find that the contrastively learned semantic space is sensitive to
the similarities between slang and conventional senses of words. Our work
creates opportunities for the automated generation and interpretation of
informal language.</span>

                                        <span>Existing methods for vision-and-language learning typically require designing
task-specific architectures and objectives for each task. For example, a
multi-label answer classifier for visual question answering, a region scorer
for referring expression comprehension, and a language decoder for image
captioning, etc. To alleviate these hassles, in this work, we propose a unified
framework that learns different tasks in a single architecture with the same
language modeling objective, i.e., multimodal conditional text generation,
where our models learn to generate labels in text based on the visual and
textual inputs. On 7 popular vision-and-language benchmarks, including visual
question answering, referring expression comprehension, visual commonsense
reasoning, most of which have been previously modeled as discriminative tasks,
our generative approach (with a single unified architecture) reaches comparable
performance to recent task-specific state-of-the-art vision-and-language
models. Moreover, our generative approach shows better generalization ability
on questions that have rare answers. Also, we show that our framework allows
multi-task learning in a single architecture with a single set of parameters,
achieving similar performance to separately optimized single-task models. Our

                                        <span>Transformers are not suited for processing long documents, due to their
quadratically increasing memory and time consumption. Simply truncating a long
document or applying the sparse attention mechanism will incur the context
fragmentation problem or lead to an inferior modeling capability against
comparable model sizes. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-Doc, a document-level
language pretraining model based on Recurrence Transformers. Two well-designed
techniques, namely the retrospective feed mechanism and the enhanced recurrence
mechanism, enable ERNIE-Doc, which has a much longer effective context length,
to capture the contextual information of a complete document. We pretrain
ERNIE-Doc to explicitly learn the relationships among segments with an
additional document-aware segment-reordering objective. Various experiments
were conducted on both English and Chinese document-level tasks. ERNIE-Doc
improved the state-of-the-art language modeling result of perplexity to 16.8 on
WikiText-103. Moreover, it outperformed competitive pretraining models by a
large margin on most language understanding tasks, such as text classification
and question answering.</span>

                                        <span>We investigate the reasoning ability of pretrained vision and language (V&amp;L)
models in two tasks that require multimodal integration: (1) discriminating a
correct image-sentence pair from an incorrect one, and (2) counting entities in
an image. We evaluate three pretrained V&amp;L models on these tasks: ViLBERT,
ViLBERT 12-in-1 and LXMERT, in zero-shot and finetuned settings. Our results
show that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are
pretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&amp;L models is able to
adequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to
out-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these
findings: LXMERT (and to some extent ViLBERT 12-in-1) show some evidence of
catastrophic forgetting on task (1). Concerning our results on the counting
probe, we find evidence that all models are impacted by dataset bias, and also
fail to individuate entities in the visual input. While a selling point of
pretrained V&amp;L models is their ability to solve complex tasks, our findings
suggest that understanding their reasoning and grounding capabilities requires
more targeted investigations on specific phenomena.</span>

other languages lag behind, in part due to data and computational limitations.
We propose a method that may overcome these problems by adapting existing
pre-trained models to new languages. Specifically, we describe the adaptation
of English GPT-2 to Italian and Dutch by retraining lexical embeddings without
tuning the Transformer layers. As a result, we obtain lexical embeddings for
Italian and Dutch that are aligned with the original English lexical
embeddings. Additionally, we scale up complexity by transforming relearned
lexical embeddings of GPT-2 small to the GPT-2 medium embedding space. This
method minimises the amount of training and prevents losing information during
adaptation that was learned by GPT-2. English GPT-2 models with relearned
lexical embeddings can generate realistic sentences in Italian and Dutch.
Though on average these sentences are still identifiable as artificial by
humans, they are assessed on par with sentences generated by a GPT-2 model
fully trained from scratch.</span>

                                        <span>NLP has a rich history of representing our prior understanding of language in
the form of graphs. Recent work on analyzing contextualized text
representations has focused on hand-designed probe models to understand how and
to what extent do these representations encode a particular linguistic
phenomenon. However, due to the inter-dependence of various phenomena and
randomness of training probe models, detecting how these representations encode
the rich information in these linguistic graphs remains a challenging problem.
In this paper, we propose a new information-theoretic probe, Bird&#x27;s Eye, which
is a fairly simple probe method for detecting if and how these representations
encode the information in these linguistic graphs. Instead of using classifier
performance, our probe takes an information-theoretic view of probing and
estimates the mutual information between the linguistic graph embedded in a
continuous space and the contextualized word representations. Furthermore, we
also propose an approach to use our probe to investigate localized linguistic
information in the linguistic graphs using perturbation analysis. We call this
probing setup Worm&#x27;s Eye. Using these probes, we analyze BERT models on their
ability to encode a syntactic and a semantic graph structure, and find that
these models encode to some degree both syntactic as well as semantic
information; albeit syntactic information to a greater extent.</span>

given a text in 124 source languages, we translate it into a severely low
resource language using only ~1,000 lines of low resource data without any
external help. Firstly, we propose a systematic method to rank and choose
source languages that are close to the low resource language. We call the
linguistic definition of language family Family of Origin (FAMO), and we call
the empirical definition of higher-ranked languages using our metrics Family of
Choice (FAMC). Secondly, we build an Iteratively Pretrained Multilingual
Order-preserving Lexiconized Transformer (IPML) to train on ~1,000 lines
(~3.5%) of low resource data. To translate named entities correctly, we build a
massive lexicon table for 2,939 Bible named entities in 124 source languages,
and include many that occur once and covers more than 66 severely low resource
languages. Moreover, we also build a novel method of combining translations
from different source languages into one. Using English as a hypothetical low
resource language, we get a +23.9 BLEU increase over a multilingual baseline,
and a +10.3 BLEU increase over our asymmetric baseline in the Bible dataset. We
get a 42.8 BLEU score for Portuguese-English translation on the medical EMEA

                                        <span>In open-domain question answering (QA), retrieve-and-read mechanism has the
inherent benefit of interpretability and the easiness of adding, removing, or
editing knowledge compared to the parametric approaches of closed-book QA
models. However, it is also known to suffer from its large storage footprint
due to its document corpus and index. Here, we discuss several orthogonal
strategies to drastically reduce the footprint of a retrieve-and-read
open-domain QA system by up to 160x. Our results indicate that
retrieve-and-read can be a viable option even in a highly constrained serving
environment such as edge devices, as we show that it can achieve better
accuracy than a purely parametric model with comparable docker-level system
size.</span>

expanded from professional, editor-lead journalism all the way to citizen
journalism. Nowadays, politicians and other key players enjoy direct access to
their audiences through social media, bypassing the filters of official cables
or traditional media. However, the multiple advantages of free speech and
direct communication are dimmed by the misuse of media to spread inaccurate or
misleading claims. These phenomena have led to the modern incarnation of the
fact-checker -- a professional whose main aim is to examine claims using
available evidence and to assess their veracity. As in other text forensics
tasks, the amount of information available makes the work of the fact-checker
more difficult. With this in mind, starting from the perspective of the
professional fact-checker, we survey the available intelligent technologies
that can support the human expert in the different steps of her fact-checking
endeavor. These include identifying claims worth fact-checking, detecting
relevant previously fact-checked claims, retrieving relevant evidence to
fact-check a claim, and actually verifying a claim. In each case, we pay
attention to the challenges in future work and the potential impact on
real-world fact-checking.</span>

Motivated by the recent finding that models trained with random negative
samples are not ideal in real-world scenarios, we propose a hierarchical
curriculum learning framework that trains the matching model in an
&quot;easy-to-difficult&quot; scheme. Our learning framework consists of two
complementary curricula: (1) corpus-level curriculum (CC); and (2)
instance-level curriculum (IC). In CC, the model gradually increases its
ability in finding the matching clues between the dialogue context and a
response candidate. As for IC, it progressively strengthens the model&#x27;s ability
in identifying the mismatching information between the dialogue context and a
response candidate. Empirical studies on three benchmark datasets with three

designed for questions that require either single-hop or multi-hop reasoning,
which make strong assumptions of the complexity of questions to be answered.
Also, multi-step document retrieval often incurs higher number of relevant but
non-supporting documents, which dampens the downstream noise-sensitive reader
module for answer extraction. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
QA framework to answer any-hop open-domain questions, which iteratively
retrieves, reranks and filters documents, and adaptively determines when to
stop the retrieval process. To improve the retrieval accuracy, we propose a
graph-based reranking model that perform multi-document interaction as the core
of our iterative reranking framework. Our method consistently achieves
performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art on both
single-hop and multi-hop open-domain QA datasets, including Natural Questions
Open, SQuAD Open, and HotpotQA.</span>

Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Despite all the notable
advancements, current KGQA datasets only provide the answers as the direct
output result of the formal query, rather than full sentences incorporating
question context. For achieving coherent answers sentence with the question&#x27;s
vocabulary, template-based verbalization so are usually employed for a better
representation of answers, which in turn require extensive expert intervention.
Thus, making way for machine learning approaches; however, there is a scarcity
of datasets that empower machine learning models in this area. Hence, we
provide the VANiLLa dataset which aims at reducing this gap by offering answers
in natural language sentences. The answer sentences in this dataset are
syntactically and semantically closer to the question than to the triple fact.
Our dataset consists of over 100k simple questions adapted from the CSQA and
SimpleQuestionsWikidata datasets and generated using a semi-automatic
framework. We also present results of training our dataset on multiple baseline
models adapted from current state-of-the-art Natural Language Generation (NLG)
architectures. We believe that this dataset will allow researchers to focus on

learning from a few examples, but prior work uses many held-out examples to
tune various aspects of learning, such as hyperparameters, training objectives,
and natural language templates (&quot;prompts&quot;). Here, we evaluate the few-shot
ability of LMs when such held-out examples are unavailable, a setting we call
true few-shot learning. We test two model selection criteria, cross-validation
and minimum description length, for choosing LM prompts and hyperparameters in
the true few-shot setting. On average, both marginally outperform random
selection and greatly underperform selection based on held-out examples.
Moreover, selection criteria often prefer models that perform significantly
worse than randomly-selected ones. We find similar results even when taking
into account our uncertainty in a model&#x27;s true performance during selection, as
well as when varying the amount of computation and number of examples used for
selection. Overall, our findings suggest that prior work significantly
overestimated the true few-shot ability of LMs given the difficulty of few-shot

(seq2seq), non-parallel voice conversion approach, which utilizes text
supervision during training. In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature
extractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an
encoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention
(CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck
layer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract
speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from
spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based
seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the
bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker
identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using
seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral
feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a
discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme
recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed
approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective
evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice
conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity.
Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature
selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC
approach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as
one/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and
subjective evaluations.</span>

                                        <span>Pretrained language models (PLMs) perform poorly under adversarial attacks.
To improve the adversarial robustness, adversarial data augmentation (ADA) has
been widely adopted to cover more search space of adversarial attacks by adding
textual adversarial examples during training. However, the number of
adversarial examples for text augmentation is still extremely insufficient due
to the exponentially large attack search space. In this work, we propose a
simple and effective method to cover a much larger proportion of the attack
search space, called Adversarial and Mixup Data Augmentation (AMDA).
Specifically, AMDA linearly interpolates the representations of pairs of
training samples to form new virtual samples, which are more abundant and
diverse than the discrete text adversarial examples in conventional ADA.
Moreover, to fairly evaluate the robustness of different models, we adopt a
challenging evaluation setup, which generates a new set of adversarial examples
targeting each model. In text classification experiments of BERT and RoBERTa,
AMDA achieves significant robustness gains under two strong adversarial attacks
and alleviates the performance degradation of ADA on the clean data. Our code

                                        <span>Educational content labeled with proper knowledge components (KCs) are
particularly useful to teachers or content organizers. However, manually
labeling educational content is labor intensive and error-prone. To address
this challenge, prior research proposed machine learning based solutions to
auto-label educational content with limited success. In this work, we
significantly improve prior research by (1) expanding the input types to
include KC descriptions, instructional video titles, and problem descriptions
(i.e., three types of prediction task), (2) doubling the granularity of the
prediction from 198 to 385 KC labels (i.e., more practical setting but much
harder multinomial classification problem), (3) improving the prediction
accuracies by 0.5-2.3% using Task-adaptive Pre-trained BERT, outperforming six
baselines, and (4) proposing a simple evaluation measure by which we can
recover 56-73% of mispredicted KC labels. All codes and data sets in the

                                        <span>Unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) that relies solely on massive
monolingual corpora has achieved remarkable results in several translation
tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, massive monolingual corpora do not
exist for some extremely low-resource languages such as Estonian, and UNMT
systems usually perform poorly when there is not adequate training corpus for
one language. In this paper, we first define and analyze the unbalanced
training data scenario for UNMT. Based on this scenario, we propose UNMT
self-training mechanisms to train a robust UNMT system and improve its
performance in this case. Experimental results on several language pairs show
that the proposed methods substantially outperform conventional UNMT systems.</span>

state-of-the-art Transformer models. But is it really required? This paper
investigates the true importance and contribution of the dot product-based
self-attention mechanism on the performance of Transformer models. Via
extensive experiments, we find that (1) random alignment matrices surprisingly
perform quite competitively and (2) learning attention weights from token-token
(query-key) interactions is useful but not that important after all. To this
end, we propose \textsc{Synthesizer}, a model that learns synthetic attention
weights without token-token interactions. In our experiments, we first show
that simple Synthesizers achieve highly competitive performance when compared
against vanilla Transformer models across a range of tasks, including machine
translation, language modeling, text generation and GLUE/SuperGLUE benchmarks.
When composed with dot product attention, we find that Synthesizers
consistently outperform Transformers. Moreover, we conduct additional
comparisons of Synthesizers against Dynamic Convolutions, showing that simple
Random Synthesizer is not only $60\%$ faster but also improves perplexity by a
relative $3.5\%$. Finally, we show that simple factorized Synthesizers can
outperform Linformers on encoding only tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Biomedical entity linking aims to map biomedical mentions, such as diseases
and drugs, to standard entities in a given knowledge base. The specific
challenge in this context is that the same biomedical entity can have a wide
range of names, including synonyms, morphological variations, and names with
different word orderings. Recently, BERT-based methods have advanced the
state-of-the-art by allowing for rich representations of word sequences.
However, they often have hundreds of millions of parameters and require heavy
computing resources, which limits their applications in resource-limited
scenarios. Here, we propose a lightweight neural method for biomedical entity
linking, which needs just a fraction of the parameters of a BERT model and much
less computing resources. Our method uses a simple alignment layer with
attention mechanisms to capture the variations between mention and entity
names. Yet, we show that our model is competitive with previous work on
standard evaluation benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>We propose multi-microphone complex spectral mapping, a simple way of
applying deep learning for time-varying non-linear beamforming, for speaker
separation in reverberant conditions. We aim at both speaker separation and
dereverberation. Our study first investigates offline utterance-wise speaker
separation and then extends to block-online continuous speech separation (CSS).
Assuming a fixed array geometry between training and testing, we train deep
neural networks (DNN) to predict the real and imaginary (RI) components of
target speech at a reference microphone from the RI components of multiple
microphones. We then integrate multi-microphone complex spectral mapping with
minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming and post-filtering
to further improve separation, and combine it with frame-level speaker counting
for block-online CSS. Although our system is trained on simulated room impulse
responses (RIR) based on a fixed number of microphones arranged in a given
geometry, it generalizes well to a real array with the same geometry.
State-of-the-art separation performance is obtained on the simulated two-talker
SMS-WSJ corpus and the real-recorded LibriCSS dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Recent unsupervised machine translation (UMT) systems usually employ three
main principles: initialization, language modeling and iterative
back-translation, though they may apply them differently. Crucially, iterative
back-translation and denoising auto-encoding for language modeling provide data
diversity to train the UMT systems. However, the gains from these
diversification processes has seemed to plateau. We introduce a novel component
to the standard UMT framework called Cross-model Back-translated Distillation
(CBD), that is aimed to induce another level of data diversification that
existing principles lack. CBD is applicable to all previous UMT approaches. In
our experiments, CBD achieves the state of the art in the WMT&#x27;14
English-French, WMT&#x27;16 English-German and English-Romanian bilingual
unsupervised translation tasks, with 38.2, 30.1, and 36.3 BLEU respectively. It
also yields 1.5-3.3 BLEU improvements in IWSLT English-French and
English-German tasks. Through extensive experimental analyses, we show that CBD
is effective because it embraces data diversity while other similar variants do
not.</span>

performance on almost all NLP tasks. By using additional prompts to fine-tune
PLMs, we can further stimulate the rich knowledge distributed in PLMs to better
serve downstream task. Prompt tuning has achieved promising results on some
few-class classification tasks such as sentiment classification and natural
language inference. However, manually designing lots of language prompts is
cumbersome and fallible. For those auto-generated prompts, it is also expensive
and time-consuming to verify their effectiveness in non-few-shot scenarios.
Hence, it is challenging for prompt tuning to address many-class classification
tasks. To this end, we propose prompt tuning with rules (PTR) for many-class
text classification, and apply logic rules to construct prompts with several
sub-prompts. In this way, PTR is able to encode prior knowledge of each class
into prompt tuning. We conduct experiments on relation classification, a
typical many-class classification task, and the results on benchmarks show that
PTR can significantly and consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art
baselines. This indicates that PTR is a promising approach to take advantage of
PLMs for those complicated classification tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Virtual Personal Assistants like Siri have great potential but such
developments hit the fundamental problem of how to make computational devices
that understand human speech. Natural language understanding is one of the more
disappointing failures of AI research and it seems there is something we
computer scientists don&#x27;t get about the nature of language. Of course
philosophers and linguists think quite differently about language and this
paper describes how we have taken ideas from other disciplines and implemented
them. The background to the work is to take seriously the notion of language as
action and look at what people actually do with language using the techniques
of Conversation Analysis. The observation has been that human communication is
(behind the scenes) about the management of social relations as well as the
(foregrounded) passing of information. To claim this is one thing but to
implement it requires a mechanism. The mechanism described here is based on the
notion of language being intentional - we think intentionally, talk about them
and recognise them in others - and cooperative in that we are compelled to help
out. The way we are compelled points to a solution to the ever present problem
of keeping the human on topic. The approach has led to a recent success in
which we significantly improve user satisfaction independent of task
completion. Talk Markup Language (TalkML) is a draft alternative to VoiceXML
that, we propose, greatly simplifies the scripting of interaction by providing
default behaviours for no input and not recognised speech events.</span>

guidelines for Danish nested named entities (NEs) and lexical normalization to
support research on cross-lingual cross-domain learning for a less-resourced

Entity Recognition (NER) task. We compare transfer capabilities from German

multilingual BERT, and study the effect of lexical normalization on NER. Our
results show that 1) the most robust strategy is multi-task learning which is
rivaled by multi-label decoding, 2) BERT-based NER models are sensitive to
domain shifts, and 3) in-language BERT and lexical normalization are the most
beneficial on the least canonical data. Our results also show that an
out-of-domain setup remains challenging, while performance on news plateaus
quickly. This highlights the importance of cross-domain evaluation of
cross-lingual transfer.</span>

achieved remarkable results on varieties of NLP tasks. Recent works have shown
that attention-based models can benefit from more focused attention over local
regions. Most of them restrict the attention scope within a linear span, or
confine to certain tasks such as machine translation and question answering. In
this paper, we propose a syntax-aware local attention, where the attention
scopes are restrained based on the distances in the syntactic structure. The
proposed syntax-aware local attention can be integrated with pretrained
language models, such as BERT, to render the model to focus on syntactically
relevant words. We conduct experiments on various single-sentence benchmarks,
including sentence classification and sequence labeling tasks. Experimental
results show consistent gains over BERT on all benchmark datasets. The
extensive studies verify that our model achieves better performance owing to

retained much of their ancient magical power&quot;. By words, behaviors are
transformed and problems are solved. The way we use words reveals our
intentions, goals and values. Novel tools for text analysis help understand the
magical power of words. This power is multiplied, if it is combined with the
study of social networks, i.e. with the analysis of relationships among social
units. This special issue of the International Journal of Information
Management, entitled &quot;Combining Social Network Analysis and Text Mining: from
Theory to Practice&quot;, includes heterogeneous and innovative research at the
nexus of text mining and social network analysis. It aims to enrich work at the
intersection of these fields, which still lags behind in theoretical,
empirical, and methodological foundations. The nine articles accepted for
inclusion in this special issue all present methods and tools that have
business applications. They are summarized in this editorial introduction.</span>

the assessment of organizational leadership styles, as appearing to Twitter
users. We collected Twitter data over 51 days, related to the first 30 Italian
organizations in the 2015 ranking of Forbes Global 2000-out of which we
selected the five with the most relevant volumes of tweets. We analyzed the
communication of the company leaders, together with the dialogue among the
stakeholders of each company, to understand the association with perceived
leadership styles and dimensions. To assess leadership profiles, we referred to
the 10-factor model developed by Barchiesi and La Bella in 2007. We maintain
the distinctiveness of the approach we propose, as it allows a rapid assessment
of the perceived leadership capabilities of an enterprise, as they emerge from
its social media interactions. It can also be used to show how companies
respond and manage their communication when specific events take place, and to
assess their stakeholder&#x27;s reactions.</span>

                                        <span>Label noise and long-tailed distributions are two major challenges in
distantly supervised relation extraction. Recent studies have shown great
progress on denoising, but pay little attention to the problem of long-tailed
relations. In this paper, we introduce constraint graphs to model the
dependencies between relation labels. On top of that, we further propose a
novel constraint graph-based relation extraction framework(CGRE) to handle the
two challenges simultaneously. CGRE employs graph convolution networks (GCNs)
to propagate information from data-rich relation nodes to data-poor relation
nodes, and thus boosts the representation learning of long-tailed relations. To
further improve the noise immunity, a constraint-aware attention module is
designed in CGRE to integrate the constraint information. Experimental results
on a widely-used benchmark dataset indicate that our approach achieves
significant improvements over the previous methods for both denoising and
long-tailed relation extraction.</span>

of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). In contrast to existing work that uses
bilingual corpus as TM and employs source-side similarity search for memory
retrieval, we propose a new framework that uses monolingual memory and performs
learnable memory retrieval in a cross-lingual manner. Our framework has unique
advantages. First, the cross-lingual memory retriever allows abundant
monolingual data to be TM. Second, the memory retriever and NMT model can be
jointly optimized for the ultimate translation goal. Experiments show that the
proposed method obtains substantial improvements. Remarkably, it even
outperforms strong TM-augmented NMT baselines using bilingual TM. Owning to the
ability to leverage monolingual data, our model also demonstrates effectiveness
in low-resource and domain adaptation scenarios.</span>

text-only representation, while neglecting cell-level layout information that
is important for form image understanding. In this paper, we propose a new

with two new designs to make the most of the interactions of cell and layout
information: 1) each cell as a semantic unit; 2) classification of cell
positions. The pre-trained StructuralLM achieves new state-of-the-art results
in different types of downstream tasks, including form understanding (from
78.95 to 85.14), document visual question answering (from 72.59 to 83.94) and

research: &quot;upsampling&quot; coarse document labels to fine-grained labels or spans.
We pose the problem in a question answering format, with the answers providing
the fine-grained labels. We provide a benchmark dataset and baselines on a
socially impactful task: identifying the exact crowd size at protests and
demonstrations in the United States given only order-of-magnitude information
about protest attendance, a very small sample of fine-grained examples, and
English-language news text. We evaluate several baseline models, including
zero-shot results from rule-based and question-answering models, few-shot
models fine-tuned on a small set of documents, and weakly supervised models
using a larger set of coarsely-labeled documents. We find that our rule-based
model initially outperforms a zero-shot pre-trained transformer language model
but that further fine-tuning on a very small subset of 25 examples
substantially improves out-of-sample performance. We also demonstrate a method
for fine-tuning the transformer span on only the coarse labels that performs
similarly to our rule-based approach. This work will contribute to social

                                        <span>Contending hate speech in social media is one of the most challenging social
problems of our time. There are various types of anti-social behavior in social
media. Foremost of them is aggressive behavior, which is causing many social
issues such as affecting the social lives and mental health of social media
users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ensemble-based architecture to
automatically identify and classify aggressive tweets. Tweets are classified
into three categories - Covertly Aggressive, Overtly Aggressive, and
Non-Aggressive. The proposed architecture is an ensemble of smaller subnetworks
that are able to characterize the feature embeddings effectively. We
demonstrate qualitatively that each of the smaller subnetworks is able to learn
unique features. Our best model is an ensemble of Capsule Networks and results
in a 65.2% F1 score on the Facebook test set, which results in a performance
gain of 0.95% over the TRAC-2018 winners. The code and the model weights are

                                        <span>Cross-lingual text classification aims at training a classifier on the source
language and transferring the knowledge to target languages, which is very
useful for low-resource languages. Recent multilingual pretrained language
models (mPLM) achieve impressive results in cross-lingual classification tasks,
but rarely consider factors beyond semantic similarity, causing performance
degradation between some language pairs. In this paper we propose a simple yet
effective method to incorporate heterogeneous information within and across
languages for cross-lingual text classification using graph convolutional
networks (GCN). In particular, we construct a heterogeneous graph by treating
documents and words as nodes, and linking nodes with different relations, which
include part-of-speech roles, semantic similarity, and document translations.
Extensive experiments show that our graph-based method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on all tasks, and also achieves consistent
performance gain over baselines in low-resource settings where external tools
like translators are unavailable.</span>

Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks, but it remains unclear whether these
models truly understand language or answer questions by exploiting statistical
biases in datasets. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet effective method to
attack MRC models and reveal the statistical biases in these models. We apply
the method to the RACE dataset, for which the answer to each MRC question is
selected from 4 options. It is found that several pre-trained language models,
including BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, show consistent preference to some
options, even when these options are irrelevant to the question. When
interfered by these irrelevant options, the performance of MRC models can be
reduced from human-level performance to the chance-level performance. Human
readers, however, are not clearly affected by these irrelevant options.
Finally, we propose an augmented training method that can greatly reduce
models&#x27; statistical biases.</span>

recursively splits and rephrases complex English sentences into a semantic
hierarchy of simplified sentences. Using a set of linguistically principled
transformation patterns, input sentences are converted into a hierarchical
representation in the form of core sentences and accompanying contexts that are
linked via rhetorical relations. Hence, as opposed to previously proposed
sentence splitting approaches, which commonly do not take into account
discourse-level aspects, our TS approach preserves the semantic relationship of
the decomposed constituents in the output. A comparative analysis with the
annotations contained in the RST-DT shows that we are able to capture the
contextual hierarchy between the split sentences with a precision of 89% and
reach an average precision of 69% for the classification of the rhetorical
relations that hold between them.</span>

                                        <span>The Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is essentially a joint language
model conditioned on both the source sentence and partial translation.
Therefore, the NMT model naturally involves the mechanism of the Language Model
(LM) that predicts the next token only based on partial translation. Despite
its success, NMT still suffers from the hallucination problem, generating
fluent but inadequate translations. The main reason is that NMT pays excessive
attention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to
some extent, namely overconfidence of the LM. Accordingly, we define the Margin
between the NMT and the LM, calculated by subtracting the predicted probability
of the LM from that of the NMT model for each token. The Margin is negatively
correlated to the overconfidence degree of the LM. Based on the property, we
propose a Margin-based Token-level Objective (MTO) and a Margin-based
Sentencelevel Objective (MSO) to maximize the Margin for preventing the LM from
being overconfident. Experiments on WMT14 English-to-German, WMT19
Chinese-to-English, and WMT14 English-to-French translation tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, with 1.36, 1.50, and 0.63 BLEU improvements,
respectively, compared to the Transformer baseline. The human evaluation
further verifies that our approaches improve translation adequacy as well as
fluency.</span>

which we take as input a long text, a question, and a target answer, and the
output is a minimally modified text, so that it fits the target answer. This
task is very important in many situations, such as changing some conditions,
consequences, or properties in a legal document, or changing some key
information of an event in a news text. This is very challenging, as it is hard
to obtain a parallel corpus for training, and we need to first find all text
positions that should be changed and then decide how to change them. We
constructed the new dataset WikiBioCTE for this task based on the existing
dataset WikiBio (originally created for table-to-text generation). We use
WikiBioCTE for training, and manually labeled a test set for testing. We also
propose novel evaluation metrics and a novel method for solving the new task.
Experimental results on the test set show that our proposed method is a good
fit for this novel NLP task.</span>

the task of keyphrase generation (KG) by concatenating multiple keyphrases in a
predefined order as a target sequence during training. However, the keyphrases
are inherently an unordered set rather than an ordered sequence. Imposing a
predefined order will introduce wrong bias during training, which can highly
penalize shifts in the order between keyphrases. In this work, we propose a new
training paradigm One2Set without predefining an order to concatenate the
keyphrases. To fit this paradigm, we propose a novel model that utilizes a
fixed set of learned control codes as conditions to generate a set of
keyphrases in parallel. To solve the problem that there is no correspondence
between each prediction and target during training, we propose a $K$-step
target assignment mechanism via bipartite matching, which greatly increases the
diversity and reduces the duplication ratio of generated keyphrases. The
experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

non-abusive parts. This is due in part to the lack of datasets that explicitly
annotate heterogeneity in abusive language. We tackle this challenge by
providing an annotated dataset of abusive language in over 11,000 comments from
YouTube. We account for heterogeneity in this dataset by separately annotating
both the comment as a whole and the individual sentences that comprise each
comment. We then propose an algorithm that uses a supervised attention
mechanism to detect and categorize abusive content using multi-task learning.
We empirically demonstrate the challenges of using traditional techniques on
heterogeneous content and the comparative gains in performance of the proposed
approach over state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Despite their impressive performance in NLP, self-attention networks were
recently proved to be limited for processing formal languages with hierarchical
structure, such as $\mathsf{Dyck}_k$, the language consisting of well-nested
parentheses of $k$ types. This suggested that natural language can be
approximated well with models that are too weak for formal languages, or that
the role of hierarchy and recursion in natural language might be limited. We
qualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process
$\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, the subset of $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k}$ with depth bounded by
$D$, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of
natural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with
$D+1$ layers and $O(\log k)$ memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes
$\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, and a soft-attention network with two layers and
$O(\log k)$ memory size that generates $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$. Experiments show
that self-attention networks trained on $\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$ generalize to
longer inputs with near-perfect accuracy, and also verify the theoretical
memory advantage of self-attention networks over recurrent networks.</span>

still require labeled training data which limits this technology to a small
fraction of the languages spoken around the globe. This paper describes
wav2vec-U, short for wav2vec Unsupervised, a method to train speech recognition
models without any labeled data. We leverage self-supervised speech
representations to segment unlabeled audio and learn a mapping from these
representations to phonemes via adversarial training. The right representations
are key to the success of our method. Compared to the best previous
unsupervised work, wav2vec-U reduces the phoneme error rate on the TIMIT
benchmark from 26.1 to 11.3. On the larger English Librispeech benchmark,
wav2vec-U achieves a word error rate of 5.9 on test-other, rivaling some of the
best published systems trained on 960 hours of labeled data from only two years
ago. We also experiment on nine other languages, including low-resource

revolutionized the predictive performance of various modern natural language
processing tasks. This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a
service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as commercial
APIs. However, previous works have discovered a series of vulnerabilities in
BERT- based APIs. For example, BERT-based APIs are vulnerable to both model
extraction attack and adversarial example transferrability attack. However, due
to the high capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be
overlearned, what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model
remains unknown and is lacking. To bridge this gap, in this work, we first
present an effective model extraction attack, where the adversary can
practically steal a BERT-based API (the target/victim model) by only querying a
limited number of queries. We further develop an effective attribute inference
attack to expose the sensitive attribute of the training data used by the
BERT-based APIs. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various
realistic settings demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities of BERT-based
APIs.</span>

users to share their user-generated content. This publicly-generated user data
is also crucial to healthcare technologies because the discovered patterns
would hugely benefit them in several ways. One of the applications is in
automatically discovering mental health problems, e.g., depression. Previous
studies to automatically detect a depressed user on online social media have
largely relied upon the user behaviour and their linguistic patterns including
user&#x27;s social interactions. The downside is that these models are trained on
several irrelevant content which might not be crucial towards detecting a
depressed user. Besides, these content have a negative impact on the overall
efficiency and effectiveness of the model. To overcome the shortcomings in the
existing automatic depression detection methods, we propose a novel
computational framework for automatic depression detection that initially
selects relevant content through a hybrid extractive and abstractive
summarization strategy on the sequence of all user tweets leading to a more
fine-grained and relevant content. The content then goes to our novel deep
learning framework comprising of a unified learning machinery comprising of
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled with attention-enhanced Gated

specific and diverse. However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require
expensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a
few fields. At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential
training signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled
datasets. Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection
in English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an
external source. To accomplish this, we introduce CiteWorth, a large,
contextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness
detection built from a massive corpus of extracted plain-text scientific
documents. We show that CiteWorth is high-quality, challenging, and suitable
for studying problems such as domain adaptation. Our best performing
cite-worthiness detection model is a paragraph-level contextualized sentence
labelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over
SciBERT which considers only individual sentences. Finally, we demonstrate that
language model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to
improved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.</span>

outperform the others when evaluated by human annotators as well as on an

generalise, in capturing knowledge about unseen products. Finally, we consider

discourse parsing in the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework. In this
formulation, we consider discourse parsing as a sequence of splitting decisions
at token boundaries and use a seq2seq network to model the splitting decisions.
Our framework facilitates discourse parsing from scratch without requiring
discourse segmentation as a prerequisite; rather, it yields segmentation as
part of the parsing process. Our unified parsing model adopts a beam search to
decode the best tree structure by searching through a space of high-scoring
trees. With extensive experiments on the standard English RST discourse
treebank, we demonstrate that our parser outperforms existing methods by a good
margin in both end-to-end parsing and parsing with gold segmentation. More
importantly, it does so without using any handcrafted features, making it
faster and easily adaptable to new languages and domains.</span>

                                        <span>Interactive single-image segmentation is ubiquitous in the scientific and
commercial imaging software. In this work, we focus on the single-image
segmentation problem only with some seeds such as scribbles. Inspired by the
dynamic receptive field in the human being&#x27;s visual system, we propose the
Gaussian dynamic convolution (GDC) to fast and efficiently aggregate the
contextual information for neural networks. The core idea is randomly selecting
the spatial sampling area according to the Gaussian distribution offsets. Our
GDC can be easily used as a module to build lightweight or complex segmentation
networks. We adopt the proposed GDC to address the typical single-image
segmentation tasks. Furthermore, we also build a Gaussian dynamic pyramid
Pooling to show its potential and generality in common semantic segmentation.
Experiments demonstrate that the GDC outperforms other existing convolutions on
three benchmark segmentation datasets including Pascal-Context, Pascal-VOC
2012, and Cityscapes. Additional experiments are also conducted to illustrate
that the GDC can produce richer and more vivid features compared with other
convolutions. In general, our GDC is conducive to the convolutional neural
networks to form an overall impression of the image.</span>

                                        <span>Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have been widely used in a variety of
applications thanks to the rich spectral information they are able to provide.
Among all HSI processing tasks, HSI denoising is a crucial step. Recently, deep
learning-based image denoising methods have made great progress and achieved
great performance. However, existing methods tend to ignore the correlations
between adjacent spectral bands, leading to problems such as spectral
distortion and blurred edges in denoised results. In this study, we propose a
novel HSI denoising network, termed SSCAN, that combines group convolutions and
attention modules. Specifically, we use a group convolution with a spatial
attention module to facilitate feature extraction by directing models&#x27;
attention to band-wise important features. We propose a spectral-spatial
attention block (SSAB) to exploit the spatial and spectral information in
hyperspectral images in an effective manner. In addition, we adopt residual
learning operations with skip connections to ensure training stability. The
experimental results indicate that the proposed SSCAN outperforms several
state-of-the-art HSI denoising algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Tuberculosis is a contagious disease which is one of the leading causes of
death, globally. The general diagnosis methods for tuberculosis include
microscopic examination, tuberculin skin test, culture method, enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electronic nose system. World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends standard microscopic examination for early
diagnosis of tuberculosis. In microscopy, the technician examines field of
views (FOVs) in sputum smear for presence of any TB bacilli and counts the
number of TB bacilli per FOV to report the level of severity. This process is
time consuming with an increased concentration for an experienced staff to
examine a single sputum smear. The examination demands for skilled technicians
in high-prevalence countries which may lead to overload, fatigue and diminishes
the quality of microscopy. Thus, a computer assisted system is proposed and
designed for the detection of tuberculosis bacilli to assist pathologists with
increased sensitivity and specificity. The manual efforts in detecting and
counting the number of TB bacilli is greatly minimized. The system obtains
Ziehl-Neelsen stained microscopic images from conventional microscope at 100x
magnification and passes the data to the detection system. Initially the
segmentation of TB bacilli was done using RGB thresholding and Sauvola&#x27;s
adaptive thresholding algorithm. To eliminate the non-TB bacilli from coarse
level segmentation, shape descriptors like area, perimeter, convex hull, major
axis length and eccentricity are used to extract only the TB bacilli features.
Finally, the TB bacilli are counted using the generated bounding boxes to
report the level of severity.</span>

largest cause of death worldwide. Fast and precise stroke lesion detection and
location is an extreme important process with regards to stroke diagnosis,

operation, hybrid system management or energy trading, could benefit from
improved short-term solar forecasting, addressing the intermittent energy
production from solar panels. However, current approaches to modelling the
cloud cover dynamics from sky images still lack precision regarding the spatial
configuration of clouds, their temporal dynamics and physical interactions with
solar radiation. Benefiting from a growing number of large datasets, data
driven methods are being developed to address these limitations with promising
results. In this study, we compare four commonly used Deep Learning
architectures trained to forecast solar irradiance from sequences of
hemispherical sky images and exogenous variables. To assess the relative
performance of each model, we used the Forecast Skill metric based on the smart
persistence model, as well as ramp and time distortion metrics. The results
show that encoding spatiotemporal aspects of the sequence of sky images greatly
improved the predictions with 10 min ahead Forecast Skill reaching 20.4% on the
test year. However, based on the experimental data, we conclude that, with a
common setup, Deep Learning models tend to behave just as a &#x27;very smart
persistence model&#x27;, temporally aligned with the persistence model while
mitigating its most penalising errors. Thus, despite being captured by the sky
cameras, models often miss fundamental events causing large irradiance changes
such as clouds obscuring the sun. We hope that our work will contribute to a
shift of this approach to irradiance forecasting, from reactive to
anticipatory.</span>

This is a global health problem that requires a global solution. The MICCAI
challenge discussed in this paper, which concerns the automated detection of
diabetic foot ulcers using machine learning techniques, will accelerate the
development of innovative healthcare technology to address this unmet medical
need. In an effort to improve patient care and reduce the strain on healthcare
systems, recent research has focused on the creation of cloud-based detection
algorithms. These can be consumed as a service by a mobile app that patients
(or a carer, partner or family member) could use themselves at home to monitor
their condition and to detect the appearance of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU).
Collaborative work between Manchester Metropolitan University, Lancashire
Teaching Hospital and the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust has
created a repository of 4,000 DFU images for the purpose of supporting research
toward more advanced methods of DFU detection. Based on a joint effort
involving the lead scientists of the UK, US, India and New Zealand, this
challenge will solicit original work, and promote interactions between
researchers and interdisciplinary collaborations. This paper presents a dataset
description and analysis, assessment methods, benchmark algorithms and initial
evaluation results. It facilitates the challenge by providing useful insights

across people, and thus can be treated as an intrinsic property of an image.
Using computer vision models, we can make specific predictions about what
people will remember or forget. While older work has used now-outdated deep
learning architectures to predict image memorability, innovations in the field
have given us new techniques to apply to this problem. Here, we propose and
evaluate five alternative deep learning models which exploit developments in
the field from the last five years, largely the introduction of residual neural
networks, which are intended to allow the model to use semantic information in
the memorability estimation process. These new models were tested against the
prior state of the art with a combined dataset built to optimize both
within-category and across-category predictions. Our findings suggest that the
key prior memorability network had overstated its generalizability and was
overfit on its training set. Our new models outperform this prior model,
leading us to conclude that Residual Networks outperform simpler convolutional
neural networks in memorability regression. We make our new state-of-the-art
model readily available to the research community, allowing memory researchers
to make predictions about memorability on a wider range of images.</span>

                                        <span>Quantization is a technique used in deep neural networks (DNNs) to increase
execution performance and hardware efficiency. Uniform post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented
efficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a
training set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with
negligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with
PTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the
increase in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware
quantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation
sparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit
quantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of
8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value
bits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we
focus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal
to zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the
other&#x27;s 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically
quantized to 4 bits, as described. SPARQ achieves minor accuracy degradation,
2x speedup over widely used hardware architectures, and a practical hardware
implementation. The code is available at https://github.com/gilshm/sparq.</span>

such as human pose estimation, its use for RGB human action recognition is
relatively unexplored. Our goal in this work is to answer the question whether
synthetic humans can improve the performance of human action recognition, with
a particular focus on generalization to unseen viewpoints. We make use of the
recent advances in monocular 3D human body reconstruction from real action
sequences to automatically render synthetic training videos for the action
labels. We make the following contributions: (i) we investigate the extent of
variations and augmentations that are beneficial to improving performance at
new viewpoints. We consider changes in body shape and clothing for individuals,
as well as more action relevant augmentations such as non-uniform frame
sampling, and interpolating between the motion of individuals performing the
same action; (ii) We introduce a new data generation methodology, SURREACT,
that allows training of spatio-temporal CNNs for action classification; (iii)
We substantially improve the state-of-the-art action recognition performance on
the NTU RGB+D and UESTC standard human action multi-view benchmarks; Finally,
(iv) we extend the augmentation approach to in-the-wild videos from a subset of
the Kinetics dataset to investigate the case when only one-shot training data
is available, and demonstrate improvements in this case as well.</span>

moving in front of a textured background. It is a particular variation of
multibody structure from motion, which specializes to two objects only. The
scene is captured in several static configurations between which the relative
pose of the two objects may change. We reconstruct every static configuration
individually and segment the points locally by finding multiple poses of
cameras that capture the scene&#x27;s other configurations. Then, the local
segmentation results are combined, and the reconstructions are merged into the
resulting model of the scene. In experiments with real artifacts, we show that
our approach has practical advantages when reconstructing 3D objects from all

                                        <span>SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus, is a viral contagious
disease that is infected by a novel coronavirus, and has been rapidly spreading
across the globe. It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce
spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently.
According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is
the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer
vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can
predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The
accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such
as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of
data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease
is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the
available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by
utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and
negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded
that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19
positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based
classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater
accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>In anomaly detection (AD), one seeks to identify whether a test sample is
abnormal, given a data set of normal samples. A recent and promising approach
to AD relies on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders
(VAEs), for unsupervised learning of the normal data distribution. In
semi-supervised AD (SSAD), the data also includes a small sample of labeled
anomalies. In this work, we propose two variational methods for training VAEs
for SSAD. The intuitive idea in both methods is to train the encoder to
&#x60;separate&#x27; between latent vectors for normal and outlier data. We show that
this idea can be derived from principled probabilistic formulations of the
problem, and propose simple and effective algorithms. Our methods can be
applied to various data types, as we demonstrate on SSAD datasets ranging from
natural images to astronomy and medicine, can be combined with any VAE model
architecture, and are naturally compatible with ensembling. When comparing to
state-of-the-art SSAD methods that are not specific to particular data types,
we obtain marked improvement in outlier detection.</span>

people and caused approximately 3.17 million deaths around the world up to the
present. The rapid spread of COVID-19 is continuing to threaten human&#x27;s life
and health. Therefore, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD)
systems based on machine and deep learning methods which are able to accurately
differentiate COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT)
and X-Ray datasets is essential and of immediate priority. Different from most
of the previous studies which used either one of CT or X-ray images, we
employed both data types with sufficient samples in implementation. On the
other hand, due to the extreme sensitivity of this pervasive virus, model
uncertainty should be considered, while most previous studies have overlooked
it. Therefore, we propose a novel powerful fusion model named
$UncertaintyFuseNet$ that consists of an uncertainty module: Ensemble Monte
Carlo (EMC) dropout. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of our
proposed fusion for COVID-19 detection using CT scan and X-Ray datasets. Also,
our proposed $UncertaintyFuseNet$ model is significantly robust to noise and
performs well with the previously unseen data. The source codes and models of
this study are available at:

architectures, various applications of such models have been proposed over
time. In the field of anomaly detection, improvements in deep learning opened
new prospects of exploration for the researchers whom tried to automate the
labor-intensive features of data collection. First, in terms of data
collection, it is impossible to anticipate all the anomalies that might exist
in a given environment. Second, assuming we limit the possibilities of
anomalies, it will still be hard to record all these scenarios for the sake of
training a model. Third, even if we manage to record a significant amount of
abnormal data, it&#x27;s laborious to annotate this data on pixel or even frame
level. Various approaches address the problem by proposing one-class
classification using generative models trained on only normal data. In such
methods, only the normal data is used, which is abundantly available and
doesn&#x27;t require significant human input. However, these are trained with only
normal data and at the test time, given abnormal data as input, may often
generate normal-looking output. This happens due to the hallucination
characteristic of generative models. Next, these systems are designed to not
use abnormal examples during the training. In this paper, we propose anomaly
detection with negative learning (ADNL), which employs the negative learning
concept for the enhancement of anomaly detection by utilizing a very small
number of labeled anomaly data as compared with the normal data during
training. The idea is to limit the reconstruction capability of a generative
model using the given a small amount of anomaly examples. This way, the network
not only learns to reconstruct normal data but also encloses the normal
distribution far from the possible distribution of anomalies.</span>

applications such as graph classification and segmentation. However, current
GCNs have limitations on implementation such as network architectures due to
their irregular inputs. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
capable of extracting rich features from large-scale input data, but they do
not support general graph inputs. To bridge the gap between GCNs and CNNs, in
this paper we study the problem of how to effectively and efficiently map
general graphs to 2D grids that CNNs can be directly applied to, while
preserving graph topology as much as possible. We therefore propose two novel
graph-to-grid mapping schemes, namely, {\em graph-preserving grid layout
(GPGL)} and its extension {\em Hierarchical GPGL (H-GPGL)} for computational
efficiency. We formulate the GPGL problem as integer programming and further
propose an approximate yet efficient solver based on a penalized Kamada-Kawai
method, a well-known optimization algorithm in 2D graph drawing. We propose a
novel vertex separation penalty that encourages graph vertices to lay on the
grid without any overlap. Along with this image representation, even extra 2D
maxpooling layers contribute to the PointNet, a widely applied point-based
neural network. We demonstrate the empirical success of GPGL on general graph
classification with small graphs and H-GPGL on 3D point cloud segmentation with
large graphs, based on 2D CNNs including VGG16, ResNet50 and multi-scale maxout
(MSM) CNN.</span>

network for hand-held multi-frame high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, namely
ADNet. This problem comprises two intractable challenges of how to handle
saturation and noise properly and how to tackle misalignments caused by object
motion or camera jittering. To address the former, we adopt a spatial attention
module to adaptively select the most appropriate regions of various exposure
low dynamic range (LDR) images for fusion. For the latter one, we propose to
align the gamma-corrected images in the feature-level with a Pyramid, Cascading
and Deformable (PCD) alignment module. The proposed ADNet shows
state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods, achieving a
PSNR-$l$ of 39.4471 and a PSNR-$\mu$ of 37.6359 in NTIRE 2021 Multi-Frame HDR

                                        <span>Noisy neural networks (NoisyNNs) refer to the inference and training of NNs
in the presence of noise. Noise is inherent in most communication and storage
systems; hence, NoisyNNs emerge in many new applications, including federated
edge learning, where wireless devices collaboratively train a NN over a noisy
wireless channel, or when NNs are implemented/stored in an analog storage
medium. This paper studies a fundamental problem of NoisyNNs: how to estimate
the uncontaminated NN weights from their noisy observations or manifestations.
Whereas all prior works relied on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to
maximize the likelihood function of the estimated NN weights, this paper
demonstrates that the ML estimator is in general suboptimal. To overcome the
suboptimality of the conventional ML estimator, we put forth an
$\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator to minimize a compensated mean squared error (MSE)
with a population compensator and a bias compensator. Our approach works well
for NoisyNNs arising in both 1) noisy inference, where noise is introduced only
in the inference phase on the already-trained NN weights; and 2) noisy
training, where noise is introduced over the course of training. Extensive
experiments on the CIFAR-10 and SST-2 datasets with different NN architectures
verify the significant performance gains of the $\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator
over the ML estimator when used to denoise the NoisyNN. For noisy inference,
the average gains are up to $156\%$ for a noisy ResNet34 model and $14.7\%$ for
a noisy BERT model; for noisy training, the average gains are up to $18.1$ dB
for a noisy ResNet18 model.</span>

                                        <span>Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing and
is at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications,
neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view
synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental
obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and
memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the
rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring
hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate
those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic
integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to
integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate
the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The
graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble
the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the
fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite
integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural
rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality:
improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly
reduced image quality.</span>

increasingly popular in recent years. The goal of multimodal deep learning is
to create models that can process and link information using various
modalities. Despite the extensive development made for unimodal learning, it
still cannot cover all the aspects of human learning. Multimodal learning helps
to understand and analyze better when various senses are engaged in the
processing of information. This paper focuses on multiple types of modalities,
i.e., image, video, text, audio, body gestures, facial expressions, and
physiological signals. Detailed analysis of past and current baseline
approaches and an in-depth study of recent advancements in multimodal deep
learning applications has been provided. A fine-grained taxonomy of various
multimodal deep learning applications is proposed, elaborating on different
applications in more depth. Architectures and datasets used in these
applications are also discussed, along with their evaluation metrics. Last,

temporal video segmentation. TCNs however, tend to suffer from
over-segmentation errors and require additional refinement modules to ensure
smoothness and temporal coherency. In this work, we propose a novel temporal
encoder-decoder to tackle the problem of sequence fragmentation. In particular,
the decoder follows a coarse-to-fine structure with an implicit ensemble of
multiple temporal resolutions. The ensembling produces smoother segmentations
that are more accurate and better-calibrated, bypassing the need for additional
refinement modules. In addition, we enhance our training with a
multi-resolution feature-augmentation strategy to promote robustness to varying
temporal resolutions. Finally, to support our architecture and encourage
further sequence coherency, we propose an action loss that penalizes
misclassifications at the video level. Experiments show that our stand-alone
architecture, together with our novel feature-augmentation strategy and new
loss, outperforms the state-of-the-art on three temporal video segmentation
benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Change detection is the process of identifying pixel-wise differences of
bi-temporal co-registered images. It is of great significance to Earth
observation. Recently, with the emerging of deep learning (DL), deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods have shown their power and
feasibility in the field of change detection. However, there is still a lack of
effective supervision for change feature learning. In this work, a feature
constraint change detection network (FCCDN) is proposed. We constrain features
both on bi-temporal feature extraction and feature fusion. More specifically,
we propose a dual encoder-decoder network backbone for the change detection
task. At the center of the backbone, we design a non-local feature pyramid
network to extract and fuse multi-scale features. To fuse bi-temporal features
in a robust way, we build a dense connection-based feature fusion module.
Moreover, a self-supervised learning-based strategy is proposed to constrain
feature learning. Based on FCCDN, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on
two building change detection datasets (LEVIR-CD and WHU). On the LEVIR-CD
dataset, we achieve IoU of 0.8569 and F1 score of 0.9229. On the WHU dataset,
we achieve IoU of 0.8820 and F1 score of 0.9373. Moreover, we, for the first
time, achieve the acquire of accurate bi-temporal semantic segmentation results
without using semantic segmentation labels. It is vital for the application of
change detection because it saves the cost of labeling.</span>

in annotating training data through business process outsourcing companies and
crowdsourcing platforms. Many data annotators are situated in the Global South
and are considered independent contractors. This paper focuses on the
experiences of Argentinian and Venezuelan annotation workers. Through
qualitative methods, we explore the discourses encoded in the task instructions
that these workers follow to annotate computer vision datasets. Our preliminary
findings indicate that annotation instructions reflect worldviews imposed on
workers and, through their labor, on datasets. Moreover, we observe that
for-profit goals drive task instructions and that managers and algorithms make
sure annotations are done according to requesters&#x27; commands. This configuration
presents a form of commodified labor that perpetuates power asymmetries while
reinforcing social inequalities and is compelled to reproduce them into
datasets and, subsequently, in computer vision systems.</span>

                                        <span>One of the most fundamental and information-laden actions humans do is to
look at objects. However, a survey of current works reveals that existing
gaze-related datasets annotate only the pixel being looked at, and not the
boundaries of a specific object of interest. This lack of object annotation
presents an opportunity for further advancing gaze estimation research. To this
end, we present a challenging new task called gaze object prediction, where the
goal is to predict a bounding box for a person&#x27;s gazed-at object. To train and
evaluate gaze networks on this task, we present the Gaze On Objects (GOO)
dataset. GOO is composed of a large set of synthetic images (GOO Synth)
supplemented by a smaller subset of real images (GOO-Real) of people looking at
objects in a retail environment. Our work establishes extensive baselines on
GOO by re-implementing and evaluating selected state-of-the art models on the
task of gaze following and domain adaptation. Code is available on github.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the astonishing performance of deep-learning based approaches for
visual tasks such as semantic segmentation, they are known to produce
miscalibrated predictions, which could be harmful for critical decision-making
processes. Ensemble learning has shown to not only boost the performance of
individual models but also reduce their miscalibration by averaging independent
predictions. In this scenario, model diversity has become a key factor, which
facilitates individual models converging to different functional solutions. In
this work, we introduce Orthogonal Ensemble Networks (OEN), a novel framework
to explicitly enforce model diversity by means of orthogonal constraints. The
proposed method is based on the hypothesis that inducing orthogonality among
the constituents of the ensemble will increase the overall model diversity. We
resort to a new pairwise orthogonality constraint which can be used to
regularize a sequential ensemble training process, resulting on improved
predictive performance and better calibrated model outputs. We benchmark the
proposed framework in two challenging brain lesion segmentation tasks --brain
tumor and white matter hyper-intensity segmentation in MR images. The
experimental results show that our approach produces more robust and
well-calibrated ensemble models and can deal with challenging tasks in the
context of biomedical image segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks trained on real-world datasets with long-tailed label
distributions are biased towards frequent classes and perform poorly on
infrequent classes. The imbalance in the ratio of positive and negative samples
for each class skews network output probabilities further from ground-truth
distributions. We propose a method, Partial Label Masking (PLM), which utilizes
this ratio during training. By stochastically masking labels during loss
computation, the method balances this ratio for each class, leading to improved
recall on minority classes and improved precision on frequent classes. The
ratio is estimated adaptively based on the network&#x27;s performance by minimizing
the KL divergence between predicted and ground-truth distributions. Whereas
most existing approaches addressing data imbalance are mainly focused on
single-label classification and do not generalize well to the multi-label case,
this work proposes a general approach to solve the long-tail data imbalance
issue for multi-label classification. PLM is versatile: it can be applied to
most objective functions and it can be used alongside other strategies for
class imbalance. Our method achieves strong performance when compared to
existing methods on both multi-label (MultiMNIST and MSCOCO) and single-label
(imbalanced CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) image classification datasets.</span>

discriminative and generative learning at a latent space level for
semi-supervised few-shot classification. Various tasks for classifying new
species from image data can be modeled as a semi-supervised few-shot
classification, which assumes a labeled and unlabeled training examples and a
small support set of the target classes. Predicting target classes with a few
support examples per class makes the learning task difficult for existing
semi-supervised classification methods, including selftraining, which
iteratively estimates class labels of unlabeled training examples to learn a
classifier for the training classes. To exploit unlabeled training examples
effectively, we adopt as the objective function the composite likelihood, which
integrates discriminative and generative learning and suits better with deep
neural networks than the parameter coupling prior, the other popular integrated
learning approach. In our proposed model, the discriminative and generative
models are respectively Prototypical Networks, which have shown excellent
performance in various kinds of few-shot learning, and Normalizing Flow a deep
invertible model which returns the exact marginal likelihood unlike the other
three major methods, i.e., VAE, GAN, and autoregressive model. Our main
originality lies in our integration of these components at a latent space
level, which is effective in preventing overfitting. Experiments using
mini-ImageNet and VGG-Face datasets show that our method outperforms
selftraining based Prototypical Networks.</span>

3D shape represented as a point cloud into primitive patches. The key to deep
primitive segmentation is learning a feature representation that can separate
points of different primitives. Unlike utilizing a single feature
representation, HPNet leverages hybrid representations that combine one learned
semantic descriptor, two spectral descriptors derived from predicted geometric
parameters, as well as an adjacency matrix that encodes sharp edges. Moreover,
instead of merely concatenating the descriptors, HPNet optimally combines
hybrid representations by learning combination weights. This weighting module
builds on the entropy of input features. The output primitive segmentation is
obtained from a mean-shift clustering module. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets ANSI and ABCParts show that HPNet leads to significant performance
gains from baseline approaches.</span>

post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome prediction based on pre-radiation images
and radiotherapy dose information. Based on the classic reaction-diffusion
mechanism, a novel biological model was proposed using a partial differential
equation that incorporates spatial radiation dose distribution as a
patient-specific treatment information variable. A 7-layer
encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and
trained to learn the proposed biological model. As such, the model could
generate post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome predictions with possible
time-series transition from pre-radiotherapy image states to post-radiotherapy
states. The proposed method was developed using 64 oropharyngeal patients with
paired FDG-PET studies before and after 20Gy delivery (2Gy/daily fraction) by
IMRT. In a two-branch deep learning execution, the proposed CNN learns specific
terms in the biological model from paired FDG-PET images and spatial dose
distribution as in one branch, and the biological model generates post-20Gy
FDG-PET image prediction in the other branch. The proposed method successfully
generated post-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome prediction with breakdown
illustrations of biological model components. Time-series FDG-PET image
predictions were generated to demonstrate the feasibility of disease response
rendering. The developed biologically guided deep learning method achieved
post-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome predictions in good agreement with ground-truth
results. With break-down biological modeling components, the outcome image
predictions could be used in adaptive radiotherapy decision-making to optimize
personalized plans for the best outcome in the future.</span>

                                        <span>The ultimate goal for an inference model is to be robust and functional in
real life applications. However, training vs. test data domain gaps often
negatively affect model performance. This issue is especially critical for the
monocular 3D human pose estimation problem, in which 3D human data is often
collected in a controlled lab setting. In this paper, we focus on alleviating
the negative effect of domain shift by presenting our adapted human pose (AHuP)
approach that addresses adaptation problems in both appearance and pose spaces.
AHuP is built around a practical assumption that in real applications, data
from target domain could be inaccessible or only limited information can be
acquired. We illustrate the 3D pose estimation performance of AHuP in two
scenarios. First, when source and target data differ significantly in both
appearance and pose spaces, in which we learn from synthetic 3D human data
(with zero real 3D human data) and show comparable performance with the
state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation models that have full access to the real 3D
human pose benchmarks for training. Second, when source and target datasets
differ mainly in the pose space, in which AHuP approach can be applied to
further improve the performance of the state-of-the-art models when tested on
the datasets different from their training dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching the video
tracklets with cropped video frames for identifying the pedestrians under
different cameras. However, there exists severe spatial and temporal
misalignment for those cropped tracklets due to the imperfect detection and
tracking results generated with obsolete methods. To address this issue, we
present a simple re-Detect and Link (DL) module which can effectively reduce
those unexpected noise through applying the deep learning-based detection and
tracking on the cropped tracklets. Furthermore, we introduce an improved model
called Coarse-to-Fine Axial-Attention Network (CF-AAN). Based on the typical
Non-local Network, we replace the non-local module with three 1-D
position-sensitive axial attentions, in addition to our proposed coarse-to-fine
structure. With the developed CF-AAN, compared to the original non-local
operation, we can not only significantly reduce the computation cost but also
obtain the state-of-the-art performance (91.3% in rank-1 and 86.5% in mAP) on
the large-scale MARS dataset. Meanwhile, by simply adopting our DL module for
data alignment, to our surprise, several baseline models can achieve better or
comparable results with the current state-of-the-arts. Besides, we discover the
errors not only for the identity labels of tracklets but also for the
evaluation protocol for the test data of MARS. We hope that our work can help
the community for the further development of invariant representation without
the hassle of the spatial and temporal alignment and dataset noise. The code,
corrected labels, evaluation protocol, and the aligned data will be available
at https://github.com/jackie840129/CF-AAN.</span>

                                        <span>Significant progress on the crowd counting problem has been achieved by
integrating larger context into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This
indicates that global scene context is essential, despite the seemingly
bottom-up nature of the problem. This may be explained by the fact that context
knowledge can adapt and improve local feature extraction to a given scene. In
this paper, we therefore investigate the role of global context for crowd
counting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with
global information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification,
we add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information
exchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer
layers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the
tried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module
(TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed
by the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person
count of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
datasets, including ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++ and NWPU. On the
large-scale JHU-CROWD++ dataset, our method improves over the previous best
results by 26.9% and 29.9% in terms of MAE and MSE, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Although monocular 3D human pose estimation methods have made significant
progress, it&#x27;s far from being solved due to the inherent depth ambiguity.
Instead, exploiting multi-view information is a practical way to achieve
absolute 3D human pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective pipeline for weakly-supervised cross-view 3D human pose estimation.
By only using two camera views, our method can achieve state-of-the-art
performance in a weakly-supervised manner, requiring no 3D ground truth but
only 2D annotations. Specifically, our method contains two steps: triangulation
and refinement. First, given the 2D keypoints that can be obtained through any
classic 2D detection methods, triangulation is performed across two views to
lift the 2D keypoints into coarse 3D poses.Then, a novel cross-view U-shaped
graph convolutional network (CV-UGCN), which can explore the spatial
configurations and cross-view correlations, is designed to refine the coarse 3D
poses. In particular, the refinement progress is achieved through
weakly-supervised learning, in which geometric and structure-aware consistency
checks are performed. We evaluate our method on the standard benchmark dataset,
Human3.6M. The Mean Per Joint Position Error on the benchmark dataset is 27.4
mm, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts remarkably (27.4 mm vs 30.2 mm).</span>

                                        <span>Terrain traversability analysis plays a major role in ensuring safe robotic
navigation in unstructured environments. However, real-time constraints
frequently limit the accuracy of online tests, especially in scenarios where
realistic robot-terrain interactions are complex to model. In this context, we
propose a deep learning framework, trained in an end-to-end fashion from
elevation maps and trajectories, to estimate the occurrence of failure events.
The network is first trained and tested in simulation over synthetic maps
generated by the OpenSimplex algorithm. The prediction performance of the Deep
Learning framework is illustrated by being able to retain over 94% recall of
the original simulator at 30% of the computational time. Finally, the network
is transferred and tested on real elevation maps collected by the SEEKER
consortium during the Martian rover test trial in the Atacama desert in Chile.
We show that transferring and fine-tuning of an application-independent
pre-trained model retains better performance than training uniquely on scarcely
available real data.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, DETR and Deformable DETR have been proposed to eliminate the need
for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good
performance as previous complex hand-crafted detectors. However, their
performance on Video Object Detection (VOD) has not been well explored. In this
paper, we present TransVOD, an end-to-end video object detection model based on
a spatial-temporal Transformer architecture. The goal of this paper is to
streamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing the need for many
hand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow, recurrent
neural networks, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query
design in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods
such as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and
clean. In particular, we present temporal Transformer to aggregate both the
spatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame. Our temporal
Transformer consists of three components: Temporal Deformable Transformer
Encoder (TDTE) to encode the multiple frame spatial details, Temporal Query
Encoder (TQE) to fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer
Decoder to obtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the
strong baseline deformable DETR by a significant margin (3%-4% mAP) on the
ImageNet VID dataset. TransVOD yields comparable results performance on the
benchmark of ImageNet VID. We hope our TransVOD can provide a new perspective
for video object detection. Code will be made publicly available at

from a single resolution, which is not suitable for different hand sizes. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new deep learning-based framework that
consists of two main modules. The former presents a segmentation-based approach
to detect the hand skeleton and localize the hand bounding box. The second
module regresses the 2D joint locations through a multi-scale heatmap
regression approach that exploits the predicted hand skeleton as a constraint
to guide the model. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset that is suitable
for both hand detection and pose estimation. We qualitatively and
quantitatively validate our method on two datasets. Results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art and can recover the pose even

of individual attribute and object predictions, especially in the case of
unseen attribute-object pairs.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, satellites with high temporal resolution have fostered wide
attention in various practical applications. Due to limitations of bandwidth
and hardware cost, however, the spatial resolution of such satellites is
considerably low, largely limiting their potentials in scenarios that require
spatially explicit information. To improve image resolution, numerous
approaches based on training low-high resolution pairs have been proposed to
address the super-resolution (SR) task. Despite their success, however,
low/high spatial resolution pairs are usually difficult to obtain in satellites
with a high temporal resolution, making such approaches in SR impractical to
use. In this paper, we proposed a new unsupervised learning framework, called
&quot;MIP&quot;, which achieves SR tasks without low/high resolution image pairs. First,
random noise maps are fed into a designed generative adversarial network (GAN)
for reconstruction. Then, the proposed method converts the reference image to
latent space as the migration image prior. Finally, we update the input noise
via an implicit method, and further transfer the texture and structured
information from the reference image. Extensive experimental results on the
Draper dataset show that MIP achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed
MIP is open-sourced at this http URL</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we tackle the problem of convolutional neural network design.
Instead of focusing on the design of the overall architecture, we investigate a
design space that is usually overlooked, i.e. adjusting the channel
configurations of predefined networks. We find that this adjustment can be
achieved by shrinking widened baseline networks and leads to superior
performance. Based on that, we articulate the heterogeneity hypothesis: with
the same training protocol, there exists a layer-wise differentiated network
architecture (LW-DNA) that can outperform the original network with regular
channel configurations but with a lower level of model complexity.

The LW-DNA models are identified without extra computational cost or training
time compared with the original network. This constraint leads to controlled
experiments which direct the focus to the importance of layer-wise specific
channel configurations. LW-DNA models come with advantages related to
overfitting, i.e. the relative relationship between model complexity and
dataset size. Experiments are conducted on various networks and datasets for
image classification, visual tracking and image restoration. The resultant
LW-DNA models consistently outperform the baseline models. Code is available at

                                        <span>D shape generation is a fundamental operation in computer graphics. While
significant progress has been made, especially with recent deep generative
models, it remains a challenge to synthesize high-quality shapes with rich
geometric details and complex structure, in a controllable manner. To tackle
this, we introduce DSG-Net, a deep neural network that learns a disentangled
structured and geometric mesh representation for 3D shapes, where two key
aspects of shapes, geometry, and structure, are encoded in a synergistic manner
to ensure plausibility of the generated shapes, while also being disentangled
as much as possible. This supports a range of novel shape generation
applications with disentangled control, such as interpolation of structure
(geometry) while keeping geometry (structure) unchanged. To achieve this, we
simultaneously learn structure and geometry through variational autoencoders
(VAEs) in a hierarchical manner for both, with bijective mappings at each
level. In this manner, we effectively encode geometry and structure in separate
latent spaces, while ensuring their compatibility: the structure is used to
guide the geometry and vice versa. At the leaf level, the part geometry is
represented using a conditional part VAE, to encode high-quality geometric
details, guided by the structure context as the condition. Our method not only
supports controllable generation applications but also produces high-quality
synthesized shapes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The code has been
released at https://github.com/IGLICT/DSG-Net.</span>

basis for rigged garments through deep learning. Classical approaches rely on
Physically Based Simulations (PBS) to animate clothes. These are general
solutions that, given a sufficiently fine-grained discretization of space and
time, can achieve highly realistic results. However, they are computationally
expensive and any scene modification prompts the need of re-simulation. Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS) with PSD offers a lightweight alternative to PBS, though,
it needs huge volumes of data to learn proper PSD. We propose using deep
learning, formulated as an implicit PBS, to unsupervisedly learn realistic
cloth Pose Space Deformations in a constrained scenario: dressed humans.
Furthermore, we show it is possible to train these models in an amount of time
comparable to a PBS of a few sequences. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to propose a neural simulator for cloth. While deep-based approaches
in the domain are becoming a trend, these are data-hungry models. Moreover,
authors often propose complex formulations to better learn wrinkles from PBS
data. Supervised learning leads to physically inconsistent predictions that
require collision solving to be used. Also, dependency on PBS data limits the
scalability of these solutions, while their formulation hinders its
applicability and compatibility. By proposing an unsupervised methodology to
learn PSD for LBS models (3D animation standard), we overcome both of these
drawbacks. Results obtained show cloth-consistency in the animated garments and
meaningful pose-dependant folds and wrinkles. Our solution is extremely
efficient, handles multiple layers of cloth, allows unsupervised outfit
resizing and can be easily applied to any custom 3D avatar.</span>

                                        <span>Choosing a decision threshold is one of the challenging job in any
classification tasks. How much the model is accurate, if the deciding boundary
is not picked up carefully, its entire performance would go in vain. On the
other hand, for imbalance classification where one of the classes is dominant
over another, relying on the conventional method of choosing threshold would
result in poor performance. Even if the threshold or decision boundary is
properly chosen based on machine learning strategies like SVM and decision
tree, it will fail at some point for dynamically varying databases and in case
of identity-features that are more or less similar, like in face recognition
and person re-identification models. Hence, with the need for adaptability of
the decision threshold selection for imbalanced classification and incremental
database size, an online optimization-based statistical feature learning
adaptive technique is developed and tested on the LFW datasets and
self-prepared athletes datasets. This method of adopting adaptive threshold
resulted in 12-45% improvement in the model accuracy compared to the fixed

any classification and identification tasks. Source code for the complete

developed to solve classification problems. However, SVMs are likely to perform
poorly in the classification of imbalanced data. The rough set theory presents
a mathematical tool for inference in nondeterministic cases that provides
methods for removing irrelevant information from data. In this work, we propose
an approach that efficiently used fuzzy rough set theory in weighted least
squares twin support vector machine called FRLSTSVM for classification of
imbalanced data. The first innovation is introducing a new fuzzy rough
set-based under-sampling strategy to make the classifier robust in terms of the
imbalanced data. For constructing the two proximal hyperplanes in FRLSTSVM,
data points from the minority class remain unchanged while a subset of data
points in the majority class are selected using a new method. In this model, we
embed the weight biases in the LSTSVM formulations to overcome the bias
phenomenon in the original twin SVM for the classification of imbalanced data.
In order to determine these weights in this formulation, we introduce a new
strategy that uses fuzzy rough set theory as the second innovation.
Experimental results on the famous imbalanced datasets, compared to the related
traditional SVM-based methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
FRLSTSVM model in the imbalanced data classification.</span>

adversarial examples that exploit the systemic vulnerabilities and enable
physically realizable and robust attacks against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
UAPs generalize across many different inputs; this leads to realistic and
effective attacks that can be applied at scale. In this paper we propose
HyperNeuron, an efficient and scalable algorithm that allows for the real-time
detection of UAPs by identifying suspicious neuron hyper-activations. Our
results show the effectiveness of HyperNeuron on multiple tasks (image
classification, object detection), against a wide variety of universal attacks,
and in realistic scenarios, like perceptual ad-blocking and adversarial
patches. HyperNeuron is able to simultaneously detect both adversarial mask and
patch UAPs with comparable or better performance than existing UAP defenses
whilst introducing a significantly reduced latency of only 0.86 milliseconds
per image. This suggests that many realistic and practical universal attacks
can be reliably mitigated in real-time, which shows promise for the robust
deployment of machine learning systems.</span>

                                        <span>Channel pruning and tensor decomposition have received extensive attention in
convolutional neural network compression. However, these two techniques are
traditionally deployed in an isolated manner, leading to significant accuracy
drop when pursuing high compression rates. In this paper, we propose a
Collaborative Compression (CC) scheme, which joints channel pruning and tensor
decomposition to compress CNN models by simultaneously learning the model
sparsity and low-rankness. Specifically, we first investigate the compression
sensitivity of each layer in the network, and then propose a Global Compression
Rate Optimization that transforms the decision problem of compression rate into
an optimization problem. After that, we propose multi-step heuristic
compression to remove redundant compression units step-by-step, which fully
considers the effect of the remaining compression space (i.e., unremoved
compression units). Our method demonstrates superior performance gains over
previous ones on various datasets and backbone architectures. For example, we
achieve 52.9% FLOPs reduction by removing 48.4% parameters on ResNet-50 with
only a Top-1 accuracy drop of 0.56% on ImageNet 2012.</span>

introduce a self-attention and orientation encoding network (SOE-Net) that
fully explores the relationship between points and incorporates long-range

eight orientations is captured in a PointOE module, whereas long-range feature
dependencies among local descriptors are captured with a self-attention unit.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function called Hard Positive Hard Negative

                                        <span>Recent advances on Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown that
self-attention-based networks, which take advantage of long-range dependencies
modeling ability, surpassed traditional convolution neural networks (CNNs) in
most vision tasks. To further expand the applicability for computer vision,
many improved variants are proposed to re-design the Transformer architecture
by considering the superiority of CNNs, i.e., locality, translation invariance,
for better performance. However, these methods only consider the standard
accuracy or computation cost of the model. In this paper, we rethink the design
principles of ViTs based on the robustness. We found some design components
greatly harm the robustness and generalization ability of ViTs while some
others are beneficial. By combining the robust design components, we propose
Robust Vision Transformer (RVT). RVT is a new vision transformer, which has
superior performance and strong robustness. We further propose two new
plug-and-play techniques called position-aware attention rescaling and
patch-wise augmentation to train our RVT. The experimental results on ImageNet
and six robustness benchmarks show the advanced robustness and generalization
ability of RVT compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs.
Our RVT-S* also achieves Top-1 rank on multiple robustness leaderboards
including ImageNet-C and ImageNet-Sketch. The code will be available at

                                        <span>Monocular 3D human pose estimation from a single RGB image has received a lot
attentions in the past few year. Pose inference models with competitive
performance however require supervision with 3D pose ground truth data or at
least known pose priors in their target domain. Yet, these data requirements in
many real-world applications with data collection constraints may not be
achievable. In this paper, we present a heuristic weakly supervised solution,
called HW-HuP to estimate 3D human pose in contexts that no ground truth 3D
data is accessible, even for fine-tuning. HW-HuP learns partial pose priors
from public 3D human pose datasets and uses easy-to-access observations from
the target domain to iteratively estimate 3D human pose and shape in an
optimization and regression hybrid cycle. In our design, depth data as an
auxiliary information is employed as weak supervision during training, yet it
is not needed for the inference. We evaluate HW-HuP performance qualitatively
on datasets of both in-bed human and infant poses, where no ground truth 3D
pose is provided neither any target prior. We also test HW-HuP performance
quantitatively on a publicly available motion capture dataset against the 3D
ground truth. HW-HuP is also able to be extended to other input modalities for
pose estimation tasks especially under adverse vision conditions, such as
occlusion or full darkness. On the Human3.6M benchmark, HW-HuP shows 104.1mm in
MPJPE and 50.4mm in PA MPJPE, comparable to the existing state-of-the-art
approaches that benefit from full 3D pose supervision.</span>

                                        <span>We show a straightforward and useful methodology for performing instance
segmentation using synthetic data. We apply this methodology on a basic case
and derived insights through quantitative analysis. We created a new public
dataset: The Expo Markers Dataset intended for detection and segmentation
tasks. This dataset contains 5,000 synthetic photorealistic images with their
corresponding pixel-perfect segmentation ground truth. The goal is to achieve
high performance on manually-gathered and annotated real-world data of custom
objects. We do that by creating 3D models of the target objects and other
possible distraction objects and place them within a simulated environment.
Expo Markers were chosen for this task, fitting our requirements of a custom
object due to the exact texture, size and 3D shape. An additional advantage is
the availability of this object in offices around the world for easy testing
and validation of our results. We generate the data using a domain
randomization technique that also simulates other photorealistic objects in the
scene, known as distraction objects. These objects provide visual complexity,
occlusions, and lighting challenges to help our model gain robustness in
training. We are also releasing our manually-gathered datasets used for
comparison and evaluation of our synthetic dataset. This white-paper provides
strong evidence that photorealistic simulated data can be used in practical
real world applications as a more scalable and flexible solution than
manually-captured data. Code is available at the following address:

high performance in terms of accuracy, people are concerned about if these
models inappropriately make inferences using irrelevant features that are not
encoded from the target object in a given image. To address the concern, we
propose a metamorphic testing approach that assesses if a given inference is
made based on irrelevant features. Specifically, we propose two novel
metamorphic relations to detect such inappropriate inferences. We applied our
approach to 10 image classification models and 10 object detection models, with
three large datasets, i.e., ImageNet, COCO, and Pascal VOC. Over 5.3% of the
top-5 correct predictions made by the image classification models are subject
to inappropriate inferences using irrelevant features. The corresponding rate
for the object detection models is over 8.5%. Based on the findings, we further
designed a new image generation strategy that can effectively attack existing
models. Comparing with a baseline approach, our strategy can double the success
rate of attacks.</span>

to denote three-dimensional (3-D) deformity of spine. We propose an automatic
segmentation method based on Stacked Hourglass Network (SHN) to detect the
spinous processes (SP) on ultrasound (US) spine images and to measure the SPAs
of clinical scoliotic subjects. Methods: The network was trained to detect
vertebral SP and laminae as five landmarks on 1200 ultrasound transverse images
and validated on 100 images. All the processed transverse images with
highlighted SP and laminae were reconstructed into a 3D image volume, and the
SPAs were measured on the projected coronal images. The trained network was
tested on 400 images by calculating the percentage of correct keypoints (PCK);
and the SPA measurements were evaluated on 50 scoliotic subjects by comparing
the results from US images and radiographs. Results: The trained network
achieved a high average PCK (86.8%) on the test datasets, particularly the PCK
of SP detection was 90.3%. The SPAs measured from US and radiographic methods
showed good correlation (r&gt;0.85), and the mean absolute differences (MAD)
between two modalities were 3.3{\deg}, which was less than the clinical
acceptance error (5{\deg}). Conclusion: The vertebral features can be
accurately segmented on US spine images using SHN, and the measurement results
of SPA from US data was comparable to the gold standard from radiography.</span>

present in this research area, highlighting the computer vision methods,
staining techniques, evaluation metrics, and the availability of the used
datasets and computer code. As a result, we identified that the most used
methods in the analyzed works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer
works employ classic computer vision only (101 papers). The most recurrent
metric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy (33 papers
and 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient
(38 papers). Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed
one (130 papers), followed by H&amp;E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of
the datasets used in the papers are publicly available, with the DTU/Herlev
dataset being the most used one. We conclude that there still is a lack of
high-quality datasets for many types of stains and most of the works are not
mature enough to be applied in a daily clinical diagnostic routine. We also
identified a growing tendency towards adopting deep learning-based approaches
as the methods of choice.</span>

architecture that can be trained to recognize full pages of handwritten or
printed text without image segmentation. Being based on Image to Sequence
architecture, it can extract text present in an image and then sequence it
correctly without imposing any constraints regarding orientation, layout and
size of text and non-text. Further, it can also be trained to generate
auxiliary markup related to formatting, layout and content. We use character
level vocabulary, thereby enabling language and terminology of any subject. The
model achieves a new state-of-art in paragraph level recognition on the IAM
dataset. When evaluated on scans of real world handwritten free form test
answers - beset with curved and slanted lines, drawings, tables, math,
chemistry and other symbols - it performs better than all commercially

                                        <span>Existing methods for vision-and-language learning typically require designing
task-specific architectures and objectives for each task. For example, a
multi-label answer classifier for visual question answering, a region scorer
for referring expression comprehension, and a language decoder for image
captioning, etc. To alleviate these hassles, in this work, we propose a unified
framework that learns different tasks in a single architecture with the same
language modeling objective, i.e., multimodal conditional text generation,
where our models learn to generate labels in text based on the visual and
textual inputs. On 7 popular vision-and-language benchmarks, including visual
question answering, referring expression comprehension, visual commonsense
reasoning, most of which have been previously modeled as discriminative tasks,
our generative approach (with a single unified architecture) reaches comparable
performance to recent task-specific state-of-the-art vision-and-language
models. Moreover, our generative approach shows better generalization ability
on questions that have rare answers. Also, we show that our framework allows
multi-task learning in a single architecture with a single set of parameters,
achieving similar performance to separately optimized single-task models. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/j-min/VL-T5</span>

distinct changes in object appearance and thus confuse the deep neural network

collecting sufficient training samples could be time-consuming and expensive.
To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel neural network

to separate illumination features from images, and then during training we
augment training samples with these separated illumination features in the

                                        <span>We introduce NExT-QA, a rigorously designed video question answering
(VideoQA) benchmark to advance video understanding from describing to
explaining the temporal actions. Based on the dataset, we set up multi-choice
and open-ended QA tasks targeting causal action reasoning, temporal action
reasoning, and common scene comprehension. Through extensive analysis of
baselines and established VideoQA techniques, we find that top-performing
methods excel at shallow scene descriptions but are weak in causal and temporal
action reasoning. Furthermore, the models that are effective on multi-choice
QA, when adapted to open-ended QA, still struggle in generalizing the answers.
This raises doubt on the ability of these models to reason and highlights
possibilities for improvement. With detailed results for different question
types and heuristic observations for future works, we hope NExT-QA will guide
the next generation of VQA research to go beyond superficial scene description
towards a deeper understanding of videos. (The dataset and related resources

                                        <span>There have been a number of corner detection methods proposed for event
cameras in the last years, since event-driven computer vision has become more
accessible. Current state-of-the-art have either unsatisfactory accuracy or
real-time performance when considered for practical use; random motion using a
live camera in an unconstrained environment. In this paper, we present yet
another method to perform corner detection, dubbed look-up event-Harris
(luvHarris), that employs the Harris algorithm for high accuracy but manages an
improved event throughput. Our method has two major contributions, 1. a novel
&quot;threshold ordinal event-surface&quot; that removes certain tuning parameters and is
well suited for Harris operations, and 2. an implementation of the Harris
algorithm such that the computational load per-event is minimised and
computational heavy convolutions are performed only &#x27;as-fast-as-possible&#x27;, i.e.
only as computational resources are available. The result is a practical,
real-time, and robust corner detector that runs more than $2.6\times$ the speed
of current state-of-the-art; a necessity when using high-resolution
event-camera in real-time. We explain the considerations taken for the
approach, compare the algorithm to current state-of-the-art in terms of
computational performance and detection accuracy, and discuss the validity of
the proposed approach for event cameras.</span>

                                        <span>Vision and language understanding techniques have achieved remarkable
progress, but currently it is still difficult to well handle problems involving
very fine-grained details. For example, when the robot is told to &quot;bring me the
book in the girl&#x27;s left hand&quot;, most existing methods would fail if the girl
holds one book respectively in her left and right hand. In this work, we
introduce a new task named human-centric relation segmentation (HRS), as a
fine-grained case of HOI-det. HRS aims to predict the relations between the
human and surrounding entities and identify the relation-correlated human
parts, which are represented as pixel-level masks. For the above exemplar case,
our HRS task produces results in the form of relation triplets  and exacts segmentation masks of the book, with which the
robot can easily accomplish the grabbing task. Correspondingly, we collect a
new Person In Context (PIC) dataset for this new task, which contains 17,122
high-resolution images and densely annotated entity segmentation and relations,
including 141 object categories, 23 relation categories and 25 semantic human
parts. We also propose a Simultaneous Matching and Segmentation (SMS) framework
as a solution to the HRS task. I Outputs of the three branches are fused to
produce the final HRS results. Extensive experiments on PIC and V-COCO datasets
show that the proposed SMS method outperforms baselines with the 36 FPS
inference speed.</span>

neural networks (CNNs) to extract features. However, due to their limited
receptive fields, CNNs can not fully exploit the global temporal and spatial
information in successive video frames, resulting in false-positive
segmentation results. In this paper, we propose the novel PNS-Net
(Progressively Normalized Self-attention Network), which can efficiently learn
representations from polyp videos with real-time speed (~140fps) on a single
RTX 2080 GPU and no post-processing. Our PNS-Net is based solely on a basic
normalized self-attention block, equipping with recurrence and CNNs entirely.
Experiments on challenging VPS datasets demonstrate that the proposed PNS-Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also conduct extensive experiments to
study the effectiveness of the channel split, soft-attention, and progressive
learning strategy. We find that our PNS-Net works well under different

which can potentially be used for several applications. However, noise, band
correlations and high dimensionality restrict the applicability of such data.
This is recently addressed using creative deep learning network architectures
such as ResNet, SSRN, and A2S2K. However, the last layer, i.e the
classification layer, remains unchanged and is taken to be the softmax
classifier. In this article, we propose to use a watershed classifier.
Watershed classifier extends the watershed operator from Mathematical
Morphology for classification. In its vanilla form, the watershed classifier
does not have any trainable parameters. In this article, we propose a novel
approach to train deep learning networks to obtain representations suitable for
the watershed classifier. The watershed classifier exploits the connectivity
patterns, a characteristic of HSI datasets, for better inference. We show that
exploiting such characteristics allows the Triplet-Watershed to achieve
state-of-art results in supervised and semi-supervised contexts. These results
are validated on Indianpines (IP), University of Pavia (UP), Kennedy Space
Center (KSC) and University of Houston (UH) datasets, relying on simple convnet
architecture using a quarter of parameters compared to previous
state-of-the-art networks.</span>

operation in 3D geometry processing. Several recent state-of-the-art methods
address this problem using neural networks to learn signed distance functions
(SDFs). In this paper, we introduce \textit{Neural-Pull}, a new approach that
is simple and leads to high quality SDFs. Specifically, we train a neural
network to pull query 3D locations to their closest points on the surface using
the predicted signed distance values and the gradient at the query locations,
both of which are computed by the network itself. The pulling operation moves
each query location with a stride given by the distance predicted by the
network. Based on the sign of the distance, this may move the query location
along or against the direction of the gradient of the SDF. This is a
differentiable operation that allows us to update the signed distance value and
the gradient simultaneously during training. Our outperforming results under
widely used benchmarks demonstrate that we can learn SDFs more accurately and
flexibly for surface reconstruction and single image reconstruction than the
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

clustering, in which an auto-encoder non-linearly maps the input data into a
latent space, and a fully connected layer named self-expressiveness module is
introduced to learn the affinity matrix via a typical regularization term
(e.g., sparse or low-rank). However, the adopted regularization terms ignore
the connectivity within each subspace, limiting their clustering performance.
In addition, the adopted framework suffers from the coupling issue between the
auto-encoder module and the self-expressiveness module, making the network
training non-trivial. To tackle these two issues, we propose a novel deep
subspace clustering method named Maximum Entropy Subspace Clustering Network
(MESC-Net). Specifically, MESC-Net maximizes the entropy of the affinity matrix
to promote the connectivity within each subspace, in which its elements
corresponding to the same subspace are uniformly and densely distributed.
Furthermore, we design a novel framework to explicitly decouple the
auto-encoder module and the self-expressiveness module. We also theoretically
prove that the learned affinity matrix satisfies the block-diagonal property
under the independent subspaces. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results
on commonly used benchmark datasets validate MESC-Net significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Learning discriminative representation using large-scale face datasets in the
wild is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains challenging. The
difficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource
constraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based
representation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have
demonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory
cost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training
set, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we
propose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically,
for each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are
dynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated
on-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is
selected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a
single server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale
datasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as
using all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a
few-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few
instances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest
public dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88%
of them have less than 10 instances. Code is available at

                                        <span>Automatic segmentation methods are an important advancement in medical image
analysis. Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular,
are the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with
class imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions
often occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss
functions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their
robustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence.
The most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the
cross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose a Unified
Focal loss, a new framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based
losses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on
three highly class imbalanced, publicly available medical imaging datasets:
Breast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and
Kidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function
performance against six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, and
demonstrate that our proposed loss function is robust to class imbalance,
outperforming the other loss functions across datasets. Finally, we use the
Unified Focal loss together with deep supervision to achieve state-of-the-art
results without modification of the original U-Net architecture, with a mean
Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)&#x3D;0.948 on BUS2017, enhancing tumour region
DSC&#x3D;0.800 on BraTS20 and kidney tumour DSC&#x3D;0.758 on KiTS19. This highlights the
importance of carefully selecting a suitable loss function prior to the use of
more complex architectures.</span>

and structural information benefits fine-grained object recognition that aims
to classify an object into one of many similar subcategories. However, for
multisource tasks that involve relatively small objects, even the smallest
registration errors can introduce high uncertainty in the classification
process. We approach this problem from a weakly supervised learning perspective
in which the input images correspond to larger neighborhoods around the
expected object locations where an object with a given class label is present
in the neighborhood without any knowledge of its exact location. The proposed
method uses a single-source deep instance attention model with parallel
branches for joint localization and classification of objects, and extends this
model into a multisource setting where a reference source that is assumed to
have no location uncertainty is used to aid the fusion of multiple sources in
four different levels: probability level, logit level, feature level, and pixel
level. We show that all levels of fusion provide higher accuracies compared to
the state-of-the-art, with the best performing method of feature-level fusion
resulting in 53% accuracy for the recognition of 40 different types of trees,
corresponding to an improvement of 5.7% over the best performing baseline when
RGB, multispectral, and LiDAR data are used. We also provide an in-depth
comparison by evaluating each model at various parameter complexity settings,
where the increased model capacity results in a further improvement of 6.3%
over the default capacity setting.</span>

                                        <span>Point cloud semantic segmentation is a crucial task in 3D scene
understanding. Existing methods mainly focus on employing a large number of
annotated labels for supervised semantic segmentation. Nonetheless, manually
labeling such large point clouds for the supervised segmentation task is
time-consuming. In order to reduce the number of annotated labels, we propose a
semi-supervised semantic point cloud segmentation network, named SSPC-Net,
where we train the semantic segmentation network by inferring the labels of
unlabeled points from the few annotated 3D points. In our method, we first
partition the whole point cloud into superpoints and build superpoint graphs to
mine the long-range dependencies in point clouds. Based on the constructed
superpoint graph, we then develop a dynamic label propagation method to
generate the pseudo labels for the unsupervised superpoints. Particularly, we
adopt a superpoint dropout strategy to dynamically select the generated pseudo
labels. In order to fully exploit the generated pseudo labels of the
unsupervised superpoints, we furthermore propose a coupled attention mechanism
for superpoint feature embedding. Finally, we employ the cross-entropy loss to
train the semantic segmentation network with the labels of the supervised
superpoints and the pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints. Experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that our semi-supervised segmentation method
can achieve better performance than the current semi-supervised segmentation
method with fewer annotated 3D points. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Purpose: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer
mortality worldwide. Colonoscopy is a widely used technique for colon screening
and polyp lesions diagnosis. Nevertheless, manual screening using colonoscopy
suffers from a substantial miss rate of polyps and is an overwhelming burden
for endoscopists. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for polyp detection has the
potential to reduce human error and human burden. However, current polyp
detection methods based on object detection framework need many handcrafted
pre-processing and post-processing operations or user guidance that require
domain-specific knowledge.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a convolution in transformer (COTR)
network for end-to-end polyp detection. Motivated by the detection transformer
(DETR), COTR is constituted by a CNN for feature extraction, transformer
encoder layers interleaved with convolutional layers for feature encoding and
recalibration, transformer decoder layers for object querying, and a
feed-forward network for detection prediction. Considering the slow convergence
of DETR, COTR embeds convolution layers into transformer encoder for feature
reconstruction and convergence acceleration.

Results: Experimental results on two public polyp datasets show that COTR
achieved 91.49\% precision, 82.69% sensitivity, and 86.87% F1-score on the
ETIS-LARIB, and 91.67% precision, 93.54% sensitivity, and 92.60% F1-score on
the CVC-ColonDB.

Conclusion: This study proposed an end to end detection method based on
detection transformer for colorectal polyp detection. Experimental results on
ETIS-LARIB and CVC-ColonDB dataset demonstrated that the proposed model
achieved comparable performance against state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, query based object detection frameworks achieve comparable
performance with previous state-of-the-art object detectors. However, how to
fully leverage such frameworks to perform instance segmentation remains an open
problem. In this paper, we present QueryInst (Instances as Queries), a query
based instance segmentation method driven by parallel supervision on dynamic
mask heads. The key insight of QueryInst is to leverage the intrinsic
one-to-one correspondence in object queries across different stages, as well as
one-to-one correspondence between mask RoI features and object queries in the
same stage. This approach eliminates the explicit multi-stage mask head
connection and the proposal distribution inconsistency issues inherent in
non-query based multi-stage instance segmentation methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., COCO, CityScapes, and
YouTube-VIS to evaluate the effectiveness of QueryInst in instance segmentation
and video instance segmentation (VIS) task. Specifically, using ResNet-101-FPN
backbone, QueryInst obtains 48.1 box AP and 42.8 mask AP on COCO test-dev,
which is 2 points higher than HTC in terms of both box AP and mask AP, while
runs 2.4 times faster. For video instance segmentation, QueryInst achieves the
best performance among all online VIS approaches and strikes a decent
speed-accuracy trade-off. Code is available at

                                        <span>Single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to obtain a high-resolution output
from one low-resolution image. Currently, deep learning-based SISR approaches
have been widely discussed in medical image processing, because of their
potential to achieve high-quality, high spatial resolution images without the
cost of additional scans. However, most existing methods are designed for
scale-specific SR tasks and are unable to generalise over magnification scales.
In this paper, we propose an approach for medical image arbitrary-scale
super-resolution (MIASSR), in which we couple meta-learning with generative
adversarial networks (GANs) to super-resolve medical images at any scale of
magnification in (1, 4]. Compared to state-of-the-art SISR algorithms on
single-modal magnetic resonance (MR) brain images (OASIS-brains) and
multi-modal MR brain images (BraTS), MIASSR achieves comparable fidelity
performance and the best perceptual quality with the smallest model size. We
also employ transfer learning to enable MIASSR to tackle SR tasks of new
medical modalities, such as cardiac MR images (ACDC) and chest computed
tomography images (COVID-CT). The source code of our work is also public. Thus,
MIASSR has the potential to become a new foundational pre-/post-processing step
in clinical image analysis tasks such as reconstruction, image quality
enhancement, and segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Visual localization is of great importance in robotics and computer vision.
Recently, scene coordinate regression based methods have shown good performance
in visual localization in small static scenes. However, it still estimates
camera poses from many inferior scene coordinates. To address this problem, we
propose a novel visual localization framework that establishes 2D-to-3D
correspondences between the query image and the 3D map with a series of
learnable scene-specific landmarks. In the landmark generation stage, the 3D
surfaces of the target scene are over-segmented into mosaic patches whose
centers are regarded as the scene-specific landmarks. To robustly and
accurately recover the scene-specific landmarks, we propose the Voting with
Segmentation Network (VS-Net) to segment the pixels into different landmark
patches with a segmentation branch and estimate the landmark locations within
each patch with a landmark location voting branch. Since the number of
landmarks in a scene may reach up to 5000, training a segmentation network with
such a large number of classes is both computation and memory costly for the
commonly used cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel prototype-based triplet
loss with hard negative mining, which is able to train semantic segmentation
networks with a large number of labels efficiently. Our proposed VS-Net is
extensively tested on multiple public benchmarks and can outperform
state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and models are available at

faces or face attributes) has posed a huge threat to our society. The fake
multimedia content generated by deepfake models can harm the reputation and
even threaten the property of the person who has been impersonated.
Fortunately, the adversarial watermark could be used for combating deepfake
models, leading them to generate distorted images. The existing methods require
an individual training process for every facial image, to generate the
adversarial watermark against a specific deepfake model, which are extremely
inefficient. To address this problem, we propose a universal adversarial attack
method on deepfake models, to generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial
Watermark (CMUA-Watermark) that can protect thousands of facial images from
multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we first propose a cross-model
universal attack pipeline by attacking multiple deepfake models and combining
gradients from these models iteratively. Then we introduce a batch-based method
to alleviate the conflict of adversarial watermarks generated by different
facial images. Finally, we design a more reasonable and comprehensive
evaluation method for evaluating the effectiveness of the adversarial
watermark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMUA-Watermark
can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by deepfake models and

                                        <span>Recent studies imply that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
examples -- inputs with a slight but intentional perturbation are incorrectly
classified by the network. Such vulnerability makes it risky for some
security-related applications (e.g., semantic segmentation in autonomous cars)
and triggers tremendous concerns on the model reliability. For the first time,
we comprehensively evaluate the robustness of existing UDA methods and propose
a robust UDA approach. It is rooted in two observations: (i) the robustness of
UDA methods in semantic segmentation remains unexplored, which pose a security
concern in this field; and (ii) although commonly used self-supervision (e.g.,
rotation and jigsaw) benefits image tasks such as classification and
recognition, they fail to provide the critical supervision signals that could
learn discriminative representation for segmentation tasks. These observations
motivate us to propose adversarial self-supervision UDA (or ASSUDA) that
maximizes the agreement between clean images and their adversarial examples by
a contrastive loss in the output space. Extensive empirical studies on commonly
used benchmarks demonstrate that ASSUDA is resistant to adversarial attacks.</span>

                                        <span>The convolution operation is a central building block of neural network
architectures widely used in computer vision. The size of the convolution
kernels determines both the expressiveness of convolutional neural networks
(CNN), as well as the number of learnable parameters. Increasing the network
capacity to capture rich pixel relationships requires increasing the number of
learnable parameters, often leading to overfitting and/or lack of robustness.
In this paper, we propose a powerful novel building block, the
hyper-convolution, which implicitly represents the convolution kernel as a
function of kernel coordinates. Hyper-convolutions enable decoupling the kernel
size, and hence its receptive field, from the number of learnable parameters.
In our experiments, focused on challenging biomedical image segmentation tasks,
we demonstrate that replacing regular convolutions with hyper-convolutions
leads to more efficient architectures that achieve improved accuracy. Our
analysis also shows that learned hyper-convolutions are naturally regularized,
which can offer better generalization performance. We believe that
hyper-convolutions can be a powerful building block in future neural network
architectures solving computer vision tasks.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the challenging blind denoising problem for Poisson-Gaussian
noise, in which no additional information about clean images or noise level
parameters is available. Particularly, when only &quot;single&quot; noisy images are
available for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing
methods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image
denoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in
the above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which
utilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow
inference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and
that of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we
propose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise,
which consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates
Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional
methods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise
affine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.
Consequently, we show that our FBI-Denoiser blindly trained solely based on
single noisy images can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several
real-world noisy image benchmark datasets with much faster inference time (x
10), compared to BP-AIDE. The official code of our method is available at

                                        <span>Hand pose estimation is a crucial part of a wide range of augmented reality
and human-computer interaction applications. Predicting the 3D hand pose from a
single RGB image is challenging due to occlusion and depth ambiguities.
GCN-based (Graph Convolutional Networks) methods exploit the structural
relationship similarity between graphs and hand joints to model kinematic
dependencies between joints. These techniques use predefined or globally
learned joint relationships, which may fail to capture pose-dependent
constraints. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage GCN-based
framework that learns per-pose relationship constraints. Specifically, the
first phase quantizes the 2D/3D space to classify the joints into 2D/3D blocks
based on their locality. This spatial dependency information guides this phase
to estimate reliable 2D and 3D poses. The second stage further improves the 3D
estimation through a GCN-based module that uses an adaptative nearest neighbor
algorithm to determine joint relationships. Extensive experiments show that our
multi-stage GCN approach yields an efficient model that produces accurate 2D/3D
hand poses and outperforms the state-of-the-art on two public datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Searching for a more compact network width recently serves as an effective
way of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfill the searching, a one-shot
supernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance
\wrt~different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a
\textit{unilaterally augmented} (UA) principle for the evaluation of each
width, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this
paper, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet)
to address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible
for the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated
more accurately. Besides, we leverage a stochastic complementary strategy for
training the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population sampling method to
boost the performance of the evolutionary search. Extensive experiments on
benchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our method can achieve
state-of-the-art or competing performance over other baseline methods.
Moreover, our method turns out to further boost the performance of NAS models
by refining their network widths. For example, with the same FLOPs budget, our
obtained EfficientNet-B0 achieves 77.36\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset,
surpassing the performance of original setting by 0.48\%.</span>

automated algorithms that can convert digital images of scanned documents into
machine readable information is rapidly growing. Besides the opportunity of
data digitization for the application of data analytic tools, there is also a
massive improvement towards automation of processes, which previously would
require manual inspection of the documents. Although the introduction of
optical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting
human-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the
task of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years. The
recognition of tables consists of two main tasks, namely table detection and
table structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either
task without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real
application conditions like rotated images or noise artefacts inside the
document image. Recent work shows a clear trend towards deep learning
approaches coupled with the use of transfer learning for the task of table
structure recognition due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this
paper we present a multistage pipeline named Multi-Type-TD-TSR, which offers an
end-to-end solution for the problem of table recognition. It utilizes
state-of-the-art deep learning models for table detection and differentiates
between 3 different types of tables based on the tables&#x27; borders. For the table
structure recognition we use a deterministic non-data driven algorithm, which
works on all table types. We additionally present two algorithms. One for
unbordered tables and one for bordered tables, which are the base of the used
table structure recognition algorithm. We evaluate Multi-Type-TD-TSR on the
ICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset and achieve a new
state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Book covers are intentionally designed and provide an introduction to a book.
However, they typically require professional skills to design and produce the
cover images. Thus, we propose a generative neural network that can produce
book covers based on an easy-to-use layout graph. The layout graph contains
objects such as text, natural scene objects, and solid color spaces. This
layout graph is embedded using a graph convolutional neural network and then
used with a mask proposal generator and a bounding-box generator and filled
using an object proposal generator. Next, the objects are compiled into a
single image and the entire network is trained using a combination of
adversarial training, perceptual training, and reconstruction. Finally, a Style
Retention Network (SRNet) is used to transfer the learned font style onto the
desired text. Using the proposed method allows for easily controlled and unique
book covers.</span>

                                        <span>Resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, have become
ubiquitous in recent years. This has led to the generation of large quantities
of data in real-time, which is an appealing target for AI systems. However,
deploying machine learning models on such end-devices is nearly impossible. A
typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such
as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to
increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this
issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge
of the network, i.e close to the IoT devices where the data is generated.
Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates
the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data
sources. This survey describes major research efforts where machine learning
systems have been deployed at the edge of computer networks, focusing on the
operational aspects including compression techniques, tools, frameworks, and
hardware used in successful applications of intelligent edge systems.</span>

setting for anomaly detection where a small additional set of labeled samples
are provided. Based on the analysis of Deep SAD, the state-of-the-art for
semi-supervised anomaly detection, we propose a new KL-divergence based
objective function and show that two factors: the mutual information between
the data and latent representations, and the entropy of latent representations,
constitute an integral objective function for anomaly detection. To resolve the
contradiction in simultaneously optimizing the two factors, we propose a novel
encoder-decoder-encoder structure, with the first encoder focusing on
optimizing the mutual information and the second encoder focusing on optimizing
the entropy. The two encoders are enforced to share similar encoding with a
consistent constraint on their latent representations. Extensive experiments
have revealed that the proposed method significantly outperforms several
state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmark datasets, including medical diagnosis
and several classic anomaly detection benchmarks.</span>

morphological features of pure and mixed urinary stones using intraoperative
digital endoscopic images acquired in a clinical setting. Materials and
methods: In this single-centre study, an experienced urologist intraoperatively
and prospectively examined the surface and section of all kidney stones
encountered. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM/Ia), dihydrate (COD/IIb) and uric
acid (UA/IIIb) morphological criteria were collected and classified to generate
annotated datasets. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to
predict the composition of both pure and mixed stones. To explain the
predictions of the deep neural network model, coarse localisation heat-maps
were plotted to pinpoint key areas identified by the network. Results: This
study included 347 and 236 observations of stone surface and stone section,
respectively. A highest sensitivity of 98 % was obtained for the type &quot;pure
IIIb/UA&quot; using surface images. The most frequently encountered morphology was
that of the type &quot;pure Ia/COM&quot;; it was correctly predicted in 91 % and 94 % of
cases using surface and section images, respectively. Of the mixed type
&quot;Ia/COM+IIb/COD&quot;, Ia/COM was predicted in 84 % of cases using surface images,
IIb/COD in 70 % of cases, and both in 65 % of cases. Concerning mixed
Ia/COM+IIIb/UA stones, Ia/COM was predicted in 91 % of cases using section
images, IIIb/UA in 69 % of cases, and both in 74 % of cases. Conclusions: This
preliminary study demonstrates that deep convolutional neural networks are
promising to identify kidney stone composition from endoscopic images acquired
intraoperatively. Both pure and mixed stone composition could be discriminated.
Collected in a clinical setting, surface and section images analysed by deep
CNN provide valuable information about stone morphology for computer-aided
diagnosis.</span>

answering by extending the BERT architecture with multi-modal pre-training

learning tasks in the medical domain, specifically using radiology images and
the unstructured report. We propose Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL)
which adopts a Transformer-based architecture combined with a novel multimodal
attention masking scheme to maximize generalization performance for both
vision-language understanding tasks (image-report retrieval, disease
classification, medical visual question answering) and vision-language
generation task (report generation). By rigorously evaluating the proposed
model on four downstream tasks with two chest X-ray image datasets (MIMIC-CXR

surroundings of a self-driving vehicle (SDV) and predicting how these
surroundings will change in the near future. To address this task we propose
MultiXNet, an end-to-end approach for detection and motion prediction based
directly on lidar sensor data. This approach builds on prior work by handling
multiple classes of traffic actors, adding a jointly trained second-stage
trajectory refinement step, and producing a multimodal probability distribution
over future actor motion that includes both multiple discrete traffic behaviors
and calibrated continuous position uncertainties. The method was evaluated on
large-scale, real-world data collected by a fleet of SDVs in several cities,
with the results indicating that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Background: The quantitative analysis of microscope videos often requires
instance segmentation and tracking of cellular and subcellular objects. The
traditional method consists of two stages: (1) performing instance object
segmentation of each frame, and (2) associating objects frame-by-frame.
Recently, pixel-embedding-based deep learning approaches these two steps
simultaneously as a single stage holistic solution. In computer vision,
annotated training data with consistent segmentation and tracking is resource
intensive, the severity of which is multiplied in microscopy imaging due to (1)
dense objects (e.g., overlapping or touching), and (2) high dynamics (e.g.,
irregular motion and mitosis). Adversarial simulations have provided successful
solutions to alleviate the lack of such annotations in dynamics scenes in
computer vision, such as using simulated environments (e.g., computer games) to
train real-world self-driving systems. Methods: In this paper, we propose an
annotation-free synthetic instance segmentation and tracking (ASIST) method
with adversarial simulation and single-stage pixel-embedding based learning.
Contribution: The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) the proposed
method aggregates adversarial simulations and single-stage pixel-embedding
based deep learning; (2) the method is assessed with both the cellular (i.e.,
HeLa cells) and subcellular (i.e., microvilli) objects; and (3) to the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to explore annotation-free instance
segmentation and tracking study for microscope videos. Results: The ASIST
method achieved an important step forward, when compared with fully supervised
approaches: ASIST shows 7% to 11% higher segmentation, detection and tracking
performance on microvilli relative to fully supervised methods, and comparable
performance on Hela cell videos.</span>

                                        <span>Constructing effective image priors is critical to solving ill-posed inverse
problems in image processing and imaging. Recent works proposed to exploit
image non-local similarity for inverse problems by grouping similar patches and
demonstrated state-of-the-art results in many applications. However, compared
to classic methods based on filtering or sparsity, most of the non-local
algorithms are time-consuming, mainly due to the highly inefficient and
redundant block matching step, where the distance between each pair of
overlapping patches needs to be computed. In this work, we propose a novel
Self-Convolution operator to exploit image non-local similarity in a
self-supervised way. The proposed Self-Convolution can generalize the
commonly-used block matching step and produce equivalent results with much
cheaper computation. Furthermore, by applying Self-Convolution, we propose an
effective multi-modality image restoration scheme, which is much more efficient
than conventional block matching for non-local modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate that (1) Self-Convolution can significantly speed up most of the
popular non-local image restoration algorithms, with two-fold to nine-fold
faster block matching, and (2) the proposed multi-modality image restoration
scheme achieves superior denoising results in both efficiency and effectiveness
on RGB-NIR images. The code is publicly available at

                                        <span>Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or
offices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object,
we jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in;
the same type of container will have a different probability of having the
target depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic
information to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects
are best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a
3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and
geometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search
process, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that
guides an agent&#x27;s actions towards finding a target object specified with a
natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network
architecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual,
geometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of
the graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a
novel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically
related objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better
than several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in
terms of the median number of actions required. Additional qualitative results
can be found at https://ai.stanford.edu/mech-search/hms.</span>

revolutionizes medicine and biology. The imaging speed of high-dimensional MRI
is often limited, which constrains its practical utility. Recently, low-rank
tensor models have been exploited to enable fast MR imaging with sparse
sampling. Most existing methods use some pre-defined sampling design, and
active sensing has not been explored for low-rank tensor imaging. In this
paper, we introduce an active low-rank tensor model for fast MR imaging. We
propose an active sampling method based on a Query-by-Committee model, making
use of the benefits of low-rank tensor structure. Numerical experiments on a
3-D MRI data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

models in two tasks that require multimodal integration: (1) discriminating a
correct image-sentence pair from an incorrect one, and (2) counting entities in
an image. We evaluate three pretrained V&amp;L models on these tasks: ViLBERT,
ViLBERT 12-in-1 and LXMERT, in zero-shot and finetuned settings. Our results
show that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are
pretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&amp;L models is able to
adequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to
out-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these
findings: LXMERT (and to some extent ViLBERT 12-in-1) show some evidence of
catastrophic forgetting on task (1). Concerning our results on the counting
probe, we find evidence that all models are impacted by dataset bias, and also
fail to individuate entities in the visual input. While a selling point of
pretrained V&amp;L models is their ability to solve complex tasks, our findings
suggest that understanding their reasoning and grounding capabilities requires
more targeted investigations on specific phenomena.</span>

properties to Vision Transformer (ViT) that stand out compared to convolutional
networks (convnets). Beyond the fact that adapting self-supervised methods to
this architecture works particularly well, we make the following observations:
first, self-supervised ViT features contain explicit information about the
semantic segmentation of an image, which does not emerge as clearly with
supervised ViTs, nor with convnets. Second, these features are also excellent
k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study
also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and
the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple
self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of
self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between DINO and ViTs by
achieving 80.1% top-1 on ImageNet in linear evaluation with ViT-Base.</span>

role. We propose a novel approach which protects identity information of facial

generative adversarial networks trained on a conditional multi-scale

                                        <span>The performance of object detection, to a great extent, depends on the
availability of large annotated datasets. To alleviate the annotation cost, the
research community has explored a number of ways to exploit unlabeled or weakly
labeled data. However, such efforts have met with limited success so far. In
this work, we revisit the problem with a pragmatic standpoint, trying to
explore a new balance between detection performance and annotation cost by
jointly exploiting fully and weakly annotated data. Specifically, we propose a
weakly- and semi-supervised object detection framework (WSSOD), which involves
a two-stage learning procedure. An agent detector is first trained on a joint
dataset and then used to predict pseudo bounding boxes on weakly-annotated
images. The underlying assumptions in the current as well as common
semi-supervised pipelines are also carefully examined under a unified EM
formulation. On top of this framework, weakly-supervised loss (WSL), label
attention and random pseudo-label sampling (RPS) strategies are introduced to
relax these assumptions, bringing additional improvement on the efficacy of the
detection pipeline. The proposed framework demonstrates remarkable performance
on PASCAL-VOC and MSCOCO benchmark, achieving a high performance comparable to
those obtained in fully-supervised settings, with only one third of the
annotations.</span>

                                        <span>Screening for the diagnosis of glaucoma through a fundus image can be
determined by the optic cup to disc diameter ratio (CDR), which requires the
segmentation of the cup and disc regions. In this paper, we propose two novel
approaches, namely Parameter-Shared Branched Network (PSBN) andWeak Region of
Interest Model-based segmentation (WRoIM) to identify disc and cup boundaries.
Unlike the previous approaches, the proposed methods are trained end-to-end
through a single neural network architecture and use dynamic cropping instead
of manual or traditional computer vision-based cropping. We are able to achieve
similar performance as that of state-of-the-art approaches with less number of
network parameters. Our experiments include comparison with different best
known methods on publicly available Drishti-GS1 and RIM-ONE v3 datasets. With
$7.8 \times 10^6$ parameters our approach achieves a Dice score of 0.96/0.89
for disc/cup segmentation on Drishti-GS1 data whereas the existing
state-of-the-art approach uses $19.8\times 10^6$ parameters to achieve a dice
score of 0.97/0.89.</span>

highly useful. In this paper, we propose the deep learning based cost-effective

                                        <span>Zero-shot object recognition or zero-shot learning aims to transfer the
object recognition ability among the semantically related categories, such as
fine-grained animal or bird species. However, the images of different
fine-grained objects tend to merely exhibit subtle differences in appearance,
which will severely deteriorate zero-shot object recognition. To reduce the
superfluous information in the fine-grained objects, in this paper, we propose
to learn the redundancy-free features for generalized zero-shot learning. We
achieve our motivation by projecting the original visual features into a new
(redundancy-free) feature space and then restricting the statistical dependence
between these two feature spaces. Furthermore, we require the projected
features to keep and even strengthen the category relationship in the
redundancy-free feature space. In this way, we can remove the redundant
information from the visual features without losing the discriminative
information. We extensively evaluate the performance on four benchmark
datasets. The results show that our redundancy-free feature based generalized
zero-shot learning (RFF-GZSL) approach can achieve competitive results compared
with the state-of-the-arts.</span>

can be clinically graded by examining the structural representations of Gleason
tissues. This paper proposes the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge,
for segmenting the Gleason tissues to grade PCa via the whole slide images

synergy of hybrid dilation factors and hierarchical decomposition of latent
space representation for effective Gleason tissues extraction, and 2) A
three-tiered loss function which can penalize different semantic segmentation
models for accurately extracting the highly correlated patterns. In addition to
this, the proposed framework has been extensively evaluated on a large-scale
PCa dataset containing 10,516 whole slide scans (with around 71.7M patches),
where it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by 3.22% (in terms of mean
intersection-over-union) for extracting the Gleason tissues and 6.91% (in terms

                                        <span>With the explosive growth of video data, video summarization, which attempts
to seek the minimum subset of frames while still conveying the main story, has
become one of the hottest topics. Nowadays, substantial achievements have been
made by supervised learning techniques, especially after the emergence of deep
learning. However, it is extremely expensive and difficult to collect human
annotation for large-scale video datasets. To address this problem, we propose
a convolutional attentive adversarial network (CAAN), whose key idea is to
build a deep summarizer in an unsupervised way. Upon the generative adversarial
network, our overall framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The
former predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter
tries to distinguish the score-weighted frame features from original frame
features. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence
network to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based
network to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our
objective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the
frame-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this
proposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public
benchmarks SumMe and TVSum. The results show the superiority of our proposed
method against other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. Our method even
outperforms some published supervised approaches.</span>

sequences which consist of 3D skeleton joints. While many research work are
devoted to 3D action recognition, it mainly suffers from three problems: highly
complicated articulation, a great amount of noise, and a low implementation
efficiency. To tackle all these problems, we propose a real-time 3D action
recognition framework by integrating the locally aggregated kinematic-guided
skeletonlet (LAKS) with a supervised hashing-by-analysis (SHA) model. We first
define the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms
of kinematic principle, and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which
consists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising
phase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features
within it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the
locally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the
skeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the
sequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a
hashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining a
high efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D, UTKinectAction3D and
Florence3DAction datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and implementation
efficiency.</span>

sim-to-real transfer can help satisfy the large data requirements. In this
paper, we study the problem of zero-shot sim-to-real when the task requires
both highly precise control, with sub-millimetre error tolerance, and full
workspace generalisation. Our framework involves a coarse-to-fine controller,
where trajectories initially begin with classical motion planning based on pose
estimation, and transition to an end-to-end controller which maps images to
actions and is trained in simulation with domain randomisation. In this way, we
achieve precise control whilst also generalising the controller across the
workspace and keeping the generality and robustness of vision-based, end-to-end
control. Real-world experiments on a range of different tasks show that, by
exploiting the best of both worlds, our framework significantly outperforms
purely motion planning methods, and purely learning-based methods. Furthermore,
we answer a range of questions on best practices for precise sim-to-real
transfer, such as how different image sensor modalities and image feature
representations perform.</span>

                                        <span>Image-to-image translation aims to preserve source contents while translating
to discriminative target styles between two visual domains. Most works apply
adversarial learning in the ambient image space, which could be computationally
expensive and challenging to train. In this paper, we propose to deploy an
energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder for
this task. The pretrained autoencoder serves as both a latent code extractor
and an image reconstruction worker. Our model, LETIT, is based on the
assumption that two domains share the same latent space, where latent
representation is implicitly decomposed as a content code and a domain-specific
style code. Instead of explicitly extracting the two codes and applying
adaptive instance normalization to combine them, our latent EBM can implicitly
learn to transport the source style code to the target style code while
preserving the content code, an advantage over existing image translation
methods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in the one-sided
unpaired image translation setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons
demonstrate superior translation quality and faithfulness for content
preservation. Our model is the first to be applicable to
1024$\times$1024-resolution unpaired image translation to the best of our
knowledge.</span>

                                        <span>There has been a substantial amount of research involving computer methods
and technology for the detection and recognition of diabetic foot ulcers
(DFUs), but there is a lack of systematic comparisons of state-of-the-art deep
learning object detection frameworks applied to this problem. DFUC2020 provided
participants with a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2,000 images for
training and 2,000 images for testing. This paper summarises the results of
DFUC2020 by comparing the deep learning-based algorithms proposed by the
winning teams: Faster R-CNN, three variants of Faster R-CNN and an ensemble
method; YOLOv3; YOLOv5; EfficientDet; and a new Cascade Attention Network. For
each deep learning method, we provide a detailed description of model
architecture, parameter settings for training and additional stages including
pre-processing, data augmentation and post-processing. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation for each method. All the methods required a data
augmentation stage to increase the number of images available for training and
a post-processing stage to remove false positives. The best performance was
obtained from Deformable Convolution, a variant of Faster R-CNN, with a mean
average precision (mAP) of 0.6940 and an F1-Score of 0.7434. Finally, we
demonstrate that the ensemble method based on different deep learning methods
can enhanced the F1-Score but not the mAP.</span>

                                        <span>Handwritten Text Line Segmentation (HTLS) is a low-level but important task
for many higher-level document processing tasks like handwritten text
recognition. It is often formulated in terms of semantic segmentation or object
detection in deep learning. However, both formulations have serious
shortcomings. The former requires heavy post-processing of splitting/merging
adjacent segments, while the latter may fail on dense or curved texts. In this
paper, we propose a novel Line Counting formulation for HTLS -- that involves
counting the number of text lines from the top at every pixel location. This
formulation helps learn an end-to-end HTLS solution that directly predicts
per-pixel line number for a given document image. Furthermore, we propose a
deep neural network (DNN) model LineCounter to perform HTLS through the Line
Counting formulation. Our extensive experiments on the three public datasets
(ICDAR2013-HSC, HIT-MW, and VML-AHTE) demonstrate that LineCounter outperforms
state-of-the-art HTLS approaches. Source code is available at

images of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. As such, it represents one of
the most promising imaging techniques in structural biology. However, raw
cryo-EM images are only highly corrupted - noisy and band-pass filtered - 2D
projections of the target 3D biomolecules. Reconstructing the 3D molecular
shape starts with the removal of image outliers, the estimation of the
orientation of the biomolecule that has produced the given 2D image, and the
estimation of camera parameters to correct for intensity defects. Current
techniques performing these tasks are often computationally expensive, while
the dataset sizes keep growing. There is a need for next-generation algorithms
that preserve accuracy while improving speed and scalability. In this paper, we
combine variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks
(GANs) to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of cryo-EM images. We
perform an exploratory analysis of the obtained latent space, that is shown to
have a structure of &quot;orbits&quot;, in the sense of Lie group theory, consistent with
the acquisition procedure of cryo-EM images. This analysis leads us to design
an estimation method for orientation and camera parameters of single-particle
cryo-EM images, together with an outliers detection procedure. As such, it
opens the door to geometric approaches for unsupervised estimations of
orientations and camera parameters, making possible fast cryo-EM biomolecule
reconstruction.</span>

segmentation highly challenging, and leads to high inter-rater variability even

occlusion, blur, illumination and scale variance. In this paper, we address
this problem from three aspects by devising an efficient network structure,
proposing three effective training strategies, and exploiting four useful
postprocessing techniques. First, we find that context information plays an
important role in reasoning human body configuration and invisible keypoints.
Inspired by this, we propose a cascaded context mixer (CCM), which efficiently
integrates spatial and channel context information and progressively refines
them. Then, to maximize CCM&#x27;s representation capability, we develop a
hard-negative person detection mining strategy and a joint-training strategy by
exploiting abundant unlabeled data. It enables CCM to learn discriminative
features from massive diverse poses. Third, we present several sub-pixel
refinement techniques for postprocessing keypoint predictions to improve
detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO keypoint detection
benchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over
representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our single model achieves
comparable performance with the winner of the 2018 COCO Keypoint Detection
Challenge. The final ensemble model sets a new SOTA on this benchmark.</span>

by deep neural networks (DNNs). Often, these DNNs are location and time
sensitive, and the parameters of a specific DNN must be delivered from an edge
server to the edge device rapidly and efficiently to carry out time-sensitive
inference tasks. We introduce AirNet, a novel training and analog transmission
method that allows efficient wireless delivery of DNNs. We first train the DNN
with noise injection to counter the wireless channel noise. We also employ
pruning to reduce the channel bandwidth necessary for transmission, and perform
knowledge distillation from a larger model to achieve satisfactory performance,
despite the channel perturbations. We show that AirNet achieves significantly
higher test accuracy compared to digital alternatives under the same bandwidth
and power constraints. It also exhibits graceful degradation with channel
quality, which reduces the requirement for accurate channel estimation.</span>

                                        <span>The creation of altered and manipulated faces has become more common due to
the improvement of DeepFake generation methods. Simultaneously, we have seen
detection models&#x27; development for differentiating between a manipulated and
original face from image or video content. We have observed that most publicly
available DeepFake detection datasets have limited variations, where a single
face is used in many videos, resulting in an oversampled training dataset. Due
to this, deep neural networks tend to overfit to the facial features instead of
learning to detect manipulation features of DeepFake content. As a result, most
detection architectures perform poorly when tested on unseen data. In this
paper, we provide a quantitative analysis to investigate this problem and
present a solution to prevent model overfitting due to the high volume of
samples generated from a small number of actors. We introduce Face-Cutout, a
data augmentation method for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to
improve DeepFake detection. In this method, training images with various
occlusions are dynamically generated using face landmark information
irrespective of orientation. Unlike other general-purpose augmentation methods,
it focuses on the facial information that is crucial for DeepFake detection.
Our method achieves a reduction in LogLoss of 15.2% to 35.3% on different
datasets, compared to other occlusion-based augmentation techniques. We show
that Face-Cutout can be easily integrated with any CNN-based recognition model
and improve detection performance.</span>

interpret. A set of signals are collected and should be classified to identify
the intention of the subject. Different approaches have tried to reduce the
number of channels before sending them to a classifier. We are proposing a deep

Reduction of the number of channels could reduce the complexity of

                                        <span>Existing face restoration researches typically relies on either the
degradation prior or explicit guidance labels for training, which often results
in limited generalization ability over real-world images with heterogeneous
degradations and rich background contents. In this paper, we investigate the
more challenging and practical &quot;dual-blind&quot; version of the problem by lifting
the requirements on both types of prior, termed as &quot;Face Renovation&quot;(FR).
Specifically, we formulated FR as a semantic-guided generation problem and
tackle it with a collaborative suppression and replenishment (CSR) approach.
This leads to HiFaceGAN, a multi-stage framework containing several nested CSR
units that progressively replenish facial details based on the hierarchical
semantic guidance extracted from the front-end content-adaptive suppression
modules. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real face images have
verified the superior performance of HiFaceGAN over a wide range of challenging
restoration subtasks, demonstrating its versatility, robustness and
generalization ability towards real-world face processing applications.</span>

most prominent advantage is the significant reduction of image size allowing
for more efficient storage and transfer. However, lossy compression is
associated with the loss of some image details in favor of reducing its size.
In compressed images, the deficiencies are manifested by noticeable defects in
the form of artifacts; the most common are block artifacts, ringing effect, or
blur. In this article, we propose three models of fully convolutional networks
with different configurations and examine their abilities in reducing
compression artifacts. In the experiments, we research the extent to which the
results are improved for models that will process the image in a similar way to
the compression algorithm, and whether the initialization with predefined

high-dimensional images, especially in terms of memory limits. Existing
approaches either downsample original images, or approximate underlying
transformations, or reduce model size. The information loss during the
approximation or insufficient model capacity is a hindrance to the registration
accuracy for high-dimensional images, e.g., 3D medical volumes. In this paper,
we propose a Dividing and Downsampling mixed Registration network (DDR-Net), a
general architecture that preserves most of the image information at multiple
scales. DDR-Net leverages the global context via downsampling the input and
utilizes the local details from divided chunks of the input images. This design
reduces the network input size and its memory cost; meanwhile, by fusing global
and local information, DDR-Net obtains both coarse-level and fine-level
alignments in the final deformation fields. We evaluate DDR-Net on three public

                                        <span>The rapid increment of morbidity of brain stroke in the last few years have
been a driving force towards fast and accurate segmentation of stroke lesions
from brain MRI images. With the recent development of deep-learning,
computer-aided and segmentation methods of ischemic stroke lesions have been
useful for clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. However, most
of these methods suffer from inaccurate and unreliable segmentation results
because of their inability to capture sufficient contextual features from the
MRI volumes. To meet these requirements, 3D convolutional neural networks have
been proposed, which, however, suffer from huge computational requirements. To
mitigate these problems, we propose a novel Dimension Fusion Edge-guided
network (DFENet) that can meet both of these requirements by fusing the
features of 2D and 3D CNNs. Unlike other methods, our proposed network uses a
parallel partial decoder (PPD) module for aggregating and upsampling selected
features, rich in important contextual information. Additionally, we use an
edge-guidance and enhanced mixing loss for constantly supervising and
improvising the learning process of the network. The proposed method is
evaluated on publicly available Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke
(ATLAS) dataset, resulting in mean DSC, IoU, Precision and Recall values of
0.5457, 0.4015, 0.6371, and 0.4969 respectively. The results, when compared to
other state-of-the-art methods, outperforms them by a significant margin.
Therefore, the proposed model is robust, accurate, superior to the existing
methods, and can be relied upon for biomedical applications.</span>

                                        <span>Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is extremely challenging due
to occlusions, variant head poses, face deformation and motion blur under
unconstrained conditions. Although substantial progresses have been made in
automatic FER in the past few decades, previous studies are mainly designed for
lab-controlled FER. Real-world occlusions, variant head poses and other issues
definitely increase the difficulty of FER on account of these
information-deficient regions and complex backgrounds. Different from previous
pure CNNs based methods, we argue that it is feasible and practical to
translate facial images into sequences of visual words and perform expression
recognition from a global perspective. Therefore, we propose Convolutional
Visual Transformers to tackle FER in the wild by two main steps. First, we
propose an attentional selective fusion (ASF) for leveraging the feature maps
generated by two-branch CNNs. The ASF captures discriminative information by
fusing multiple features with global-local attention. The fused feature maps
are then flattened and projected into sequences of visual words. Second,
inspired by the success of Transformers in natural language processing, we
propose to model relationships between these visual words with global
self-attention. The proposed method are evaluated on three public in-the-wild
facial expression datasets (RAF-DB, FERPlus and AffectNet). Under the same
settings, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows superior
performance over other methods, setting new state of the art on RAF-DB with
88.14%, FERPlus with 88.81% and AffectNet with 61.85%. We also conduct
cross-dataset evaluation on CK+ show the generalization capability of the
proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and
future impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by
estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for
fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To
that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm
density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to
generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of
oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that
covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.
Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves
counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we
propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most
relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the
epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it
possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.
Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily
parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil
palm density map with $10\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of
Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps
have a mean absolute error of $\pm$7.3 trees/$ha$, estimated from an
independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between
different states within a country and compare them to official estimates.
According to our estimates there are, in total, $&gt;1.2$ billion oil palms in
Indonesia covering $&gt;$15 million $ha$, and $&gt;0.5$ billion oil palms in Malaysia
covering $&gt;6$ million $ha$.</span>

that can achieve temporally coherent matting results. Its key component is an
attention-based temporal aggregation module that maximizes image matting
networks&#x27; strength for video matting networks. This module computes temporal
correlations for pixels adjacent to each other along the time axis in feature
space to be robust against motion noises. We also design a novel loss term to
train the attention weights, which drastically boosts the video matting
performance. Besides, we show how to effectively solve the trimap generation
problem by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art video object segmentation network
with a sparse set of user-annotated keyframes. To facilitate video matting and
trimap generation networks&#x27; training, we construct a large-scale video matting
dataset with 80 training and 28 validation foreground video clips with
ground-truth alpha mattes. Experimental results show that our method can
generate high-quality alpha mattes for various videos featuring appearance
change, occlusion, and fast motion. Our code and dataset can be found at

key factors in reducing its mortality is based on early detection. The
computer-aided diagnosis systems for this task are based on the glandular
structural analysis in histology images. Hence, accurate gland detection and
segmentation is crucial for a successful prediction. The methodological basis
of this work is a prostate gland segmentation based on U-Net convolutional

                                        <span>Recent advances in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in the development
of automated skin disease classification. As we observe an increasing interest
in these models in the dermatology space, it is crucial to address aspects such
as the robustness towards input data distribution shifts. Current skin disease
models could make incorrect inferences for test samples from different hardware
devices and clinical settings or unknown disease samples, which are
out-of-distribution (OOD) from the training samples.To this end, we propose a
simple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any
decision. The detection is performed via scanning in the latent space
representation (e.g., activations of the inner layers of any pre-trained skin
disease classifier). The input samples could also perturbed to maximise
divergence of OOD samples. We validate our ODD detection approach in two use
cases: 1) identify samples collected from different protocols, and 2) detect
samples from unknown disease classes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of the proposed approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, data-driven dermatology applications may deepen the disparity in
clinical care across racial and ethnic groups since most datasets are reported
to suffer from bias in skin tone distribution. Therefore, we also evaluate the
fairness of these OOD detection methods across different skin tones. Our
experiments resulted in competitive performance across multiple datasets in
detecting OOD samples, which could be used (in the future) to design more
effective transfer learning techniques prior to inferring on these samples.</span>

localization techniques have achieved great success. However, there are still
existing some problems, such as the source of the action is too single, there
are only sports categories in THUMOS14, coarse instances with uncertain
boundaries in ActivityNet and HACS Segments interfering with proposal
generation and behavior prediction. To take temporal action localization to a
new level, we develop FineAction, a new large-scale fined video dataset
collected from existing video datasets and web videos. Overall, this dataset
contains 139K fined action instances densely annotated in almost 17K untrimmed
videos spanning 106 action categories. FineAction has a more fined definition
of action categories and high-quality annotations to reduce the boundary
uncertainty compared to the existing action localization datasets. We
systematically investigate representative methods of temporal action
localization on our dataset and obtain some interesting findings with further
analysis. Experimental results reveal that our FineAction brings new challenges
for action localization on fined and multi-label instances with shorter
duration. This dataset will be public in the future and we hope our FineAction
could advance research towards temporal action localization. Our dataset

scholars, and stereo matching is its most important sub fields. After the
parallax map is transformed into a depth map, it can be applied to many
intelligent fields. In this paper, a stereo matching algorithm based on visual
sensitive information is proposed by using standard images from Middlebury
dataset. Aiming at the limitation of traditional stereo matching algorithms
regarding the cost window, a cost aggregation algorithm based on the dynamic
window is proposed, and the disparity image is optimized by using left and
right consistency detection to further reduce the error matching rate. The
experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance
the stereo matching effect of the image providing significant improvement in
accuracy as compared with the classical census algorithm. The proposed model

(CNNs) are the state-of-the-art image segmentation technique, but require large
annotated datasets for training. Annotation of 3D medical images is
time-consuming, requires highly-trained raters, and may suffer from high
inter-rater variability. Self-supervised learning strategies can leverage
unlabeled data for training.

We developed an algorithm to simulate resections from preoperative magnetic
resonance images (MRIs). We performed self-supervised training of a 3D CNN for
RC segmentation using our simulation method. We curated EPISURG, a dataset
comprising 430 postoperative and 268 preoperative MRIs from 430 refractory
epilepsy patients who underwent resective neurosurgery. We fine-tuned our model
on three small annotated datasets from different institutions and on the
annotated images in EPISURG, comprising 20, 33, 19 and 133 subjects.

The model trained on data with simulated resections obtained median
(interquartile range) Dice score coefficients (DSCs) of 81.7 (16.4), 82.4
(36.4), 74.9 (24.2) and 80.5 (18.7) for each of the four datasets. After
fine-tuning, DSCs were 89.2 (13.3), 84.1 (19.8), 80.2 (20.1) and 85.2 (10.8).
For comparison, inter-rater agreement between human annotators from our
previous study was 84.0 (9.9).

We present a self-supervised learning strategy for 3D CNNs using simulated
RCs to accurately segment real RCs on postoperative MRI. Our method generalizes
well to data from different institutions, pathologies and modalities. Source

approaches for the identification of pulmonary embolism in CTPA-Scans for
COVID-19 patients, provide an initial assessment of their performance and,
ultimately, provide a fast-track prototype solution (system). We adopted and
assessed some of the most popular convolutional neural network architectures
through transfer learning approaches, to strive to combine good model accuracy
with fast training. Additionally, we exploited one of the most popular
one-stage object detection models for the localization (through object
detection) of the pulmonary embolism regions-of-interests. The models of both
approaches are trained on an original CTPA-Scan dataset, where we annotated of
673 CTPA-Scan images with 1,465 bounding boxes in total, highlighting pulmonary
embolism regions-of-interests. We provide a brief assessment of some
state-of-the-art image classification models by achieving validation accuracies
of 91% in pulmonary embolism classification. Additionally, we achieved a
precision of about 68% on average in the object detection model for the
pulmonary embolism localization under 50% IoU threshold. For both approaches,
we provide the entire training pipelines for future studies (step by step
processes through source code). In this study, we present some of the most
accurate and fast deep learning models for pulmonary embolism identification in
CTPA-Scans images, through classification and localization (object detection)
approaches for patients infected by COVID-19. We provide a fast-track solution
(system) for the research community of the area, which combines both
classification and object detection models for improving the precision of
identifying pulmonary embolisms.</span>

                                        <span>In contrast to the oriented bounding boxes, point set representation has
great potential to capture the detailed structure of instances with the
arbitrary orientations, large aspect ratios and dense distribution in aerial
images. However, the conventional point set-based approaches are handcrafted
with the fixed locations using points-to-points supervision, which hurts their
flexibility on the fine-grained feature extraction. To address these
limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to aerial object
detection, named Oriented RepPoints. Specifically, we suggest to employ a set
of adaptive points to capture the geometric and spatial information of the
arbitrary-oriented objects, which is able to automatically arrange themselves
over the object in a spatial and semantic scenario. To facilitate the
supervised learning, the oriented conversion function is proposed to explicitly
map the adaptive point set into an oriented bounding box. Moreover, we
introduce an effective quality assessment measure to select the point set
samples for training, which can choose the representative items with respect to
their potentials on orientated object detection. Furthermore, we suggest a
spatial constraint to penalize the outlier points outside the ground-truth
bounding box. In addition to the traditional evaluation metric mAP focusing on
overlap ratio, we propose a new metric mAOE to measure the orientation accuracy
that is usually neglected in the previous studies on oriented object detection.
Experiments on three widely used datasets including DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD
demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective.</span>

evaluated on testing data under different distributions from training data.
Domain generalization aims at tackling this problem by learning transferable
knowledge from multiple source domains in order to generalize to unseen target
domains. This paper introduces a novel Fourier-based perspective for domain
generalization. The main assumption is that the Fourier phase information
contains high-level semantics and is not easily affected by domain shifts. To
force the model to capture phase information, we develop a novel Fourier-based
data augmentation strategy called amplitude mix which linearly interpolates
between the amplitude spectrums of two images. A dual-formed consistency loss
called co-teacher regularization is further introduced between the predictions
induced from original and augmented images. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to achieve
state-of-the-arts performance for domain generalization.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, most siamese network based trackers locate targets via object
classification and bounding-box regression. Generally, they select the
bounding-box with maximum classification confidence as the final prediction.
This strategy may miss the right result due to the accuracy misalignment
between classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
siamese tracking algorithm called SiamRCR, addressing this problem with a
simple, light and effective solution. It builds reciprocal links between
classification and regression branches, which can dynamically re-weight their
losses for each positive sample. In addition, we add a localization branch to
predict the localization accuracy, so that it can work as the replacement of
the regression assistance link during inference. This branch makes the training
and inference more consistent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of SiamRCR and its superiority over the state-of-the-art
competitors on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OTB-2015, VOT-2018 and VOT-2019.
Moreover, our SiamRCR runs at 65 FPS, far above the real-time requirement.</span>

                                        <span>Puck localization is an important problem in ice hockey video analytics
useful for analyzing the game, determining play location, and assessing puck
possession. The problem is challenging due to the small size of the puck,
excessive motion blur due to high puck velocity and occlusions due to players
and boards. In this paper, we introduce and implement a network for puck
localization in broadcast hockey video. The network leverages expert NHL
play-by-play annotations and uses temporal context to locate the puck. Player
locations are incorporated into the network through an attention mechanism by
encoding player positions with a Gaussian-based spatial heatmap drawn at player
positions. Since event occurrence on the rink and puck location are related, we
also perform event recognition by augmenting the puck localization network with
an event recognition head and training the network through multi-task learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the network is able to localize the puck
with an AUC of $73.1 \%$ on the test set. The puck location can be inferred in
720p broadcast videos at $5$ frames per second. It is also demonstrated that
multi-task learning with puck location improves event recognition accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Video prediction is a challenging task with wide application prospects in
meteorology and robot systems. Existing works fail to trade off short-term and
long-term prediction performances and extract robust latent dynamics laws in
video frames. We propose a two-branch seq-to-seq deep model to disentangle the
Taylor feature and the residual feature in video frames by a novel recurrent
prediction module (TaylorCell) and residual module. TaylorCell can expand the
video frames&#x27; high-dimensional features into the finite Taylor series to
describe the latent laws. In TaylorCell, we propose the Taylor prediction unit
(TPU) and the memory correction unit (MCU). TPU employs the first input frame&#x27;s
derivative information to predict the future frames, avoiding error
accumulation. MCU distills all past frames&#x27; information to correct the
predicted Taylor feature from TPU. Correspondingly, the residual module
extracts the residual feature complementary to the Taylor feature. On three
generalist datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human 3.6), our model outperforms or
reaches state-of-the-art models, and ablation experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in long-term prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Time of flight based Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging approaches require
precise calibration of illumination and detector positions on the visible scene
to produce reasonable results. If this calibration error is sufficiently high,
reconstruction can fail entirely without any indication to the user. In this
work, we highlight the necessity of building autocalibration into NLOS
reconstruction in order to handle mis-calibration. We propose a forward model
of NLOS measurements that is differentiable with respect to both, the hidden
scene albedo, and virtual illumination and detector positions. With only a mean
squared error loss and no regularization, our model enables joint
reconstruction and recovery of calibration parameters by minimizing the
measurement residual using gradient descent. We demonstrate our method is able
to produce robust reconstructions using simulated and real data where the
calibration error applied causes other state of the art algorithms to fail.</span>

                                        <span>3D ultrasound (US) has become prevalent due to its rich spatial and
diagnostic information not contained in 2D US. Moreover, 3D US can contain
multiple standard planes (SPs) in one shot. Thus, automatically localizing SPs
in 3D US has the potential to improve user-independence and
scanning-efficiency. However, manual SP localization in 3D US is challenging
because of the low image quality, huge search space and large anatomical
variability. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) framework to simultaneously localize multiple SPs in 3D US. Our
contribution is four-fold. First, our proposed method is general and it can
accurately localize multiple SPs in different challenging US datasets. Second,
we equip the MARL system with a recurrent neural network (RNN) based
collaborative module, which can strengthen the communication among agents and
learn the spatial relationship among planes effectively. Third, we explore to
adopt the neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically design the network
architecture of both the agents and the collaborative module. Last, we believe
we are the first to realize automatic SP localization in pelvic US volumes, and
note that our approach can handle both normal and abnormal uterus cases.
Extensively validated on two challenging datasets of the uterus and fetal
brain, our proposed method achieves the average localization accuracy of 7.03
degrees/1.59mm and 9.75 degrees/1.19mm. Experimental results show that our
light-weight MARL model has higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.</span>

with small mobile robots and machine-vision algorithms. Our results show that
the machine-vision based soybean pod counts are strongly correlated with
soybean yield. While pod counts has a strong correlation with soybean yield,
pod counting is extremely labor intensive, and has been difficult to automate.
Our results establish that an autonomous robot equipped with vision sensors can
autonomously collect soybean data at maturity. Machine-vision algorithms can be
used to estimate pod-counts across a large diversity panel planted across
experimental units (EUs, or plots) in a high-throughput, automated manner. We
report a correlation of 0.67 between our automated pod counts and soybean
yield. The data was collected in an experiment consisting of 1463 single-row
plots maintained by the University of Illinois soybean breeding program during
the 2020 growing season. We also report a correlation of 0.88 between automated

availability of both a teacher model and ground-truth labels. We propose a new
perspective to relax this constraint. In our framework, a student is first
trained with pseudo labels generated by the teacher, and then fine-tuned using
labeled data, if any available. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements
over existing object detection distillation algorithms. In addition, decoupling
the teacher and ground-truth distillation in this framework provides
interesting properties such: as 1) using unlabeled data to further improve the
student&#x27;s performance, 2) combining multiple teacher models of different
architectures, even with different object categories, and 3) reducing the need
for labeled data (with only 20% of COCO labels, this method achieves the same
performance as the model trained on the entire set of labels). Furthermore, a
by-product of this approach is the potential usage for domain adaptation. We
verify these properties through extensive experiments.</span>

                                        <span>Any large complex data analysis to infer or discover meaningful
information/knowledge involves the following steps (in addition to data
collection, cleaning, preparing the data for analysis such as attribute
elimination): i) Modeling the data -- an approach for modeling and deriving a
data representation for analysis using that approach, ii) translating analysis
objectives into computations on the model generated; this can be as simple as a
single computation (e.g., community detection) or may involve a sequence of
operations (e.g., pair-wise community detection over multiple networks) using
expressions based on the model, iii) computation of the expressions generated
-- efficiency and scalability come into picture here, and iv) drill-down of
results to interpret or understand them clearly. Beyond this, it is also
meaningful to visualize results for easier understanding. Covid-19
visualization dashboard presented in this paper is an example of this.

This paper covers all of the above steps of data analysis life cycle using a
data representation that is gaining importance for multi-entity, multi-feature
data sets - Multilayer Networks. We use several data sets to establish the
effectiveness of modeling using MLNs and analyze them using the proposed
decoupling approach. For coverage, we use different types of MLNs for modeling,
and community and centrality computations for analysis. The data sets used - US
commercial airlines, IMDb, DBLP, and Covid-19 data set. Our experimental
analyses using the identified steps validate modeling, breadth of objectives
that can be computed, and overall versatility of the life cycle approach.
Correctness of results is verified, where possible, using independently
available ground truth. We demonstrate drill-down that is afforded by this
approach (due to structure and semantics preservation) for a better
understanding and visualization of results.</span>

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective technique for training
decision-making agents through interactions with their environment. The advent
of deep learning has been associated with highly notable successes with
sequential decision making problems - such as defeating some of the
highest-ranked human players at Go. In digital advertising, real-time bidding
(RTB) is a common method of allocating advertising inventory through real-time
auctions. Bidding strategies need to incorporate logic for dynamically
adjusting parameters in order to deliver pre-assigned campaign goals. Here we
discuss techniques toward using RL to train bidding agents. As a campaign
metric we particularly focused on viewability: the percentage of inventory
which goes on to be viewed by an end user.

This paper is presented as a survey of techniques and experiments which we
developed through the course of this research. We discuss expanding our
training data to include edge cases by training on simulated interactions. We
discuss the experimental results comparing the performance of several promising
RL algorithms, and an approach to hyperparameter optimization of an
actor/critic training pipeline through Bayesian optimization. Finally, we
present live-traffic tests of some of our RL agents against a rule-based
feedback-control approach, demonstrating the potential for this method as well
as areas for further improvement. This paper therefore presents an arrangement
of our findings in this quickly developing field, and ways that it can be
applied to an RTB use case.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems usually amplify the biases in the data. The model learned
from historical interactions with imbalanced item distribution will amplify the
imbalance by over-recommending items from the major groups. Addressing this
issue is essential for a healthy ecosystem of recommendation in the long run.
Existing works apply bias control to the ranking targets (e.g., calibration,
fairness, and diversity), but ignore the true reason for bias amplification and
trade-off the recommendation accuracy.

In this work, we scrutinize the cause-effect factors for bias amplification,
identifying the main reason lies in the confounder effect of imbalanced item
distribution on user representation and prediction score. The existence of such
confounder pushes us to go beyond merely modeling the conditional probability
and embrace the causal modeling for recommendation. Towards this end, we
propose a Deconfounded Recommender System (DecRS), which models the causal
effect of user representation on the prediction score. The key to eliminating
the impact of the confounder lies in backdoor adjustment, which is however
difficult to do due to the infinite sample space of the confounder. For this
challenge, we contribute an approximation operator for backdoor adjustment
which can be easily plugged into most recommender models. Lastly, we devise an
inference strategy to dynamically regulate backdoor adjustment according to
user status. We instantiate DecRS on two representative models FM and NFM, and
conduct extensive experiments over two benchmarks to validate the superiority
of our proposed DecRS.</span>

expanded from professional, editor-lead journalism all the way to citizen
journalism. Nowadays, politicians and other key players enjoy direct access to
their audiences through social media, bypassing the filters of official cables
or traditional media. However, the multiple advantages of free speech and
direct communication are dimmed by the misuse of media to spread inaccurate or
misleading claims. These phenomena have led to the modern incarnation of the
fact-checker -- a professional whose main aim is to examine claims using
available evidence and to assess their veracity. As in other text forensics
tasks, the amount of information available makes the work of the fact-checker
more difficult. With this in mind, starting from the perspective of the
professional fact-checker, we survey the available intelligent technologies
that can support the human expert in the different steps of her fact-checking
endeavor. These include identifying claims worth fact-checking, detecting
relevant previously fact-checked claims, retrieving relevant evidence to
fact-check a claim, and actually verifying a claim. In each case, we pay
attention to the challenges in future work and the potential impact on
real-world fact-checking.</span>

state-of-the-art Transformer models. But is it really required? This paper
investigates the true importance and contribution of the dot product-based
self-attention mechanism on the performance of Transformer models. Via
extensive experiments, we find that (1) random alignment matrices surprisingly
perform quite competitively and (2) learning attention weights from token-token
(query-key) interactions is useful but not that important after all. To this
end, we propose \textsc{Synthesizer}, a model that learns synthetic attention
weights without token-token interactions. In our experiments, we first show
that simple Synthesizers achieve highly competitive performance when compared
against vanilla Transformer models across a range of tasks, including machine
translation, language modeling, text generation and GLUE/SuperGLUE benchmarks.
When composed with dot product attention, we find that Synthesizers
consistently outperform Transformers. Moreover, we conduct additional
comparisons of Synthesizers against Dynamic Convolutions, showing that simple
Random Synthesizer is not only $60\%$ faster but also improves perplexity by a
relative $3.5\%$. Finally, we show that simple factorized Synthesizers can
outperform Linformers on encoding only tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Deep matching models aim to facilitate search engines retrieving more
relevant documents by mapping queries and documents into semantic vectors in
the first-stage retrieval. When leveraging BERT as the deep matching model, the
attention score across two words are solely built upon local contextualized
word embeddings. It lacks prior global knowledge to distinguish the importance
of different words, which has been proved to play a critical role in
information retrieval tasks. In addition to this, BERT only performs attention
across sub-words tokens which weakens whole word attention representation. We
propose a novel Global Weighted Self-Attention (GLOW) network for web document
search. GLOW fuses global corpus statistics into the deep matching model. By
adding prior weights into attention generation from global information, like
BM25, GLOW successfully learns weighted attention scores jointly with query
matrix $Q$ and key matrix $K$. We also present an efficient whole word weight
sharing solution to bring prior whole word knowledge into sub-words level
attention. It aids Transformer to learn whole word level attention. To make our
models applicable to complicated web search scenarios, we introduce combined
fields representation to accommodate documents with multiple fields even with
variable number of instances. We demonstrate GLOW is more efficient to capture
the topical and semantic representation both in queries and documents.
Intrinsic evaluation and experiments conducted on public data sets reveal GLOW
to be a general framework for document retrieve task. It significantly
outperforms BERT and other competitive baselines by a large margin while
retaining the same model complexity with BERT.</span>

                                        <span>Recommendation is a prevalent and critical service in information systems. To
provide personalized suggestions to users, industry players embrace machine
learning, more specifically, building predictive models based on the click
behavior data. This is known as the Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, which
has become the gold standard for building personalized recommendation service.
However, we argue that there is a significant gap between clicks and user
satisfaction -- it is common that a user is &quot;cheated&quot; to click an item by the
attractive title/cover of the item. This will severely hurt user&#x27;s trust on the
system if the user finds the actual content of the clicked item disappointing.
What&#x27;s even worse, optimizing CTR models on such flawed data will result in the
Matthew Effect, making the seemingly attractive but actually low-quality items
be more frequently recommended.

In this paper, we formulate the recommendation models as a causal graph that
reflects the cause-effect factors in recommendation, and address the clickbait
issue by performing counterfactual inference on the causal graph. We imagine a
counterfactual world where each item has only exposure features (i.e., the
features that the user can see before making a click decision). By estimating
the click likelihood of a user in the counterfactual world, we are able to
reduce the direct effect of exposure features and eliminate the clickbait
issue. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the post-click satisfaction of CTR models.</span>

                                        <span>In most real-world large-scale online applications (e.g., e-commerce or
finance), customer acquisition is usually a multi-step conversion process of
audiences. For example, an impression-&gt;click-&gt;purchase process is usually
performed of audiences for e-commerce platforms. However, it is more difficult
to acquire customers in financial advertising (e.g., credit card advertising)
than in traditional advertising. On the one hand, the audience multi-step
conversion path is longer. On the other hand, the positive feedback is sparser
(class imbalance) step by step, and it is difficult to obtain the final
positive feedback due to the delayed feedback of activation. Multi-task
learning is a typical solution in this direction. While considerable multi-task
efforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing challenge is how to
explicitly model the long-path sequential dependence among audience multi-step
conversions for improving the end-to-end conversion. In this paper, we propose
an Adaptive Information Transfer Multi-task (AITM) framework, which models the
sequential dependence among audience multi-step conversions via the Adaptive
Information Transfer (AIT) module. The AIT module can adaptively learn what and
how much information to transfer for different conversion stages. Besides, by
combining the Behavioral Expectation Calibrator in the loss function, the AITM
framework can yield more accurate end-to-end conversion identification. The
proposed framework is deployed in Meituan app, which utilizes it to real-timely
show a banner to the audience with a high end-to-end conversion rate for
Meituan Co-Branded Credit Cards. Offline experimental results on both
industrial and public real-world datasets clearly demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves significantly better performance compared with
state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Learning to rank is a key component of many e-commerce search engines. In
learning to rank, one is interested in optimising the global ordering of a list
of items according to their utility for users.Popular approaches learn a
scoring function that scores items individually (i.e. without the context of
other items in the list) by optimising a pointwise, pairwise or listwise loss.
The list is then sorted in the descending order of the scores. Possible
interactions between items present in the same list are taken into account in
the training phase at the loss level. However, during inference, items are
scored individually, and possible interactions between them are not considered.
In this paper, we propose a context-aware neural network model that learns item
scores by applying a self-attention mechanism. The relevance of a given item is
thus determined in the context of all other items present in the list, both in
training and in inference. We empirically demonstrate significant performance
gains of self-attention based neural architecture over Multi-LayerPerceptron
baselines, in particular on a dataset coming from search logs of a large scale
e-commerce marketplace, Allegro.pl. This effect is consistent across popular
pointwise, pairwise and listwise losses.Finally, we report new state-of-the-art
results on MSLR-WEB30K, the learning to rank benchmark.</span>

participation in the shared task namely Artificial Intelligence for Legal
Assistance (AILA 2019). This is an integral event of Forum for Information
Retrieval Evaluation-2019. The outcomes of this track would be helpful for the
automation of the working process of the Indian Judiciary System. The manual
working procedures and documentation at any level (from lower to higher court)
of the judiciary system are very complex in nature. The systems produced as a
part of this track would assist the law practitioners. It would be helpful for
common men too. This kind of track also opens the path of research of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in the judicial domain. This track defined two
problems such as Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation
and Task 2: Identifying the most relevant statutes for a given situation. We
tackled both of them. Our proposed approaches are based on BM25 and Doc2Vec. As
per the results declared by the task organizers, we are in 3rd and a modest
position in Task 1 and Task 2 respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is critical for industrial recommender
systems, where most deep CTR models follow an Embedding \&amp; Feature Interaction
paradigm. However, the majority of methods focus on designing network
architectures to better capture feature interactions while the feature
embedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing
approaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative
knowledge because of the low capacity or hard discretization based on the
offline expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel
embedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis)
with high model capacity, end-to-end training and unique representation
properties preserved. AutoDis consists of three core components:
meta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we
propose meta-embeddings for each numerical field to learn global knowledge from
the perspective of field with a manageable number of parameters. Then the
differentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and
captures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings.
Finally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation
function. Comprehensive experiments on two public and one industrial datasets
are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoDis. Moreover, AutoDis has
been deployed onto a mainstream advertising platform, where online A/B test
demonstrates the improvement over the base model by 2.1% and 2.7% in terms of
CTR and eCPM, respectively. In addition, the code of our framework is publicly
available in

                                        <span>Sequential recommendation techniques provide users with product
recommendations fitting their current preferences by handling dynamic user
preferences over time. Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential
dynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head
items) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We
scrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the
current sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding
layer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed
sequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn
suitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this
expectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning
high-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely
recommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES,
which aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an
embedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the
recommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for
the head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without
an additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves
recommendation performance for both tail and head items. We conduct an
additional experiment to verify that CITIES can infer suitable new-item
embeddings as well.</span>

                                        <span>Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithms are usually evaluated using Information
Retrieval metrics like Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) or Mean
Average Precision. As these metrics rely on sorting predicted items&#x27; scores
(and thus, on items&#x27; ranks), their derivatives are either undefined or zero
everywhere. This makes them unsuitable for gradient-based optimisation, which
is the usual method of learning appropriate scoring functions. Commonly used
LTR loss functions are only loosely related to the evaluation metrics, causing
a mismatch between the optimisation objective and the evaluation criterion. In
this paper, we address this mismatch by proposing NeuralNDCG, a novel
differentiable approximation to NDCG. Since NDCG relies on the
non-differentiable sorting operator, we obtain NeuralNDCG by relaxing that
operator using NeuralSort, a differentiable approximation of sorting. As a
result, we obtain a new ranking loss function which is an arbitrarily accurate
approximation to the evaluation metric, thus closing the gap between the
training and the evaluation of LTR models. We introduce two variants of the
proposed loss function. Finally, the empirical evaluation shows that our
proposed method outperforms previous work aimed at direct optimisation of NDCG
and is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we investigate the task of aggregating search results from
heterogeneous sources in an E-commerce environment. First, unlike traditional
aggregated web search that merely presents multi-sourced results in the first
page, this new task may present aggregated results in all pages and has to
dynamically decide which source should be presented in the current page.
Second, as pointed out by many existing studies, it is not trivial to rank
items from heterogeneous sources because the relevance scores from different
source systems are not directly comparable. To address these two issues, we
decompose the task into two subtasks in a hierarchical structure: a high-level
task for source selection where we model the sequential patterns of user
behaviors onto aggregated results in different pages so as to understand user
intents and select the relevant sources properly; and a low-level task for item
presentation where we formulate a slot filling process to sequentially present
the items instead of giving each item a relevance score when deciding the
presentation order of heterogeneous items. Since both subtasks can be naturally
formulated as sequential decision problems and learn from the future user
feedback on search results, we build our model with hierarchical reinforcement
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model obtains remarkable
improvements in search performance metrics, and achieves a higher user
satisfaction.</span>

                                        <span>Event Detection (ED) aims to identify event trigger words from a given text
and classify it into an event type. Most of current methods to ED rely heavily
on training instances, and almost ignore the correlation of event types. Hence,
they tend to suffer from data scarcity and fail to handle new unseen event
types. To address these problems, we formulate ED as a process of event
ontology population: linking event instances to pre-defined event types in
event ontology, and propose a novel ED framework entitled OntoED with ontology
embedding. We enrich event ontology with linkages among event types, and
further induce more event-event correlations. Based on the event ontology,
OntoED can leverage and propagate correlation knowledge, particularly from
data-rich to data-poor event types. Furthermore, OntoED can be applied to new
unseen event types, by establishing linkages to existing ones. Experiments
indicate that OntoED is more predominant and robust than previous approaches to
ED, especially in data-scarce scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>As the heart of a search engine, the ranking system plays a crucial role in
satisfying users&#x27; information demands. More recently, neural rankers fine-tuned
from pre-trained language models (PLMs) establish state-of-the-art ranking
effectiveness. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLM-based
rankers to the large-scale web search system due to the following challenging
issues:(1) the prohibitively expensive computations of massive neural PLMs,
especially for long texts in the web-document, prohibit their deployments in an
online ranking system that demands extremely low latency;(2) the discrepancy
between existing ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the ad-hoc
retrieval scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling is another
main barrier for improving the online ranking system;(3) a real-world search
engine typically involves a committee of ranking components, and thus the
compatibility of the individually fine-tuned ranking model is critical for a
cooperative ranking system. In this work, we contribute a series of
successfully applied techniques in tackling these exposed issues when deploying
the state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained language model, i.e., ERNIE, in the
online search engine system. We first articulate a novel practice to
cost-efficiently summarize the web document and contextualize the resultant
summary content with the query using a cheap yet powerful Pyramid-ERNIE
architecture. Then we endow an innovative paradigm to finely exploit the
large-scale noisy and biased post-click behavioral data for relevance-oriented
pre-training. We also propose a human-anchored fine-tuning strategy tailored
for the online ranking system, aiming to stabilize the ranking signals across
various online components. Extensive offline and online experimental results
show that the proposed techniques significantly boost the search engine&#x27;s
performance.</span>

Network (ANN) for solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE)
of either fractional or ordinary orders. Firstly, a discretization method is
employed to change the model into a sequence of Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODE). Then each of these ODEs is solved with the aid of an ANN. Adam
optimization is employed as the learning paradigm since it can add the
foreknowledge of slowing down the process of optimization when getting close to
the actual optimum solution. The model also takes advantage of fine tuning for
speeding up the process and domain mapping to confront infinite domain issue.
Finally, the accuracy, speed, and convergence of the method for solving several
types of Black-Scholes model are reported.</span>

reasonable and accurate model without considering the complex physical

model is validated with the simulation results from TCAD simulation. The
trained SET pulse current model is implemented as a Verilog-A current source in

                                        <span>Policy optimization, which learns the policy of interest by maximizing the
value function via large-scale optimization techniques, lies at the heart of
modern reinforcement learning (RL). In addition to value maximization, other
practical considerations arise commonly as well, including the need of
encouraging exploration, and that of ensuring certain structural properties of
the learned policy due to safety, resource and operational constraints. These
considerations can often be accounted for by resorting to regularized RL, which
augments the target value function with a structure-promoting regularization
term.

Focusing on an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process, this
paper proposes a generalized policy mirror descent (GPMD) algorithm for solving
regularized RL. As a generalization of policy mirror descent Lan (2021), the
proposed algorithm accommodates a general class of convex regularizers as well
as a broad family of Bregman divergence in cognizant of the regularizer in use.
We demonstrate that our algorithm converges linearly over an entire range of
learning rates, in a dimension-free fashion, to the global solution, even when
the regularizer lacks strong convexity and smoothness. In addition, this linear
convergence feature is provably stable in the face of inexact policy evaluation
and imperfect policy updates. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate
the applicability and appealing performance of GPMD.</span>

noiseless label at a given, fixed cost, and aim to achieve the best
generalization performance for given classifier under a budget constraint.
However, in many real settings, different labelers have different labeling
costs and can yield different labeling accuracies. Moreover, a given labeler
may exhibit different labeling accuracies for different instances. This setting
can be referred to as active learning with diverse labelers with varying costs
and accuracies, and it arises in many important real settings. It is therefore
beneficial to understand how to effectively trade-off between labeling accuracy
for different instances, labeling costs, as well as the informativeness of
training instances, so as to achieve the best generalization performance at the
lowest labeling cost. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for selecting
instances, labelers (and their corresponding costs and labeling accuracies),
that employs generalization bound of learning with label noise to select
informative instances and labelers so as to achieve higher generalization
accuracy at a lower cost. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on five UCI and a real crowdsourcing dataset.</span>

learning from a few examples, but prior work uses many held-out examples to
tune various aspects of learning, such as hyperparameters, training objectives,
and natural language templates (&quot;prompts&quot;). Here, we evaluate the few-shot
ability of LMs when such held-out examples are unavailable, a setting we call
true few-shot learning. We test two model selection criteria, cross-validation
and minimum description length, for choosing LM prompts and hyperparameters in
the true few-shot setting. On average, both marginally outperform random
selection and greatly underperform selection based on held-out examples.
Moreover, selection criteria often prefer models that perform significantly
worse than randomly-selected ones. We find similar results even when taking
into account our uncertainty in a model&#x27;s true performance during selection, as
well as when varying the amount of computation and number of examples used for
selection. Overall, our findings suggest that prior work significantly
overestimated the true few-shot ability of LMs given the difficulty of few-shot

                                        <span>Recent unsupervised machine translation (UMT) systems usually employ three
main principles: initialization, language modeling and iterative
back-translation, though they may apply them differently. Crucially, iterative
back-translation and denoising auto-encoding for language modeling provide data
diversity to train the UMT systems. However, the gains from these
diversification processes has seemed to plateau. We introduce a novel component
to the standard UMT framework called Cross-model Back-translated Distillation
(CBD), that is aimed to induce another level of data diversification that
existing principles lack. CBD is applicable to all previous UMT approaches. In
our experiments, CBD achieves the state of the art in the WMT&#x27;14
English-French, WMT&#x27;16 English-German and English-Romanian bilingual
unsupervised translation tasks, with 38.2, 30.1, and 36.3 BLEU respectively. It
also yields 1.5-3.3 BLEU improvements in IWSLT English-French and
English-German tasks. Through extensive experimental analyses, we show that CBD
is effective because it embraces data diversity while other similar variants do

                                        <span>Despite seminal advances in reinforcement learning in recent years, many
domains where the rewards are sparse, e.g. given only at task completion,
remain quite challenging. In such cases, it can be beneficial to tackle the
task both from its beginning and end, and make the two ends meet. Existing
approaches that do so, however, are not effective in the common scenario where
the strategy needed near the end goal is very different from the one that is
effective earlier on.

In this work we propose a novel RL approach for such settings. In short, we
first train a backward-looking agent with a simple relaxed goal, and then
augment the state representation of the forward-looking agent with
straightforward hint features. This allows the learned forward agent to
leverage information from backward plans, without mimicking their policy.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the challenging game of
Sokoban, where we substantially surpass learned solvers that generalize across
levels, and are competitive with SOTA performance of the best highly-crafted
systems. Impressively, we achieve these results while learning from a small
number of practice levels and using simple RL techniques.</span>

                                        <span>SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus, is a viral contagious
disease that is infected by a novel coronavirus, and has been rapidly spreading
across the globe. It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce
spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently.
According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is
the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer
vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can
predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The
accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such
as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of
data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease
is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the
available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by
utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and
negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded
that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19
positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based
classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater
accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and
future impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by
estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for
fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To
that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm
density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to
generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of
oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that
covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.
Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves
counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we
propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most
relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the
epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it
possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.
Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily
parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil
palm density map with $10\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of
Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps
have a mean absolute error of $\pm$7.3 trees/$ha$, estimated from an
independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between
different states within a country and compare them to official estimates.
According to our estimates there are, in total, $&gt;1.2$ billion oil palms in
Indonesia covering $&gt;$15 million $ha$, and $&gt;0.5$ billion oil palms in Malaysia
covering $&gt;6$ million $ha$.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in the development
of automated skin disease classification. As we observe an increasing interest
in these models in the dermatology space, it is crucial to address aspects such
as the robustness towards input data distribution shifts. Current skin disease
models could make incorrect inferences for test samples from different hardware
devices and clinical settings or unknown disease samples, which are
out-of-distribution (OOD) from the training samples.To this end, we propose a
simple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any
decision. The detection is performed via scanning in the latent space
representation (e.g., activations of the inner layers of any pre-trained skin
disease classifier). The input samples could also perturbed to maximise
divergence of OOD samples. We validate our ODD detection approach in two use
cases: 1) identify samples collected from different protocols, and 2) detect
samples from unknown disease classes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of the proposed approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, data-driven dermatology applications may deepen the disparity in
clinical care across racial and ethnic groups since most datasets are reported
to suffer from bias in skin tone distribution. Therefore, we also evaluate the
fairness of these OOD detection methods across different skin tones. Our
experiments resulted in competitive performance across multiple datasets in
detecting OOD samples, which could be used (in the future) to design more
effective transfer learning techniques prior to inferring on these samples.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning models are widely used for image analysis. While they offer
high performance in terms of accuracy, people are concerned about if these
models inappropriately make inferences using irrelevant features that are not
encoded from the target object in a given image. To address the concern, we
propose a metamorphic testing approach that assesses if a given inference is
made based on irrelevant features. Specifically, we propose two novel
metamorphic relations to detect such inappropriate inferences. We applied our
approach to 10 image classification models and 10 object detection models, with
three large datasets, i.e., ImageNet, COCO, and Pascal VOC. Over 5.3% of the
top-5 correct predictions made by the image classification models are subject
to inappropriate inferences using irrelevant features. The corresponding rate
for the object detection models is over 8.5%. Based on the findings, we further
designed a new image generation strategy that can effectively attack existing
models. Comparing with a baseline approach, our strategy can double the success
rate of attacks.</span>

                                        <span>Video prediction is a challenging task with wide application prospects in
meteorology and robot systems. Existing works fail to trade off short-term and
long-term prediction performances and extract robust latent dynamics laws in
video frames. We propose a two-branch seq-to-seq deep model to disentangle the
Taylor feature and the residual feature in video frames by a novel recurrent
prediction module (TaylorCell) and residual module. TaylorCell can expand the
video frames&#x27; high-dimensional features into the finite Taylor series to
describe the latent laws. In TaylorCell, we propose the Taylor prediction unit
(TPU) and the memory correction unit (MCU). TPU employs the first input frame&#x27;s
derivative information to predict the future frames, avoiding error
accumulation. MCU distills all past frames&#x27; information to correct the
predicted Taylor feature from TPU. Correspondingly, the residual module
extracts the residual feature complementary to the Taylor feature. On three
generalist datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human 3.6), our model outperforms or
reaches state-of-the-art models, and ablation experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in long-term prediction.</span>

appliance-level load signals. Many deep learning-based methods have been
developed to accomplish NILM, and the training of deep neural networks (DNN)
requires massive load data containing different types of appliances. For local
data owners with inadequate load data but expect to accomplish a promising
model performance, the conduction of effective NILM co-modelling is
increasingly significant. While during the cooperation of local data owners,
data exchange and centralized data storage may increase the risk of power
consumer privacy breaches. To eliminate the potential risks, a novel NILM

paper. In Fed-NILM, local parameters instead of load data are shared among
local data owners. The global model is obtained by weighted averaging the
parameters. In the experiments, Fed-NILM is validated on two real-world

dominant wave periods in oceanic waters. First, we use the data collected from
CDIP buoys and apply various data filtering methods. The data filtering methods
allow us to obtain a high-quality dataset for training and validation purposes.
We then extract various wave-based features like wave heights, periods,
skewness, kurtosis, etc., and atmospheric features like humidity, pressure, and
air temperature for the buoys. Afterward, we train algorithms that use LightGBM
and Extra Trees through a hv-block cross-validation scheme to forecast dominant
wave periods for up to 30 days ahead. LightGBM has the R2 score of 0.94, 0.94,
and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. Similarly,
Extra Trees (ET) has an R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day ahead,
15-day ahead, and 30 day ahead prediction. In case of the test dataset,
LightGBM has R2 score of 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead and
30-day ahead prediction. ET has R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day

training and the test dataset suggests that the machine learning models
developed in this paper are robust. Since the LightGBM algorithm outperforms ET
for all the windows tested, it is taken as the final algorithm. Note that the
performance of both methods does not decrease significantly as the forecast
horizon increases. Likewise, the proposed method outperforms the numerical
approaches included in this paper in the test dataset. For 1 day ahead
prediction, the proposed algorithm has SI, Bias, CC, and RMSE of 0.09, 0.00,
0.97, and 1.78 compared to 0.268, 0.40, 0.63, and 2.18 for the European Centre

other methods in the test dataset.</span>

students learn and practice, which increases their learning efficiency. The
intelligent tutoring system must model learners&#x27; mastery of the knowledge
before providing feedback and advices to learners, so one class of algorithm
called &quot;knowledge tracing&quot; is surely important. This paper proposed Deep
Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (DSAKT) based on the data of PTA, an online
assessment system used by students in many universities in China, to help these
students learn more efficiently. Experimentation on the data of PTA shows that
DSAKT outperforms the other models for knowledge tracing an improvement of AUC
by 2.1% on average, and this model also has a good performance on the ASSIST
dataset.</span>

building a more informative dynamical model of such systems is engraved in
modern science. Results in reconstructing equivalent chaotic dynamical systems
through delay coordinate mappings, Koopman operator based data-driven approach
and reservoir computing methods have shown the possibility of finding model
equations on a new phase space that is relatable to the dynamical system
generating the data. Recently, rigorous results that point to reducing the
functional complexity of the map that describes the dynamics in the new phase
have made the Koopman operator based approach very attractive for data-driven
modeling. However, choosing a set of nonlinear observable functions that can
work for different data sets is an open challenge. We use driven dynamical
systems comparable to that in reservoir computing with the \emph{causal
embedding property} to obtain the right set of observables through which the
dynamics in the new space is made equivalent or topologically conjugate to the
original system. Deep learning methods are used to learn a map that emerges as
a consequence of the topological conjugacy. Besides stability, amenability for
hardware implementations, causal embedding based models provide long-term
consistency even for maps that have failed under previously reported
data-driven or machine learning methods.</span>

                                        <span>As most of the modern astronomical sky surveys produce data faster than
humans can analyze it, Machine Learning (ML) has become a central tool in
Astronomy. Modern ML methods can be characterized as highly resistant to some
experimental errors. However, small changes on the data over long distances or
long periods of time, which cannot be easily detected by statistical methods,
can be harmful to these methods. We develop a new strategy to cope with this
problem, also using ML methods in an innovative way, to identify these
potentially harmful features. We introduce and discuss the notion of Drifting
Features, related with small changes in the properties as measured in the data
features. We use the identification of RRLs in VVV based on an earlier work and
introduce a method for detecting Drifting Features. Our method forces a
classifier to learn the tile of origin of diverse sources (mostly stellar
&#x27;point sources&#x27;), and select the features more relevant to the task of finding
candidates to Drifting Features. We show that this method can efficiently
identify a reduced set of features that contains useful information about the
tile of origin of the sources. For our particular example of detecting RRLs in
VVV, we find that Drifting Features are mostly related to color indices. On the
other hand, we show that, even if we have a clear set of Drifting Features in
our problem, they are mostly insensitive to the identification of RRLs.
Drifting Features can be efficiently identified using ML methods. However, in
our example, removing Drifting Features does not improve the identification of
RRLs.</span>

                                        <span>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims at decomposing the total reading of
the household power consumption into appliance-wise ones, which is beneficial
for consumer behavior analysis as well as energy conservation. NILM based on
deep learning has been a focus of research. To train a better neural network,
it is necessary for the network to be fed with massive data containing various
appliances and reflecting consumer behavior habits. Therefore, data cooperation
among utilities and DNOs (distributed network operators) who own the NILM data
has been increasingly significant. During the cooperation, however, risks of
consumer privacy leakage and losses of data control rights arise. To deal with
the problems above, a framework to improve the performance of NILM with
federated learning (FL) has been set up. In the framework, model weights
instead of the local data are shared among utilities. The global model is
generated by weighted averaging the locally-trained model weights to gather the
locally-trained model information. Optimal model selection help choose the
model which adapts to the data from different domains best. Experiments show
that this proposal improves the performance of local NILM runners. The
performance of this framework is close to that of the centrally-trained model
obtained by the convergent data without privacy protection.</span>

                                        <span>Graph representation learning has achieved great success in many areas,
including e-commerce, chemistry, biology, etc. However, the fundamental problem
of choosing the appropriate dimension of node embedding for a given graph still
remains unsolved. The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension
Selection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy
computation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the
perspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel
Minimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be
specific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs,
which are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich
information in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of
adjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on
graphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to
further measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design
MinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph.
Finally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed MinGE.</span>

                                        <span>This paper studies the traffic state estimation (TSE) problem using sparse
observations from mobile sensors. TSE can be considered a spatiotemporal
interpolation problem in which the evolution of traffic variables (e.g.,
speed/density) is governed by traffic flow dynamics (e.g., partial differential
equations). Most existing TSE methods either rely on well-defined physical
traffic flow models or require large amounts of simulation data as input to
train machine learning models. Different from previous studies, in this paper
we propose a purely data-driven and model-free solution. We consider TSE as a
spatiotemporal matrix completion/interpolation problem, and apply
spatiotemporal Hankel delay embedding to transforms the original incomplete
matrix to a fourth-order tensor. By imposing a low-rank assumption on this
tensor structure, we can approximate and characterize both global patterns and
the unknown and complex local spatiotemporal dynamics in a data-driven manner.
We use the truncated nuclear norm of the spatiotemporal unfolding (i.e., square
norm) to approximate the tensor rank and develop an efficient solution
algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The
proposed framework only involves two hyperparameters -- spatial and temporal
window lengths, which are easy to set given the degree of data sparsity. We
conduct numerical experiments on both synthetic simulation data and real-world
high-resolution trajectory data, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed model in some challenging scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is critical for industrial recommender
systems, where most deep CTR models follow an Embedding \&amp; Feature Interaction
paradigm. However, the majority of methods focus on designing network
architectures to better capture feature interactions while the feature
embedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing
approaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative
knowledge because of the low capacity or hard discretization based on the
offline expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel
embedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis)
with high model capacity, end-to-end training and unique representation
properties preserved. AutoDis consists of three core components:
meta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we
propose meta-embeddings for each numerical field to learn global knowledge from
the perspective of field with a manageable number of parameters. Then the
differentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and
captures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings.
Finally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation
function. Comprehensive experiments on two public and one industrial datasets
are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoDis. Moreover, AutoDis has
been deployed onto a mainstream advertising platform, where online A/B test
demonstrates the improvement over the base model by 2.1% and 2.7% in terms of
CTR and eCPM, respectively. In addition, the code of our framework is publicly
available in
MindSpore(https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/research/recommend/autodis).</span>

                                        <span>Solving tasks with sparse rewards is one of the most important challenges in
reinforcement learning. In the single-agent setting, this challenge is
addressed by introducing intrinsic rewards that motivate agents to explore
unseen regions of their state spaces; however, applying these techniques
naively to the multi-agent setting results in agents exploring independently,
without any coordination among themselves. Exploration in cooperative
multi-agent settings can be accelerated and improved if agents coordinate their
exploration. In this paper we introduce a framework for designing intrinsic
rewards which consider what other agents have explored such that the agents can
coordinate. Then, we develop an approach for learning how to dynamically select
between several exploration modalities to maximize extrinsic rewards.
Concretely, we formulate the approach as a hierarchical policy where a
high-level controller selects among sets of policies trained on diverse
intrinsic rewards and the low-level controllers learn the action policies of
all agents under these specific rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach in cooperative domains with sparse rewards where
state-of-the-art methods fail and challenging multi-stage tasks that
necessitate changing modes of coordination.</span>

surroundings of a self-driving vehicle (SDV) and predicting how these
surroundings will change in the near future. To address this task we propose
MultiXNet, an end-to-end approach for detection and motion prediction based
directly on lidar sensor data. This approach builds on prior work by handling
multiple classes of traffic actors, adding a jointly trained second-stage
trajectory refinement step, and producing a multimodal probability distribution
over future actor motion that includes both multiple discrete traffic behaviors
and calibrated continuous position uncertainties. The method was evaluated on
large-scale, real-world data collected by a fleet of SDVs in several cities,
with the results indicating that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.</span>

stochastic, potentially private rewards, when the goal is to identify the arm
with the highest quantile at a fixed, prescribed level. First, we propose a
(non-private) successive elimination algorithm for strictly optimal best-arm
identification, we show that our algorithm is $\delta$-PAC and we characterize
its sample complexity. Further, we provide a lower bound on the expected number
of pulls, showing that the proposed algorithm is essentially optimal up to
logarithmic factors. Both upper and lower complexity bounds depend on a special
definition of the associated suboptimality gap, designed in particular for the
quantile bandit problem, as we show when the gap approaches zero, best-arm
identification is impossible. Second, motivated by applications where the
rewards are private, we provide a differentially private successive elimination
algorithm whose sample complexity is finite even for distributions with
infinite support-size, and we characterize its sample complexity. Our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of either the suboptimality gap or

                                        <span>Zero-shot object recognition or zero-shot learning aims to transfer the
object recognition ability among the semantically related categories, such as
fine-grained animal or bird species. However, the images of different
fine-grained objects tend to merely exhibit subtle differences in appearance,
which will severely deteriorate zero-shot object recognition. To reduce the
superfluous information in the fine-grained objects, in this paper, we propose
to learn the redundancy-free features for generalized zero-shot learning. We
achieve our motivation by projecting the original visual features into a new
(redundancy-free) feature space and then restricting the statistical dependence
between these two feature spaces. Furthermore, we require the projected
features to keep and even strengthen the category relationship in the
redundancy-free feature space. In this way, we can remove the redundant
information from the visual features without losing the discriminative
information. We extensively evaluate the performance on four benchmark
datasets. The results show that our redundancy-free feature based generalized
zero-shot learning (RFF-GZSL) approach can achieve competitive results compared
with the state-of-the-arts.</span>

                                        <span>Concept-based explanation approach is a popular model interpertability tool
because it expresses the reasons for a model&#x27;s predictions in terms of concepts
that are meaningful for the domain experts. In this work, we study the problem
of the concepts being correlated with confounding information in the features.
We propose a new causal prior graph for modeling the impacts of unobserved
variables and a method to remove the impact of confounding information and
noise using a two-stage regression technique borrowed from the instrumental
variable literature. We also model the completeness of the concepts set and
show that our debiasing method works when the concepts are not complete. Our
synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the success of our method in
removing biases and improving the ranking of the concepts in terms of their
contribution to the explanation of the predictions.</span>

classical regression methods first transform these data into vectors, therefore
ignoring the underlying structure of the data and increasing the dimensionality

research: &quot;upsampling&quot; coarse document labels to fine-grained labels or spans.
We pose the problem in a question answering format, with the answers providing
the fine-grained labels. We provide a benchmark dataset and baselines on a
socially impactful task: identifying the exact crowd size at protests and
demonstrations in the United States given only order-of-magnitude information
about protest attendance, a very small sample of fine-grained examples, and
English-language news text. We evaluate several baseline models, including
zero-shot results from rule-based and question-answering models, few-shot
models fine-tuned on a small set of documents, and weakly supervised models
using a larger set of coarsely-labeled documents. We find that our rule-based
model initially outperforms a zero-shot pre-trained transformer language model
but that further fine-tuning on a very small subset of 25 examples
substantially improves out-of-sample performance. We also demonstrate a method
for fine-tuning the transformer span on only the coarse labels that performs
similarly to our rule-based approach. This work will contribute to social

collective action.</span>

defining rules and heuristics, a tedious and time-consuming task for human
analysts. In order to improve automation and scalability, we propose an
alternative direction based on distributed representations of binary programs
with applicability to a number of downstream tasks. We introduce Bin2vec, a new
approach leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) along with computational
program graphs in order to learn a high dimensional representation of binary
executable programs. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using
our representations to solve two semantically different binary analysis tasks -
functional algorithm classification and vulnerability discovery. We compare the
proposed approach to our own strong baseline as well as published results and
demonstrate improvement over state-of-the-art methods for both tasks. We
evaluated Bin2vec on 49191 binaries for the functional algorithm classification
task, and on 30 different CWE-IDs including at least 100 CVE entries each for
the vulnerability discovery task. We set a new state-of-the-art result by
reducing the classification error by 40% compared to the source-code-based
inst2vec approach, while working on binary code. For almost every vulnerability
class in our dataset, our prediction accuracy is over 80% (and over 90% in
multiple classes).</span>

                                        <span>Partial differential equations are often used to model various physical
phenomena, such as heat diffusion, wave propagation, fluid dynamics,
elasticity, electrodynamics and image processing, and many analytic approaches
or traditional numerical methods have been developed and widely used for their
solutions. Inspired by rapidly growing impact of deep learning on scientific
and engineering research, in this paper we propose a novel neural network,
GF-Net, for learning the Green&#x27;s functions of linear reaction-diffusion
equations in an unsupervised fashion. The proposed method overcomes the
challenges for finding the Green&#x27;s functions of the equations on arbitrary
domains by utilizing physics-informed approach and the symmetry of the Green&#x27;s
function. As a consequence, it particularly leads to an efficient way for
solving the target equations under different boundary conditions and sources.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by experiments
in square, annular and L-shape domains.</span>

                                        <span>Resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, have become
ubiquitous in recent years. This has led to the generation of large quantities
of data in real-time, which is an appealing target for AI systems. However,
deploying machine learning models on such end-devices is nearly impossible. A
typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such
as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to
increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this
issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge
of the network, i.e close to the IoT devices where the data is generated.
Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates
the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data
sources. This survey describes major research efforts where machine learning
systems have been deployed at the edge of computer networks, focusing on the
operational aspects including compression techniques, tools, frameworks, and
hardware used in successful applications of intelligent edge systems.</span>

gradient-based learning algorithms are driven by feedback queried at points
with almost no performance guarantees on their own. Here we explore a modified
&quot;anytime online-to-batch&quot; mechanism which for smooth objectives admits
high-probability error bounds while requiring only lower-order moment bounds on
the stochastic gradients. Using this conversion, we can derive a wide variety
of &quot;anytime robust&quot; procedures, for which the task of performance analysis can
be effectively reduced to regret control, meaning that existing regret bounds
(for the bounded gradient case) can be robustified and leveraged in a
straightforward manner. As a direct takeaway, we obtain an easily implemented
stochastic gradient-based algorithm for which all queried points formally enjoy
sub-Gaussian error bounds, and in practice show noteworthy gains on real-world
data applications.</span>

source code model. Corder is designed to alleviate the need of labeled data for
code retrieval and code summarization tasks. The pre-trained model of Corder
can be used in two ways: (1) it can produce vector representation of code which
can be applied to code retrieval tasks that do not have labeled data; (2) it
can be used in a fine-tuning process for tasks that might still require label
data such as code summarization. The key innovation is that we train the source
code model by asking it to recognize similar and dissimilar code snippets
through a contrastive learning objective. To do so, we use a set of
semantic-preserving transformation operators to generate code snippets that are
syntactically diverse but semantically equivalent. Through extensive
experiments, we have shown that the code models pretrained by Corder
substantially outperform the other baselines for code-to-code retrieval,

underlying stock for reinforcement learning option price. We use accessible
features of the equities pricing data to construct a non-deterministic Markov
decision process for modeling stock price behavior driven by principal
investor&#x27;s decision making. However, low signal-to-noise ratio and instability
that appear immanent in equity markets pose challenges to determine the state
transition (price change) after executing an action (principal investor&#x27;s
decision) as well as decide an action based on current state (spot price). In
order to conquer these challenges, we resort to a Bayesian deep neural network
for computing the predictive distribution of the state transition led by an
action. Additionally, instead of exploring a state-action relationship to
formulate a policy, we seek for an episode based visible-hidden state-action
relationship to probabilistically imitate principal investor&#x27;s successive
decision making. Our algorithm then maps imitative principal investor&#x27;s
decisions to simulated stock price paths by a Bayesian deep neural network.
Eventually the optimal option price is reinforcement learned through maximizing
the cumulative risk-adjusted return of a dynamically hedged portfolio over
simulated price paths of the underlying.</span>

                                        <span>Human keypoint detection from a single image is very challenging due to
occlusion, blur, illumination and scale variance. In this paper, we address
this problem from three aspects by devising an efficient network structure,
proposing three effective training strategies, and exploiting four useful
postprocessing techniques. First, we find that context information plays an
important role in reasoning human body configuration and invisible keypoints.
Inspired by this, we propose a cascaded context mixer (CCM), which efficiently
integrates spatial and channel context information and progressively refines
them. Then, to maximize CCM&#x27;s representation capability, we develop a
hard-negative person detection mining strategy and a joint-training strategy by
exploiting abundant unlabeled data. It enables CCM to learn discriminative
features from massive diverse poses. Third, we present several sub-pixel
refinement techniques for postprocessing keypoint predictions to improve
detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO keypoint detection
benchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over
representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our single model achieves
comparable performance with the winner of the 2018 COCO Keypoint Detection
Challenge. The final ensemble model sets a new SOTA on this benchmark.</span>

information on a function ($f$) to assist in numerical approximations. Here it
is shown how, using only basic physics and a numerical approximation, such
information can be accurately obtained at a cost of ${\cal O}(N)$ complexity,
where $N$ is the dimensionality of the parameter space of $f$. In this paper,
an algorithm ({\em VA-Flow}) is developed to exploit this second order
information, and pseudocode is presented. It is applied to two classes of
problems, that of inverse kinematics (IK) and gradient descent (GD). In the IK
application, the algorithm is fast and robust, and is shown to lead to smooth
behavior even near singularities. For GD the algorithm also works very well,
provided the cost function is locally well-described by a polynomial.</span>

                                        <span>Through the lens of information-theoretic reductions, we examine a reductions
approach to fair optimization and learning where a black-box optimizer is used
to learn a fair model for classification or regression. Quantifying the
complexity, both statistically and computationally, of making such models
satisfy the rigorous definition of differential privacy is our end goal. We
resolve a few open questions and show applicability to fair machine learning,
hypothesis testing, and to optimizing non-standard measures of classification
loss. Furthermore, our sample complexity bounds are tight amongst all
strategies that jointly minimize a composition of functions.

The reductions approach to fair optimization can be abstracted as the
constrained group-objective optimization problem where we aim to optimize an
objective that is a function of losses of individual groups, subject to some
constraints. We give the first polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem
with $(\epsilon, 0)$ or $(\epsilon, \delta)$ differential privacy guarantees
when defined on a convex decision set (for example, the $\ell_P$ unit ball)
with convex constraints and losses. Accompanying information-theoretic lower
bounds for the problem are presented. In addition, compared to a previous
method for ensuring differential privacy subject to a relaxed form of the
equalized odds fairness constraint, the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially
private algorithm we present provides asymptotically better sample complexity
guarantees, resulting in an exponential improvement in certain parameter
regimes. We introduce a class of bounded divergence linear optimizers, which
could be of independent interest, and specialize to pure and approximate
differential privacy.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a meta-learning framework for few-shots One-Class
Classification (OCC) at test-time, a setting where labeled examples are only
available for the positive class, and no supervision is given for the negative
example. We consider that we have a set of &#x60;one-class classification&#x27;
objective-tasks with only a small set of positive examples available for each
task, and a set of training tasks with full supervision (i.e. highly imbalanced
classification). We propose an approach using order-equivariant networks to
learn a &#x27;meta&#x27; binary-classifier. The model will take as input an example to
classify from a given task, as well as the corresponding supervised set of
positive examples for this OCC task. Thus, the output of the model will be
&#x27;conditioned&#x27; on the available positive example of a given task, allowing to
predict on new tasks and new examples without labeled negative examples. In
this paper, we are motivated by an astronomy application. Our goal is to
identify if stars belong to a specific stellar group (the &#x27;one-class&#x27; for a
given task), called \textit{stellar streams}, where each stellar stream is a
different OCC-task. We show that our method transfers well on unseen (test)
synthetic streams, and outperforms the baselines even though it is not
retrained and accesses a much smaller part of the data per task to predict
(only positive supervision). We see however that it doesn&#x27;t transfer as well on
the real stream GD-1. This could come from intrinsic differences from the
synthetic and real stream, highlighting the need for consistency in the
&#x27;nature&#x27; of the task for this method. However, light fine-tuning improve
performances and outperform our baselines. Our experiments show encouraging
results to further explore meta-learning methods for OCC tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness
properties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most
inputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in
security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local
robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the
time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce
global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly
stronger than local robustness.

In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that
satisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global
robustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel
booster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We
structure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new
verifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster
increases the classifier&#x27;s capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global
robustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.

To the best of our knowledge, the only global robustness property that has
been previously achieved is monotonicity. Several previous works have defined
global robustness properties, but their training techniques failed to achieve
verified global robustness. In comparison, we show that we can train
classifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three
security datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest
impact on the classifier&#x27;s performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam
account classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4%
decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate,
compared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn&#x27;t satisfy any property.</span>

state-of-the-art Transformer models. But is it really required? This paper
investigates the true importance and contribution of the dot product-based
self-attention mechanism on the performance of Transformer models. Via
extensive experiments, we find that (1) random alignment matrices surprisingly
perform quite competitively and (2) learning attention weights from token-token
(query-key) interactions is useful but not that important after all. To this
end, we propose \textsc{Synthesizer}, a model that learns synthetic attention
weights without token-token interactions. In our experiments, we first show
that simple Synthesizers achieve highly competitive performance when compared
against vanilla Transformer models across a range of tasks, including machine
translation, language modeling, text generation and GLUE/SuperGLUE benchmarks.
When composed with dot product attention, we find that Synthesizers
consistently outperform Transformers. Moreover, we conduct additional
comparisons of Synthesizers against Dynamic Convolutions, showing that simple
Random Synthesizer is not only $60\%$ faster but also improves perplexity by a
relative $3.5\%$. Finally, we show that simple factorized Synthesizers can
outperform Linformers on encoding only tasks.</span>

techniques, such as Kernel Ridge Regression, inapplicable, posing a serious
computational challenge. Divide-and-conquer is a common remedy, suggesting to
split the dataset into disjoint partitions, obtain the local estimates and
average them, it allows to scale-up an otherwise ineffective base approach. In
the current study we suggest a fully data-driven approach to quantify
uncertainty of the averaged estimator. Namely, we construct simultaneous
element-wise confidence bands for the predictions yielded by the averaged
estimator on a given deterministic prediction set. The novel approach features
rigorous theoretical guaranties for a wide class of base learners with Kernel
Ridge regression being a special case. As a by-product of our analysis we also
obtain a sup-norm consistency result for the divide-and-conquer Kernel Ridge
Regression. The simulation study supports the theoretical findings.</span>

                                        <span>Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is one of the most critical tasks for
digital display advertising. Commercial systems often require to update models
in an online learning manner to catch up with the evolving data distribution.
However, conversions usually do not happen immediately after a user click. This
may result in inaccurate labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. In
previous studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting
positive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample
on its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when a conversion happens
later. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels
and utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike
a balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback
Model (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion
distribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the
expectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the
elapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight
for each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in CVR
prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ES-DFM, we conduct extensive
experiments on a public data and a private industrial dataset. Experimental
results confirm that our method consistently outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art results.</span>

deep-learning-based automatic sleep scoring from being used in clinical
environments. Towards interpretability, this work proposes a
sequence-to-sequence sleep-staging model, namely SleepTransformer. It is based
on the transformer backbone whose self-attention scores offer interpretability
of the model&#x27;s decisions at both the epoch and sequence level. At the epoch
level, the attention scores can be encoded as a heat map to highlight
sleep-relevant features captured from the input EEG signal. At the sequence
level, the attention scores are visualized as the influence of different
neighboring epochs in an input sequence (i.e. the context) to recognition of a
target epoch, mimicking the way manual scoring is done by human experts. We
further propose a simple yet efficient method to quantify uncertainty in the
model&#x27;s decisions. The method, which is based on entropy, can serve as a metric
for deferring low-confidence epochs to a human expert for further inspection.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed SleepTransformer outperforms
existing methods at a lower computational cost and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two experimental databases of different sizes.</span>

                                        <span>Measuring the generalization capacity of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) is
difficult because of the curse of dimensionality. Evaluation metrics for DGMs
such as Inception Score, Fr\&#x27;echet Inception Distance, Precision-Recall, and
Neural Net Divergence try to estimate the distance between the generated
distribution and the target distribution using a polynomial number of samples.
These metrics are the target of researchers when designing new models. Despite
the claims, it is still unclear how well can they measure the generalization
capacity of a generative model. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of
these metrics in measuring the generalization capacity. We introduce a
framework for comparing the robustness of evaluation metrics. We show that
better scores in these metrics do not imply better generalization. They can be
fooled easily by a generator that memorizes a small subset of the training set.
We propose a fix to the NND metric to make it more robust to noise in the
generated data. Toward building a robust metric for generalization, we propose
to apply the Minimum Description Length principle to the problem of evaluating
DGMs. We develop an efficient method for estimating the complexity of
Generative Latent Variable Models (GLVMs). Experimental results show that our
metric can effectively detect training set memorization and distinguish GLVMs
of different generalization capacities. Source code is available at

a system by simulating attacks against it. So far, penetration testing has been
carried out mainly by trained human attackers and its success critically
depended on the available expertise. Automating this practice constitutes a
non-trivial problem, as the range of actions that a human expert may attempts
against a system and the range of knowledge she relies on to take her decisions
are hard to capture. In this paper, we focus our attention on simplified
penetration testing problems expressed in the form of capture the flag hacking
challenges, and we analyze how model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may
help to solve them. In modeling these capture the flag competitions as
reinforcement learning problems we highlight that a specific challenge that
characterize penetration testing is the problem of discovering the structure of
the problem at hand. We then show how this challenge may be eased by relying on
different forms of prior knowledge that may be provided to the agent. In this
way we demonstrate how the feasibility of tackling penetration testing using
reinforcement learning may rest on a careful trade-off between model-free and
model-based algorithms. By using techniques to inject a priori knowledge, we
show it is possible to better direct the agent and restrict the space of its
exploration problem, thus achieving solutions more efficiently.</span>

applications, there are relatively few works on hypergraph representation
learning, most of which primarily focus on hyperlink prediction, often
restricted to the transductive learning setting. Among others, a major hurdle
for effective hypergraph representation learning lies in the label scarcity of
nodes and/or hyperedges. To address this issue, this paper presents an
end-to-end, bi-level pre-training strategy with Graph Neural Networks for
hypergraphs. The proposed framework named HyperGene bears three distinctive
advantages. First, it is capable of ingesting the labeling information when
available, but more importantly, it is mainly designed in the self-supervised
fashion which significantly broadens its applicability. Second, at the heart of
the proposed HyperGene are two carefully designed pretexts, one on the node
level and the other on the hyperedge level, which enable us to encode both the
local and the global context in a mutually complementary way. Third, the
proposed framework can work in both transductive and inductive settings. When
applying the two proposed pretexts in tandem, it can accelerate the adaptation
of the knowledge from the pre-trained model to downstream applications in the
transductive setting, thanks to the bi-level nature of the proposed method. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) HyperGene achieves up to
5.69% improvements in hyperedge classification, and (2) improves pre-training
efficiency by up to 42.80% on average.</span>

                                        <span>Conformal predictors are an important class of algorithms that allow
predictions to be made with a user-defined confidence level. They are able to
do this by outputting prediction sets, rather than simple point predictions.
The conformal predictor is valid in the sense that the accuracy of its
predictions is guaranteed to meet the confidence level, only assuming
exchangeability in the data. Since accuracy is guaranteed, the performance of a
conformal predictor is measured through the efficiency of the prediction sets.
Typically, a conformal predictor is built on an underlying machine learning
algorithm and hence its predictive power is inherited from this algorithm.
However, since the underlying machine learning algorithm is not trained with
the objective of minimizing predictive efficiency it means that the resulting
conformal predictor may be sub-optimal and not aligned sufficiently to this
objective. Hence, in this study we consider an approach to train the conformal
predictor directly with maximum predictive efficiency as the optimization
objective, and we focus specifically on the inductive conformal predictor for
classification. To do this, the conformal predictor is approximated by a
differentiable objective function and gradient descent used to optimize it. The
resulting parameter estimates are then passed to a proper inductive conformal
predictor to give valid prediction sets. We test the method on several real
world data sets and find that the method is promising and in most cases gives
improved predictive efficiency against a baseline conformal predictor.</span>

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general framework that allows systems to
learn autonomously through trial-and-error interaction with their environment.
In recent years combining RL with expressive, high-capacity neural network
models has led to impressive performance in a diverse range of domains.
However, dealing with the large state and action spaces often required for
problems in the real world still remains a significant challenge. In this paper
we introduce a new simulation environment, &quot;Gambit&quot;, designed as a tool to
build scenarios that can drive RL research in a direction useful for military
analysis. Using this environment we focus on an abstracted and simplified room
clearance scenario, where a team of blue agents have to make their way through
a building and ensure that all rooms are cleared of (and remain clear) of enemy
red agents. We implement a multi-agent version of feudal hierarchical RL that
introduces a command hierarchy where a commander at the higher level sends
orders to multiple agents at the lower level who simply have to learn to follow
these orders. We find that breaking the task down in this way allows us to
solve a number of non-trivial floorplans that require the coordination of
multiple agents much more efficiently than the standard baseline RL algorithms
we compare with. We then go on to explore how qualitatively different behaviour
can emerge depending on what we prioritise in the agent&#x27;s reward function (e.g.
clearing the building quickly vs. prioritising rescuing civilians).</span>

                                        <span>Training convolutional neural networks with a Lipschitz constraint under the
$l_{2}$ norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness, interpretable
gradients, stable training, etc. While 1-Lipschitz networks can be designed by
imposing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such networks
requires each layer to be gradient norm preserving (GNP) to prevent gradients
from vanishing. However, existing GNP convolutions suffer from slow training,
lead to significant reduction in accuracy and provide no guarantees on their
approximations. In this work, we propose a GNP convolution layer called
\methodnamebold\ (\methodabv) that uses the following mathematical property:
when a matrix is {\it Skew-Symmetric}, its exponential function is an {\it
orthogonal} matrix. To use this property, we first construct a convolution
filter whose Jacobian is Skew-Symmetric. Then, we use the Taylor series
expansion of the Jacobian exponential to construct the \methodabv\ layer that
is orthogonal. To efficiently implement \methodabv, we keep a finite number of
terms from the Taylor series and provide a provable guarantee on the
approximation error. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that
\methodabv\ allows us to train provably Lipschitz, large convolutional neural
networks significantly faster than prior works while achieving significant
improvements for both standard and certified robust accuracies.</span>

While deep learning has achieved remarkable success on image-based tasks, there
are many unique challenges faced by deep neural networks in processing massive,

learning for 3D point cloud understanding, this paper summarizes recent

                                        <span>In anomaly detection (AD), one seeks to identify whether a test sample is
abnormal, given a data set of normal samples. A recent and promising approach
to AD relies on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders
(VAEs), for unsupervised learning of the normal data distribution. In
semi-supervised AD (SSAD), the data also includes a small sample of labeled
anomalies. In this work, we propose two variational methods for training VAEs
for SSAD. The intuitive idea in both methods is to train the encoder to
&#x60;separate&#x27; between latent vectors for normal and outlier data. We show that
this idea can be derived from principled probabilistic formulations of the
problem, and propose simple and effective algorithms. Our methods can be
applied to various data types, as we demonstrate on SSAD datasets ranging from
natural images to astronomy and medicine, can be combined with any VAE model
architecture, and are naturally compatible with ensembling. When comparing to
state-of-the-art SSAD methods that are not specific to particular data types,
we obtain marked improvement in outlier detection.</span>

unadjusted Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm when the potential $f$
satisfies a strong dissipativity condition and it is first-order smooth with
Lipschitz gradient. We prove that, initialized with a Gaussian that has
sufficiently small variance, $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\lambda d\epsilon^{-1})$
steps of the LMC algorithm are sufficient to reach $\epsilon$-neighborhood of
the target in Chi-square divergence, where $\lambda$ is the log-Sobolev
constant of $\nu_*$. Our results do not require warm-start to deal with
exponential dimension dependency in Chi-square divergence at initialization. In
particular, for strongly convex and first-order smooth potentials, we show that
the LMC algorithm achieves the rate estimate
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-1})$ which improves the previously known
rates in this metric, under the same assumptions. Translating to other metrics,
our result also recovers the best-known rate estimates in KL divergence, total
variation and $2$-Wasserstein distance in the same setup. Finally, as we rely
on the log-Sobolev inequality, our framework covers a wide range of non-convex
potentials that are first-order smooth and that exhibit strong convexity

research has focused on reinforcement learning with deep neural networks as
function approximators. New methods are typically evaluated on a set of
environments that have now become standard, such as Atari 2600 games. While
these benchmarks help standardize evaluation, their computational cost has the
unfortunate side effect of widening the gap between those with ample access to
computational resources, and those without. In this work we argue that, despite
the community&#x27;s emphasis on large-scale environments, the traditional
small-scale environments can still yield valuable scientific insights and can
help reduce the barriers to entry for underprivileged communities. To
substantiate our claims, we empirically revisit the paper which introduced the

setting for anomaly detection where a small additional set of labeled samples
are provided. Based on the analysis of Deep SAD, the state-of-the-art for
semi-supervised anomaly detection, we propose a new KL-divergence based
objective function and show that two factors: the mutual information between
the data and latent representations, and the entropy of latent representations,
constitute an integral objective function for anomaly detection. To resolve the
contradiction in simultaneously optimizing the two factors, we propose a novel
encoder-decoder-encoder structure, with the first encoder focusing on
optimizing the mutual information and the second encoder focusing on optimizing
the entropy. The two encoders are enforced to share similar encoding with a
consistent constraint on their latent representations. Extensive experiments
have revealed that the proposed method significantly outperforms several
state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmark datasets, including medical diagnosis

determined by the optic cup to disc diameter ratio (CDR), which requires the
segmentation of the cup and disc regions. In this paper, we propose two novel
approaches, namely Parameter-Shared Branched Network (PSBN) andWeak Region of
Interest Model-based segmentation (WRoIM) to identify disc and cup boundaries.
Unlike the previous approaches, the proposed methods are trained end-to-end
through a single neural network architecture and use dynamic cropping instead
of manual or traditional computer vision-based cropping. We are able to achieve
similar performance as that of state-of-the-art approaches with less number of

$7.8 \times 10^6$ parameters our approach achieves a Dice score of 0.96/0.89

the corresponding target vector or source vector cannot be effectively learned.
In this paper, we propose a novel Directed Graph embedding framework based on
Generative Adversarial Network, called DGGAN. The main idea is to use
adversarial mechanisms to deploy a discriminator and two generators that
jointly learn each node&#x27;s source and target vectors. For a given node, the two
generators are trained to generate its fake target and source neighbor nodes
from the same underlying distribution, and the discriminator aims to
distinguish whether a neighbor node is real or fake. The two generators are
formulated into a unified framework and could mutually reinforce each other to
learn more robust source and target vectors. Extensive experiments show that
DGGAN consistently and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods across multiple graph mining tasks on directed graphs.</span>

of any kind with gradient descent in parameter space is strongly related to
kernel gradient descent in function space with respect to the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK). Lee et al. (2019) built on this result by establishing that the
output of a neural network trained using gradient descent can be approximated
by a linear model for wide networks. In parallel, a recent line of studies
(Schoenholz et al. 2017; Hayou et al. 2019) has suggested that a special
initialization, known as the Edge of Chaos, improves training. In this paper,
we bridge the gap between these two concepts by quantifying the impact of the
initialization and the activation function on the NTK when the network depth
becomes large. In particular, we show that the performance of wide deep neural
networks cannot be explained by the NTK regime and we provide experiments
illustrating our theoretical results.</span>

consequences, or properties in a legal document, or changing some key
information of an event in a news text. This is very challenging, as it is hard
to obtain a parallel corpus for training, and we need to first find all text
positions that should be changed and then decide how to change them. We
constructed the new dataset WikiBioCTE for this task based on the existing
dataset WikiBio (originally created for table-to-text generation). We use
WikiBioCTE for training, and manually labeled a test set for testing. We also
propose novel evaluation metrics and a novel method for solving the new task.

To improve the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods
for robot manipulator trajectory planning in random working environments, we
present three dense reward functions. These rewards differ from the traditional
sparse reward. First, a posture reward function is proposed to speed up the
learning process with a more reasonable trajectory by modeling the distance and
direction constraints, which can reduce the blindness of exploration. Second, a
stride reward function is proposed to improve the stability of the learning
process by modeling the distance and movement distance of joint constraints.
Finally, in order to further improve learning efficiency, we are inspired by
the cognitive process of human behavior and propose a stage incentive
mechanism, including a hard stage incentive reward function and a soft stage
incentive reward function. Extensive experiments show that the soft stage
incentive reward function is able to improve the convergence rate by up to
46.9% with the state-of-the-art DRL methods. The percentage increase in the
convergence mean reward was 4.4-15.5% and the percentage decreases with respect
to standard deviation were 21.9-63.2%. In the evaluation experiments, the
success rate of trajectory planning for a robot manipulator reached 99.6%.</span>

                                        <span>Disentanglement is a highly desirable property of representation owing to its
similarity to human understanding and reasoning. Many works achieve
disentanglement upon information bottlenecks (IB). Despite their elegant
mathematical foundations, the IB branch usually exhibits lower performance. In
order to provide an insight into the problem, we develop an annealing test to
calculate the information freezing point (IFP), which is a transition state to
freeze information into the latent variables. We also explore these clues or
inductive biases for separating the entangled factors according to the
differences in the IFP distributions. We found the existing approaches suffer
from the information diffusion problem, according to which the increased
information diffuses in all latent variables.

Based on this insight, we propose a novel disentanglement framework, termed
the distilling entangled factor (DEFT), to address the information diffusion
problem by scaling backward information. DEFT applies a multistage training
strategy, including multigroup encoders with different learning rates and
piecewise disentanglement pressure, to disentangle the factors stage by stage.
We evaluate DEFT on three variants of dSprite and SmallNORB, which show
low-variance and high-level disentanglement scores. Furthermore, the experiment
under the correlative factors shows incapable of TC-based approaches. DEFT also
exhibits a competitive performance in the unsupervised setting.</span>

                                        <span>Inspired by the success of classical neural networks, there has been
tremendous effort to develop classical effective neural networks into quantum
concept. In this paper, a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network with
deep residual learning (Res-HQCNN) is proposed. We firstly analysis how to
connect residual block structure with a quantum neural network, and give the
corresponding training algorithm. At the same time, the advantages and
disadvantages of transforming deep residual learning into quantum concept are
provided. As a result, the model can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
analogue to the backpropagation in classical neural networks.

To explore the effectiveness of Res-HQCNN , we perform extensive experiments
for quantum data with or without noisy on classical computer. The experimental
results show the Res-HQCNN performs better to learn an unknown unitary
transformation and has stronger robustness for noisy data, when compared to
state of the arts. Moreover, the possible methods of combining residual
learning with quantum neural networks are also discussed.</span>

people and caused approximately 3.17 million deaths around the world up to the
present. The rapid spread of COVID-19 is continuing to threaten human&#x27;s life
and health. Therefore, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD)
systems based on machine and deep learning methods which are able to accurately
differentiate COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT)
and X-Ray datasets is essential and of immediate priority. Different from most
of the previous studies which used either one of CT or X-ray images, we
employed both data types with sufficient samples in implementation. On the
other hand, due to the extreme sensitivity of this pervasive virus, model
uncertainty should be considered, while most previous studies have overlooked
it. Therefore, we propose a novel powerful fusion model named
$UncertaintyFuseNet$ that consists of an uncertainty module: Ensemble Monte
Carlo (EMC) dropout. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of our
proposed fusion for COVID-19 detection using CT scan and X-Ray datasets. Also,
our proposed $UncertaintyFuseNet$ model is significantly robust to noise and
performs well with the previously unseen data. The source codes and models of
this study are available at:

                                        <span>Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are a prominent class of
adversarial examples that exploit the systemic vulnerabilities and enable
physically realizable and robust attacks against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
UAPs generalize across many different inputs; this leads to realistic and
effective attacks that can be applied at scale. In this paper we propose
HyperNeuron, an efficient and scalable algorithm that allows for the real-time
detection of UAPs by identifying suspicious neuron hyper-activations. Our
results show the effectiveness of HyperNeuron on multiple tasks (image
classification, object detection), against a wide variety of universal attacks,
and in realistic scenarios, like perceptual ad-blocking and adversarial
patches. HyperNeuron is able to simultaneously detect both adversarial mask and
patch UAPs with comparable or better performance than existing UAP defenses
whilst introducing a significantly reduced latency of only 0.86 milliseconds
per image. This suggests that many realistic and practical universal attacks
can be reliably mitigated in real-time, which shows promise for the robust
deployment of machine learning systems.</span>

                                        <span>Widespread adoption of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
cells (HT-PEMFCs) and HT-PEM electrochemical hydrogen pumps (HT-PEM ECHPs)
requires models and computational tools that provide accurate scale-up and
optimization. Knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time consuming
and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g.,
material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials).
Data-driven modeling on the other hand, is easier to implement, but often
necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this
contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are uniquely
combined by implementing a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based
model originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data
(887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model.
Furthermore, the source model developed for HT-PEMFCs was successfully applied
to HT-PEM ECHPs - a different electrochemical system that utilizes similar
materials to the fuel cell. Experimental datasets from both HT-PEMFCs and
HT-PEM ECHPs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points
each) were used to train 8 target models via FSL. Models for the unseen data
reached high accuracies in all cases (rRMSE between 1.04 and 3.73% for HT-PEMCs
and between 6.38 and 8.46% for HT-PEM ECHPs).</span>

(KG) entities. Current methods have explored and utilized the graph structure,
the entity names and attributes, but ignore the ontology (or ontological
schema) which contains critical meta information such as classes and their
membership relationships with entities. In this paper, we propose an
ontology-guided entity alignment method named OntoEA, where both KGs and their
ontologies are jointly embedded, and the class hierarchy and the class
disjointness are utilized to avoid false mappings. Extensive experiments on
seven public and industrial benchmarks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art

                                        <span>Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or
offices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object,
we jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in;
the same type of container will have a different probability of having the
target depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic
information to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects
are best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a
3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and
geometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search
process, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that
guides an agent&#x27;s actions towards finding a target object specified with a
natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network
architecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual,
geometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of
the graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a
novel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically
related objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better
than several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in
terms of the median number of actions required. Additional qualitative results
can be found at https://ai.stanford.edu/mech-search/hms.</span>

contributing 35% of our global agriculture yield. In spite of their importance,
beekeeping is exclusively dependent on human labor and experience-derived
heuristics, while requiring frequent human checkups to ensure the colony is
healthy, which can disrupt the colony. Increasingly, pollinator populations are
declining due to threats from climate change, pests, environmental toxicity,
making their management even more critical than ever before in order to ensure
sustained global food security. To start addressing this pressing challenge, we
developed an integrated hardware sensing system for beehive monitoring through
audio and environment measurements, and a hierarchical semi-supervised deep
learning model, composed of an audio modeling module and a predictor, to model
the strength of beehives. The model is trained jointly on audio reconstruction
and prediction losses based on human inspections, in order to model both
low-level audio features and circadian temporal dynamics. We show that this
model performs well despite limited labels, and can learn an audio embedding
that is useful for characterizing different sound profiles of beehives. This is
the first instance to our knowledge of applying audio-based deep learning to
model beehives and population size in an observational setting across a large

                                        <span>Modeling the burning processes of biomass such as wood, grass, and crops is
crucial for the modeling and prediction of wildland and urban fire behavior.
Despite its importance, the burning of solid fuels remains poorly understood,
which can be partly attributed to the unknown chemical kinetics of most solid
fuels. Most available kinetic models were built upon expert knowledge, which
requires chemical insights and years of experience. This work presents a
framework for autonomously discovering biomass pyrolysis kinetic models from
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experimental data using the recently developed
chemical reaction neural networks (CRNN). The approach incorporated the CRNN
model into the framework of neural ordinary differential equations to predict
the residual mass in TGA data. In addition to the flexibility of
neural-network-based models, the learned CRNN model is fully interpretable, by
incorporating the fundamental physics laws, such as the law of mass action and
Arrhenius law, into the neural network structure. The learned CRNN model can
then be translated into the classical forms of biomass chemical kinetic models,
which facilitates the extraction of chemical insights and the integration of
the kinetic model into large-scale fire simulations. We demonstrated the
effectiveness of the framework in predicting the pyrolysis and oxidation of
cellulose. This successful demonstration opens the possibility of rapid and
autonomous chemical kinetic modeling of solid fuels, such as wildfire fuels and
industrial polymers.</span>

                                        <span>Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain meaningful
node representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node
classification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning
methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node
representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for
improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is
important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations
and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To
this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph
Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous
graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics.
Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to
learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately.
Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the
interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the
relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation
semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process.
Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware
node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation
representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of
graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic segmentation methods are an important advancement in medical image
analysis. Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular,
are the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with
class imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions
often occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss
functions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their
robustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence.
The most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the
cross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose a Unified
Focal loss, a new framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based
losses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on
three highly class imbalanced, publicly available medical imaging datasets:
Breast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and
Kidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function
performance against six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, and
demonstrate that our proposed loss function is robust to class imbalance,
outperforming the other loss functions across datasets. Finally, we use the
Unified Focal loss together with deep supervision to achieve state-of-the-art
results without modification of the original U-Net architecture, with a mean
Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)&#x3D;0.948 on BUS2017, enhancing tumour region
DSC&#x3D;0.800 on BraTS20 and kidney tumour DSC&#x3D;0.758 on KiTS19. This highlights the
importance of carefully selecting a suitable loss function prior to the use of
more complex architectures.</span>

induce coordination among the algorithmically-guided vehicles. We benchmark our
algorithm with baselines in a ride-hailing simulation environment to
demonstrate its superiority in improving income efficiency meausred by
income-per-hour. We have also designed and run a real-world experiment program
with regular drivers on a major ride-hailing platform. We have observed

                                        <span>Successful teaching requires an assumption of how the learner learns - how
the learner uses experiences from the world to update their internal states. We
investigate what expectations people have about a learner when they teach them
in an online manner using rewards and punishment. We focus on a common
reinforcement learning method, Q-learning, and examine what assumptions people
have using a behavioral experiment. To do so, we first establish a normative
standard, by formulating the problem as a machine teaching optimization
problem. To solve the machine teaching optimization problem, we use a deep
learning approximation method which simulates learners in the environment and
learns to predict how feedback affects the learner&#x27;s internal states. What do
people assume about a learner&#x27;s learning and discount rates when they teach
them an idealized exploration-exploitation task? In a behavioral experiment, we
find that people can teach the task to Q-learners in a relatively efficient and
effective manner when the learner uses a small value for its discounting rate
and a large value for its learning rate. However, they still are suboptimal. We
also find that providing people with real-time updates of how possible feedback
would affect the Q-learner&#x27;s internal states weakly helps them teach. Our
results reveal how people teach using evaluative feedback and provide guidance
for how engineers should design machine agents in a manner that is intuitive
for people.</span>

                                        <span>The Information bottleneck (IB) method enables optimizing over the trade-off
between compression of data and prediction accuracy of learned representations,
and has successfully and robustly been applied to both supervised and
unsupervised representation learning problems. However, IB has several
limitations. First, the IB problem is hard to optimize. The IB Lagrangian
$\mathcal{L}_{IB}:&#x3D;I(X;Z)-\beta I(Y;Z)$ is non-convex and existing solutions
guarantee only local convergence. As a result, the obtained solutions depend on
initialization. Second, the evaluation of a solution is also a challenging
task. Conventionally, it resorts to characterizing the information plane, that
is, plotting $I(Y;Z)$ versus $I(X;Z)$ for all solutions obtained from different
initial points. Furthermore, the IB Lagrangian has phase transitions while
varying the multiplier $\beta$. At phase transitions, both $I(X;Z)$ and
$I(Y;Z)$ increase abruptly and the rate of convergence becomes significantly
slow for existing solutions. Recent works with IB adopt variational surrogate
bounds to the IB Lagrangian. Although allowing efficient optimization, how
close are these surrogates to the IB Lagrangian is not clear. In this work, we
solve the IB Lagrangian using augmented Lagrangian methods. With augmented
variables, we show that the IB objective can be solved with the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Different from prior works, we prove
that the proposed algorithm is consistently convergent, regardless of the value
of $\beta$. Empirically, our gradient-descent-based method results in
information plane points that are comparable to those obtained through the
conventional Blahut-Arimoto-based solvers and is convergent for a wider range
of the penalty coefficient than previous ADMM solvers.</span>

operations of today&#x27;s interconnected power grids. This paper is a confluence of
quantum computing, data science and machine learning to potentially address the
power system TSA challenge. We devise a quantum TSA (qTSA) method to enable
scalable and efficient data-driven transient stability prediction for bulk
power systems, which is the first attempt to tackle the TSA issue with quantum
computing. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) A low-depth, high
expressibility quantum neural network for accurate and noise-resilient TSA; 2)
A quantum natural gradient descent algorithm for efficient qTSA training; 3) A
systematical analysis on qTSA&#x27;s performance under various quantum factors. qTSA
underpins a foundation of quantum-enabled and data-driven power grid stability
analytics. It renders the intractable TSA straightforward and effortless in the
Hilbert space, and therefore provides stability information for power system
operations. Extensive experiments on quantum simulators and real quantum
computers verify the accuracy, noise-resilience, scalability and universality
of qTSA.</span>

                                        <span>Weakly-supervised anomaly detection aims at learning an anomaly detector from
a limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Recent works
build deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping
the normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature
space or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of
annotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative
loss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel
strategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that
could be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder
to encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,
reconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new
representation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test
sample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its
projection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we
also propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three
factors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy
are clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive
methods.</span>

expanded from professional, editor-lead journalism all the way to citizen
journalism. Nowadays, politicians and other key players enjoy direct access to
their audiences through social media, bypassing the filters of official cables
or traditional media. However, the multiple advantages of free speech and
direct communication are dimmed by the misuse of media to spread inaccurate or
misleading claims. These phenomena have led to the modern incarnation of the
fact-checker -- a professional whose main aim is to examine claims using
available evidence and to assess their veracity. As in other text forensics
tasks, the amount of information available makes the work of the fact-checker
more difficult. With this in mind, starting from the perspective of the
professional fact-checker, we survey the available intelligent technologies
that can support the human expert in the different steps of her fact-checking
endeavor. These include identifying claims worth fact-checking, detecting
relevant previously fact-checked claims, retrieving relevant evidence to
fact-check a claim, and actually verifying a claim. In each case, we pay
attention to the challenges in future work and the potential impact on
real-world fact-checking.</span>

generalization properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in non-convex
deep learning problems is still an important challenge. While modeling the
trajectories of SGD via stochastic differential equations (SDE) under
heavy-tailed gradient noise has recently shed light over several peculiar
characteristics of SGD, a rigorous treatment of the generalization properties
of such SDEs in a learning theoretical framework is still missing. Aiming to
bridge this gap, in this paper, we prove generalization bounds for SGD under
the assumption that its trajectories can be well-approximated by a \emph{Feller
process}, which defines a rich class of Markov processes that include several
recent SDE representations (both Brownian or heavy-tailed) as its special case.
We show that the generalization error can be controlled by the \emph{Hausdorff
dimension} of the trajectories, which is intimately linked to the tail behavior
of the driving process. Our results imply that heavier-tailed processes should
achieve better generalization; hence, the tail-index of the process can be used
as a notion of &quot;capacity metric&quot;. We support our theory with experiments on
deep neural networks illustrating that the proposed capacity metric accurately
estimates the generalization error, and it does not necessarily grow with the
number of parameters unlike the existing capacity metrics in the literature.</span>

homophily, i.e., strong similarities in local neighborhoods. This assumption
however limits the generalizability power of GNNs. To address this limitation,
we propose a flexible GNN model, which is capable of handling any graphs
without being restricted by their underlying homophily. At its core, this model
adopts a node attention mechanism based on multiple learnable spectral filters;
therefore, the aggregation scheme is learned adaptively for each graph in the
spectral domain. We evaluated the proposed model on node classification tasks
over eight benchmark datasets. The proposed model is shown to generalize well
to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Further, it outperforms all

the improvement of DeepFake generation methods. Simultaneously, we have seen
detection models&#x27; development for differentiating between a manipulated and
original face from image or video content. We have observed that most publicly
available DeepFake detection datasets have limited variations, where a single
face is used in many videos, resulting in an oversampled training dataset. Due
to this, deep neural networks tend to overfit to the facial features instead of
learning to detect manipulation features of DeepFake content. As a result, most
detection architectures perform poorly when tested on unseen data. In this
paper, we provide a quantitative analysis to investigate this problem and
present a solution to prevent model overfitting due to the high volume of
samples generated from a small number of actors. We introduce Face-Cutout, a
data augmentation method for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to
improve DeepFake detection. In this method, training images with various
occlusions are dynamically generated using face landmark information
irrespective of orientation. Unlike other general-purpose augmentation methods,
it focuses on the facial information that is crucial for DeepFake detection.
Our method achieves a reduction in LogLoss of 15.2% to 35.3% on different
datasets, compared to other occlusion-based augmentation techniques. We show
that Face-Cutout can be easily integrated with any CNN-based recognition model
and improve detection performance.</span>

function. The goal is to find the minimizer of the function by a sequential
exploration of its values, under measurement noise. We study the impact of
higher order smoothness properties of the function on the optimization error
and on the cumulative regret. To solve this problem we consider a randomized
approximation of the projected gradient descent algorithm. The gradient is
estimated by a randomized procedure involving two function evaluations and a
smoothing kernel. We derive upper bounds for this algorithm both in the
constrained and unconstrained settings and prove minimax lower bounds for any
sequential search method. Our results imply that the zero-order algorithm is
nearly optimal in terms of sample complexity and the problem parameters. Based
on this algorithm, we also propose an estimator of the minimum value of the
function achieving almost sharp oracle behavior. We compare our results with
the state-of-the-art, highlighting a number of key improvements.</span>

discriminative and generative learning at a latent space level for
semi-supervised few-shot classification. Various tasks for classifying new
species from image data can be modeled as a semi-supervised few-shot
classification, which assumes a labeled and unlabeled training examples and a
small support set of the target classes. Predicting target classes with a few
support examples per class makes the learning task difficult for existing
semi-supervised classification methods, including selftraining, which
iteratively estimates class labels of unlabeled training examples to learn a
classifier for the training classes. To exploit unlabeled training examples
effectively, we adopt as the objective function the composite likelihood, which
integrates discriminative and generative learning and suits better with deep
neural networks than the parameter coupling prior, the other popular integrated
learning approach. In our proposed model, the discriminative and generative
models are respectively Prototypical Networks, which have shown excellent
performance in various kinds of few-shot learning, and Normalizing Flow a deep
invertible model which returns the exact marginal likelihood unlike the other
three major methods, i.e., VAE, GAN, and autoregressive model. Our main
originality lies in our integration of these components at a latent space
level, which is effective in preventing overfitting. Experiments using
mini-ImageNet and VGG-Face datasets show that our method outperforms
selftraining based Prototypical Networks.</span>

with extreme impact on patients and healthcare systems and is the second
largest cause of death worldwide. Fast and precise stroke lesion detection and
location is an extreme important process with regards to stroke diagnosis,
treatment, and prognosis. Except from the manual segmentation approach, machine
learning based segmentation methods are the most promising ones when
considering efficiency and accuracy, and convolutional neural network based
models are the first of its kind. However, most of these neural network models
do not really align with the brain anatomical structures. Intuitively, this
work presents a more brain alike model which mimics the anatomical structure of
the human visual cortex. Through the preliminary experiments on the stroke

equally well or better to the de-facto standard U-Net. Part of the

learning (IRL) algorithm aims to learn from and outperform the demonstrator. In
sharp contrast to the conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,
BD-IRL can overcome the dilemma incurred in the reward function design and
improve the exploration mechanism of RL, which opens new avenues to building
superior expert systems. Most existing BD-IRL algorithms are performed in two
stages by first inferring a reward function before learning a policy via RL.
However, such two-stage BD-IRL algorithms suffer from high computational
complexity, weak robustness, and large performance variations. In particular, a
poor reward function derived in the first stage will inevitably incur severe
performance loss in the second stage. In this work, we propose a hybrid
adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (HAIRL) algorithm that is one-stage,
model-free, generative-adversarial (GA) fashion and curiosity-driven. Thanks to
the one-stage design, the HAIRL can integrate both the reward function learning
and the policy optimization into one procedure, which leads to many advantages
such as low computational complexity, high robustness, and strong adaptability.
More specifically, HAIRL simultaneously imitates the demonstrator and explores
BD performance by utilizing hybrid rewards. In particular, the Wasserstein-1
distance (WD) is introduced into HAIRL to stabilize the imitation procedure
while a novel end-to-end curiosity module (ECM) is developed to improve the
exploration. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm that HAIRL can
achieve higher performance as compared to other similar BD-IRL algorithms. Our
code is available at our GitHub website

workflows, IT systems, Web services and direct collaborations of people.
Accordingly, process data (i.e., BP execution data such as logs containing
events, interaction messages and other process artifacts) is scattered across
several systems and data sources, and increasingly show all typical properties
of the Big Data. Understanding the execution of process data is challenging as
key business insights remain hidden in the interactions among process entities:
most objects are interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often
semi-structured networks. In the context of business processes, we consider the
Big Data problem as a massive number of interconnected data islands from
personal, shared and business data. We present a framework to model process
data as graphs, i.e., Process Graph, and present abstractions to summarize the
process graph and to discover concept hierarchies for entities based on both
data objects and their interactions in process graphs. We present a language,
namely BP-SPARQL, for the explorative querying and understanding of process
graphs from various user perspectives. We have implemented a scalable
architecture for querying, exploration and analysis of process graphs. We

SQL injection vulnerabilities. We consider a simplification of the dynamics of
SQL injection attacks by casting this problem as a security capture-the-flag
challenge. We model it as a Markov decision process, and we implement it as a
reinforcement learning problem. We then deploy reinforcement learning agents
tasked with learning an effective policy to perform SQL injection; we design
our training in such a way that the agent learns not just a specific strategy
to solve an individual challenge but a more generic policy that may be applied
to perform SQL injection attacks against any system instantiated randomly by
our problem generator. We analyze the results in terms of the quality of the
learned policy and in terms of convergence time as a function of the complexity
of the challenge and the learning agent&#x27;s complexity. Our work fits in the
wider research on the development of intelligent agents for autonomous
penetration testing and white-hat hacking, and our results aim to contribute to

sophisticated architectures rather than the classical multilayer perceptron
(MLP). Residual networks (ResNets) stand out among these powerful modern
architectures. Previous works focused on the optimization advantages of deep
ResNets over deep MLPs. In this paper, we show another distinction between the
two models, namely, a tendency of ResNets to promote smoother interpolations
than MLPs. We analyze this phenomenon via the neural tangent kernel (NTK)
approach. First, we compute the NTK for a considered ResNet model and prove its
stability during gradient descent training. Then, we show by various evaluation
methodologies that for ReLU activations the NTK of ResNet, and its kernel
regression results, are smoother than the ones of MLP. The better smoothness
observed in our analysis may explain the better generalization ability of
ResNets and the practice of moderately attenuating the residual blocks.</span>

                                        <span>Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing and
is at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications,
neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view
synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental
obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and
memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the
rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring
hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate
those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic
integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to
integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate
the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The
graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble
the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the
fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite
integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural
rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality:
improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly
reduced image quality.</span>

                                        <span>Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning tools
developed to solve classification problems. However, SVMs are likely to perform
poorly in the classification of imbalanced data. The rough set theory presents
a mathematical tool for inference in nondeterministic cases that provides
methods for removing irrelevant information from data. In this work, we propose
an approach that efficiently used fuzzy rough set theory in weighted least
squares twin support vector machine called FRLSTSVM for classification of
imbalanced data. The first innovation is introducing a new fuzzy rough
set-based under-sampling strategy to make the classifier robust in terms of the
imbalanced data. For constructing the two proximal hyperplanes in FRLSTSVM,
data points from the minority class remain unchanged while a subset of data
points in the majority class are selected using a new method. In this model, we
embed the weight biases in the LSTSVM formulations to overcome the bias
phenomenon in the original twin SVM for the classification of imbalanced data.
In order to determine these weights in this formulation, we introduce a new
strategy that uses fuzzy rough set theory as the second innovation.
Experimental results on the famous imbalanced datasets, compared to the related
traditional SVM-based methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
FRLSTSVM model in the imbalanced data classification.</span>

of tasks while such success relies heavily on the massive and carefully labeled
data. However, precise annotations are generally very expensive and
time-consuming. To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is
emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through
well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey,
we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer

existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and
predictive. More importantly, unlike many other surveys that only provide a
high-level description of published research, we present an additional
mathematical summary of the existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore,
to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also
summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, and

                                        <span>The bus system is a critical component of sustainable urban transportation.
However, due to the significant uncertainties in passenger demand and traffic
conditions, bus operation is unstable in nature and bus bunching has become a
common phenomenon that undermines the reliability and efficiency of bus
services. Despite recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
on traffic control, little research has focused on bus fleet control due to the
tricky asynchronous characteristic -- control actions only happen when a bus
arrives at a bus stop and thus agents do not act simultaneously. In this study,
we formulate route-level bus fleet control as an asynchronous multi-agent
reinforcement learning (ASMR) problem and extend the classical actor-critic
architecture to handle the asynchronous issue. Specifically, we design a novel
critic network to effectively approximate the marginal contribution for other
agents, in which graph attention neural network is used to conduct inductive
learning for policy evaluation. The critic structure also helps the ego agent
optimize its policy more efficiently. We evaluate the proposed framework on
real-world bus services and actual passenger demand derived from smart card
data. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional
headway-based control methods and existing MARL methods.</span>

                                        <span>This paper considers joint learning of multiple sparse Granger graphical
models to discover underlying common and differential Granger causality (GC)
structures across multiple time series. This can be applied to drawing
group-level brain connectivity inferences from a homogeneous group of subjects
or discovering network differences among groups of signals collected under
heterogeneous conditions. By recognizing that the GC of a single multivariate
time series can be characterized by common zeros of vector autoregressive (VAR)
lag coefficients, a group sparse prior is included in joint regularized
least-squares estimations of multiple VAR models. Group-norm regularizations
based on group- and fused-lasso penalties encourage a decomposition of multiple
networks into a common GC structure, with other remaining parts defined in
individual-specific networks. Prior information about sparseness and sparsity
patterns of desired GC networks are incorporated as relative weights, while a
non-convex group norm in the penalty is proposed to enhance the accuracy of
network estimation in low-sample settings. Extensive numerical results on
simulations illustrated our method&#x27;s improvements over existing sparse
estimation approaches on GC network sparsity recovery. Our methods were also
applied to available resting-state fMRI time series from the ADHD-200 data sets
to learn the differences of causality mechanisms, called effective brain
connectivity, between adolescents with ADHD and typically developing children.
Our analysis revealed that parts of the causality differences between the two
groups often resided in the orbitofrontal region and areas associated with the
limbic system, which agreed with clinical findings and data-driven results in
previous studies.</span>

However, most existing studies fuse all structural features and node attributes
to provide an overarching view of graphs, neglecting finer substructures&#x27;
semantics, and suffering from interpretation enigmas. This paper presents a
novel hierarchical subgraph-level selection and embedding based graph neural
network for graph classification, namely SUGAR, to learn more discriminative
subgraph representations and respond in an explanatory way. SUGAR reconstructs
a sketched graph by extracting striking subgraphs as the representative part of
the original graph to reveal subgraph-level patterns. To adaptively select
striking subgraphs without prior knowledge, we develop a reinforcement pooling
mechanism, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To
differentiate subgraph representations among graphs, we present a
self-supervised mutual information mechanism to encourage subgraph embedding to
be mindful of the global graph structural properties by maximizing their mutual
information. Extensive experiments on six typical bioinformatics datasets
demonstrate a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with
competitive performance and interpretability.</span>

However, for robots with many degrees-of-freedom, these methods exhibit poor
generalization across different environments and often require large datasets
that are impractical to gather. We present SPARK and FLAME , two
experience-based frameworks for sampling-based planning applicable to complex
manipulators in 3 D environments. Both combine samplers associated with
features from a workspace decomposition into a global biased sampling
distribution. SPARK decomposes the environment based on exact geometry while
FLAME is more general, and uses an octree-based decomposition obtained from
sensor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPARK and FLAME on a Fetch
robot tasked with challenging pick-and-place manipulation problems. Our
approaches can be trained incrementally and significantly improve performance
with only a handful of examples, generalizing better over diverse tasks and
environments as compared to prior approaches.</span>

systems with multiplicatively separable parametrization, called aNCM - for
adaptive Neural Contraction Metric. The framework utilizes a deep neural
network to approximate a stabilizing adaptive control law parameterized by an
optimal contraction metric. The use of deep networks permits real-time
implementation of the control law and broad applicability to a variety of
systems, including systems modeled with basis function approximation methods.
We show using contraction theory that aNCM ensures exponential boundedness of
the distance between the target and controlled trajectories even under the
presence of the parametric uncertainty, robustly to the learning errors caused
by aNCM approximation as well as external additive disturbances. Its
superiority to the existing robust and adaptive control methods is demonstrated
in a simple cart-pole balancing task.</span>

                                        <span>Image-to-image translation aims to preserve source contents while translating
to discriminative target styles between two visual domains. Most works apply
adversarial learning in the ambient image space, which could be computationally
expensive and challenging to train. In this paper, we propose to deploy an
energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder for
this task. The pretrained autoencoder serves as both a latent code extractor
and an image reconstruction worker. Our model, LETIT, is based on the
assumption that two domains share the same latent space, where latent
representation is implicitly decomposed as a content code and a domain-specific
style code. Instead of explicitly extracting the two codes and applying
adaptive instance normalization to combine them, our latent EBM can implicitly
learn to transport the source style code to the target style code while
preserving the content code, an advantage over existing image translation
methods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in the one-sided
unpaired image translation setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons
demonstrate superior translation quality and faithfulness for content
preservation. Our model is the first to be applicable to
1024$\times$1024-resolution unpaired image translation to the best of our
knowledge.</span>

in pattern recognition. Part of this success can be attributed to the reliance
on big data to increase generalization. However, in the field of time series
recognition, many datasets are often very small. One method of addressing this
problem is through the use of data augmentation. In this paper, we survey data
augmentation techniques for time series and their application to time series
classification with neural networks. We outline four families of time series
data augmentation, including transformation-based methods, pattern mixing,
generative models, and decomposition methods, and detail their taxonomy.
Furthermore, we empirically evaluate 12 time series data augmentation methods
on 128 time series classification datasets with 6 different types of neural
networks. Through the results, we are able to analyze the characteristics,
advantages and disadvantages, and recommendations of each data augmentation
method. This survey aims to help in the selection of time series data
augmentation for neural network applications.</span>

Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which can be viewed as a non-Bayesian

novel proof technique for deriving lower bounds on the regret, with benefits
including simplicity, versatility, and an improved dependence on the error
probability. In a robust setting in which every sampled point may be perturbed
by a suitably-constrained adversary, we provide a novel lower bound for
deterministic strategies, demonstrating an inevitable joint dependence of the
cumulative regret on the corruption level and the time horizon, in contrast
with existing lower bounds that only characterize the individual dependencies.
Furthermore, in a distinct robust setting in which the final point is perturbed
by an adversary, we strengthen an existing lower bound that only holds for
target success probabilities very close to one, by allowing for arbitrary
success probabilities above $\frac{2}{3}$.</span>

resource-constrained platforms. However, training deep learning models with
low-precision weights and activations involves a demanding optimization task,
which calls for minimizing a stage-wise loss function subject to a discrete
set-constraint. While numerous training methods have been proposed, existing
studies for full quantization of DNNs are mostly empirical. From a theoretical
point of view, we study practical techniques for overcoming the combinatorial
nature of network quantization. Specifically, we investigate a simple yet
powerful projected gradient-like algorithm for quantizing two-linear-layer
networks, which proceeds by repeatedly moving one step at float weights in the
negation of a heuristic \emph{fake} gradient of the loss function (so-called
coarse gradient) evaluated at quantized weights. For the first time, we prove
that under mild conditions, the sequence of quantized weights recurrently
visits the global optimum of the discrete minimization problem for training
fully quantized network. We also show numerical evidence of the recurrence
phenomenon of weight evolution in training quantized deep networks.</span>

task-specific architectures and objectives for each task. For example, a
multi-label answer classifier for visual question answering, a region scorer
for referring expression comprehension, and a language decoder for image
captioning, etc. To alleviate these hassles, in this work, we propose a unified
framework that learns different tasks in a single architecture with the same
language modeling objective, i.e., multimodal conditional text generation,
where our models learn to generate labels in text based on the visual and
textual inputs. On 7 popular vision-and-language benchmarks, including visual
question answering, referring expression comprehension, visual commonsense
reasoning, most of which have been previously modeled as discriminative tasks,
our generative approach (with a single unified architecture) reaches comparable
performance to recent task-specific state-of-the-art vision-and-language
models. Moreover, our generative approach shows better generalization ability
on questions that have rare answers. Also, we show that our framework allows
multi-task learning in a single architecture with a single set of parameters,
achieving similar performance to separately optimized single-task models. Our

critical aspect of protein function. CryoEM provides direct visualization of
individual macromolecules sampling different conformational and compositional
states. While numerous methods are available for computational classification
of discrete states, characterization of continuous conformational changes or
large numbers of discrete state without human supervision remains challenging.
Here we present e2gmm, a machine learning algorithm to determine a
conformational landscape for proteins or complexes using a 3-D Gaussian mixture
model mapped onto 2-D particle images in known orientations. Using a deep
neural network architecture, e2gmm can automatically resolve the structural
heterogeneity within the protein complex and map particles onto a small latent
space describing conformational and compositional changes. This system presents
a more intuitive and flexible representation than other manifold methods
currently in use. We demonstrate this method on both simulated data as well as
three biological systems, to explore compositional and conformational changes
at a range of scales. The software is distributed as part of EMAN2.</span>

                                        <span>It is well-known that standard neural networks, even with a high
classification accuracy, are vulnerable to small $\ell_\infty$-norm bounded
adversarial perturbations. Although many attempts have been made, most previous
works either can only provide empirical verification of the defense to a
particular attack method, or can only develop a certified guarantee of the
model robustness in limited scenarios. In this paper, we seek for a new
approach to develop a theoretically principled neural network that inherently
resists $\ell_\infty$ perturbations. In particular, we design a novel neuron
that uses $\ell_\infty$-distance as its basic operation (which we call
$\ell_\infty$-dist neuron), and show that any neural network constructed with
$\ell_\infty$-dist neurons (called $\ell_{\infty}$-dist net) is naturally a
1-Lipschitz function with respect to $\ell_\infty$-norm. This directly provides
a rigorous guarantee of the certified robustness based on the margin of
prediction outputs. We also prove that such networks have enough expressive
power to approximate any 1-Lipschitz function with robust generalization
guarantee. Our experimental results show that the proposed network is
promising. Using $\ell_{\infty}$-dist nets as the basic building blocks, we
consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance on commonly used datasets:
93.09% certified accuracy on MNIST ($\epsilon&#x3D;0.3$), 79.23% on Fashion MNIST
($\epsilon&#x3D;0.1$) and 35.10% on CIFAR-10 ($\epsilon&#x3D;8/255$).</span>

                                        <span>We present a deep learning based joint source channel coding (JSCC) scheme
for wireless image transmission over multipath fading channels with non-linear
signal clipping. The proposed encoder and decoder use convolutional neural
networks (CNN) and directly map the source images to complex-valued baseband
samples for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. The
proposed model-driven machine learning approach eliminates the need for
separate source and channel coding while integrating an OFDM datapath to cope
with multipath fading channels. The end-to-end JSCC communication system
combines trainable CNN layers with non-trainable but differentiable layers
representing the multipath channel model and OFDM signal processing blocks. Our
results show that injecting domain expert knowledge by incorporating OFDM
baseband processing blocks into the machine learning framework significantly
enhances the overall performance compared to an unstructured CNN. Our method
outperforms conventional schemes that employ state-of-the-art but separate
source and channel coding such as BPG and LDPC with OFDM. Moreover, our method
is shown to be robust against non-linear signal clipping in OFDM for various
channel conditions that do not match the model parameter used during the
training.</span>

                                        <span>Most stochastic gradient descent algorithms can optimize neural networks that
are sub-differentiable in their parameters, which requires their activation
function to exhibit a degree of continuity. However, this continuity constraint
on the activation function prevents these neural models from uniformly
approximating discontinuous functions. This paper focuses on the case where the
discontinuities arise from distinct sub-patterns, each defined on different
parts of the input space. We propose a new discontinuous deep neural network
model trainable via a decoupled two-step procedure that avoids passing gradient
updates through the network&#x27;s non-differentiable unit. We provide universal
approximation guarantees for our architecture in the space of bounded
continuous functions and in the space of piecewise continuous functions, which
we introduced herein. We present a novel semi-supervised two-step training
procedure for our discontinuous deep learning model, and we provide theoretical
support for its effectiveness. The performance of our architecture is evaluated
experimentally on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Modern, complex software systems are being continuously extended and
adjusted. The developers responsible for this may come from different teams or
organizations, and may be distributed over the world. This may make it
difficult to keep track of what other developers are doing, which may result in
multiple developers concurrently editing the same code areas. This, in turn,
may lead to hard-to-merge changes or even merge conflicts, logical bugs that
are difficult to detect, duplication of work, and wasted developer
productivity. To address this, we explore the extent of this problem in the
pull request based software development model. We study half a year of changes
made to six large repositories in Microsoft in which at least 1,000 pull
requests are created each month. We find that files concurrently edited in
different pull requests are more likely to introduce bugs. Motivated by these
findings, we design, implement, and deploy a service named ConE (Concurrent
Edit Detector) that proactively detects pull requests containing concurrent
edits, to help mitigate the problems caused by them. ConE has been designed to
scale, and to minimize false alarms while still flagging relevant concurrently
edited files. Key concepts of ConE include the detection of the Extent of
Overlap between pull requests, and the identification of Rarely Concurrently
Edited Files. To evaluate ConE, we report on its operational deployment on 234
repositories inside Microsoft. ConE assessed 26,000 pull requests and made 775
recommendations about conflicting changes, which were rated as useful in over
70% (554) of the cases. From interviews with 48 users we learned that they
believed ConE would save time in conflict resolution and avoiding duplicate
work, and that over 90% intend to keep using the service on a daily basis.</span>

datasets to facilitate scalable, comprehensive, and reproducible federated
learning (FL) research. FedScale datasets are large-scale, encompassing a
diverse range of important FL tasks, such as image classification, object
detection, language modeling, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.
For each dataset, we provide a unified evaluation protocol using realistic data
splits and evaluation metrics. To meet the pressing need for reproducing
realistic FL at scale, we have also built an efficient evaluation platform to
simplify and standardize the process of FL experimental setup and model
evaluation. Our evaluation platform provides flexible APIs to implement new FL
algorithms and include new execution backends with minimal developer efforts.
Finally, we perform indepth benchmark experiments on these datasets. Our
experiments suggest that FedScale presents significant challenges of
heterogeneity-aware co-optimizations of the system and statistical efficiency
under realistic FL characteristics, indicating fruitful opportunities for
future research. FedScale is open-source with permissive licenses and actively

sim-to-real transfer can help satisfy the large data requirements. In this
paper, we study the problem of zero-shot sim-to-real when the task requires
both highly precise control, with sub-millimetre error tolerance, and full
workspace generalisation. Our framework involves a coarse-to-fine controller,
where trajectories initially begin with classical motion planning based on pose
estimation, and transition to an end-to-end controller which maps images to
actions and is trained in simulation with domain randomisation. In this way, we
achieve precise control whilst also generalising the controller across the
workspace and keeping the generality and robustness of vision-based, end-to-end
control. Real-world experiments on a range of different tasks show that, by
exploiting the best of both worlds, our framework significantly outperforms
purely motion planning methods, and purely learning-based methods. Furthermore,
we answer a range of questions on best practices for precise sim-to-real
transfer, such as how different image sensor modalities and image feature
representations perform.</span>

                                        <span>Learning from label proportions (LLP) aims at learning an instance-level
classifier with label proportions in grouped training data. Existing deep
learning based LLP methods utilize end-to-end pipelines to obtain the
proportional loss with Kullback-Leibler divergence between the bag-level prior
and posterior class distributions. However, the unconstrained optimization on
this objective can hardly reach a solution in accordance with the given
proportions. Besides, concerning the probabilistic classifier, this strategy
unavoidably results in high-entropy conditional class distributions at the
instance level. These issues further degrade the performance of the
instance-level classification. In this paper, we regard these problems as noisy
pseudo labeling, and instead impose the strict proportion consistency on the
classifier with a constrained optimization as a continuous training stage for
existing LLP classifiers. In addition, we introduce the mixup strategy and
symmetric crossentropy to further reduce the label noise. Our framework is
model-agnostic, and demonstrates compelling performance improvement in
extensive experiments, when incorporated into other deep LLP models as a
post-hoc phase.</span>

                                        <span>Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node embeddings using the
framework of message passing and aggregation. Such GNNs are incapable of
learning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs
with the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then,
using the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative
positions between nodes. However, P-GNNs arbitrarily select anchors, leading to
compromising position-awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this
compromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric
anchors is essential. On the other hand, we show that choosing anchors that can
aggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-hard. Therefore,
devising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is
practically not feasible. To ensure position-awareness and bypass
NP-completeness, we propose Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks (PSGNNs),
learning how to choose anchors in a back-propagatable fashion. Experiments
verify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially
improving performance on various synthetic and real-world graph datasets while
enjoying stable scalability. Specifically, PSGNNs on average boost AUC more
than 14% for pairwise node classification and 18% for link prediction over the
existing state-of-the-art position-aware methods. Our source code is publicly

                                        <span>Digital contents have grown dramatically in recent years, leading to
increased attention to copyright. Image watermarking has been considered one of
the most popular methods for copyright protection. With the recent advancements
in applying deep neural networks in image processing, these networks have also
been used in image watermarking. Robustness and imperceptibility are two
challenging features of watermarking methods that the trade-off between them
should be satisfied. In this paper, we propose to use an end-to-end network for
watermarking. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to control the
embedding strength based on the image content. Dynamic embedding helps the
network to have the lowest effect on the visual quality of the watermarked
image. Different image processing attacks are simulated as a network layer to
improve the robustness of the model. Our method is a blind watermarking
approach that replicates the watermark string to create a matrix of the same
size as the input image. Instead of diffusing the watermark data into the input
image, we inject the data into the feature space and force the network to do
this in regions that increase the robustness against various attacks.
Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of
imperceptibility and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain,
has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been
backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function
with respect to the weights in the neural network model, in combination with
its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in
digital computers is intrinsically wasteful, with energy consumption becoming
prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development
of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and
integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing
systems. The learning process in these material systems, taking place, e.g., by
artificial evolution or surrogate neural network modelling, is still a
complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and
accurate homodyne gradient extraction method for performing gradient descent on
the loss function directly in the material system. We demonstrate the method in
our recently developed dopant network processing units, where we readily
realize all Boolean gates. This shows that gradient descent can in principle be
fully implemented in materio using simple electronics, opening up the way to
autonomously learning material systems.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a system of several collocated nodes sharing a time slotted
wireless channel, and seek a MAC that (i) provides low mean delay, (ii) has
distributed control (i.e., there is no central scheduler), and (iii) does not
require explicit exchange of state information or control signals. The design
of such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light
traffic, and scheduled access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing
interest in hybrid, adaptive MACs.

We first propose EZMAC, a simple extension of an existing decentralized,
hybrid MAC called ZMAC. Next, motivated by our results on delay and throughput
optimality in partially observed, constrained queuing networks, we develop
another decentralized MAC protocol that we term QZMAC. A method to improve the
short-term fairness of QZMAC is proposed and analysed, and the resulting
modified algorithm is shown to possess better fairness properties than QZMAC.
The theory developed to reduce delay is also shown to work %with different
traffic types (batch arrivals, for example) and even in the presence of
transmission errors and fast fading.

Extensions to handle time critical traffic (alarms, for example) and hidden
nodes are also discussed. Practical implementation issues, such as handling
Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) errors, are outlined. We implement and
demonstrate the performance of QZMAC on a test bed consisting of CC2420 based
Crossbow telosB motes, running the 6TiSCH communication stack on the Contiki
operating system over the 2.4GHz ISM band.

Finally, using simulations, we show that both protocols achieve mean delays
much lower than those achieved by ZMAC, and QZMAC provides mean delays very
close to the minimum achievable in this setting, i.e., that of the centralized
complete knowledge scheduler.</span>

large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication
overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the
communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local
update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and
computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between
communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and
balancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their
impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises
significantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to
minimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update
coefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize
trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We
then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time
considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),
that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning
error. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster
than similar schemes existing in the literature.</span>

first check if the information is densest within some small region. We say this
since, in 240 GitHub projects, we find that the information in that data
&#x60;&#x60;clumps&#x27;&#x27; towards the earliest parts of the project. In fact, a defect
prediction model learned from just the first 150 commits works as well, or
better than state-of-the-art alternatives. Using just this early life cycle
data, we can build models very quickly (using weeks, not months, of CPU time).
Also, we can find simple models (with just two features) that generalize to
hundreds of software projects. Based on this experience, we warn that prior
work on generalizing software engineering defect prediction models may have
needlessly complicated an inherently simple process. Further, prior work that
focused on later-life cycle data now needs to be revisited since their

data has attracted great attention in the machine learning community. In this

theoretically show that a model robust to input perturbation generalizes well
on OOD data. Inspired by previous findings that adversarial training helps
improve input-robustness, we theoretically show that adversarially trained
models have converged excess risk on OOD data, and empirically verify it on
both image classification and natural language understanding tasks. Besides, in
the paradigm of first pre-training and then fine-tuning, we theoretically show
that a pre-trained model that is more robust to input perturbation provides a
better initialization for generalization on downstream OOD data. Empirically,
after fine-tuning, this better-initialized model from adversarial pre-training
also has better OOD generalization.</span>

                                        <span>Algorithmic fairness is becoming increasingly important in data mining and
machine learning, and one of the most fundamental notions is group fairness.
The vast majority of the existing works on group fairness, with a few
exceptions, primarily focus on debiasing with respect to a single sensitive
attribute, despite the fact that the co-existence of multiple sensitive
attributes (e.g., gender, race, marital status, etc.) in the real-world is
commonplace. As such, methods that can ensure a fair learning outcome with
respect to all sensitive attributes of concern simultaneously need to be
developed. In this paper, we study multi-group fairness in machine learning
(MultiFair), where statistical parity, a representative group fairness measure,
is guaranteed among demographic groups formed by multiple sensitive attributes
of interest. We formulate it as a mutual information minimization problem and
propose a generic end-to-end algorithmic framework to solve it. The key idea is
to leverage a variational representation of mutual information, which considers
the variational distribution between learning outcomes and sensitive
attributes, as well as the density ratio between the variational and the
original distributions. Our proposed framework is generalizable to many
different settings, including other statistical notions of fairness, and could
handle any type of learning task equipped with a gradient-based optimizer.
Empirical evaluations in the fair classification task on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively debias the
classification results with minimal impact to the classification accuracy.</span>

financial crimes. In this context, financial services firms started to improve
their vigilance and use new technologies and approaches to identify and predict
financial fraud and crime possibilities. This task is challenging as
institutions need to upgrade their data and analytics capabilities to enable
new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict and detect
financial crimes. In this paper, we put a step towards AI-enabled financial
crime detection in general and money laundering detection in particular to
address this challenge. We study and analyse the recent works done in financial
crime detection and present a novel model to detect money laundering cases with
minimum human intervention needs.</span>

                                        <span>A graph neural network (GNN) enables deep learning on structured graph data.
There are two major GNN training obstacles: 1) it relies on high-end servers
with many GPUs which are expensive to purchase and maintain, and 2) limited
memory on GPUs cannot scale to today&#x27;s billion-edge graphs. This paper presents
Dorylus: a distributed system for training GNNs. Uniquely, Dorylus can take
advantage of serverless computing to increase scalability at a low cost.

The key insight guiding our design is computation separation. Computation
separation makes it possible to construct a deep, bounded-asynchronous pipeline
where graph and tensor parallel tasks can fully overlap, effectively hiding the
network latency incurred by Lambdas. With the help of thousands of Lambda
threads, Dorylus scales GNN training to billion-edge graphs. Currently, for
large graphs, CPU servers offer the best performance-per-dollar over GPU
servers. Just using Lambdas on top of CPU servers offers up to 2.75x more
performance-per-dollar than training only with CPU servers. Concretely, Dorylus
is 1.22x faster and 4.83x cheaper than GPU servers for massive sparse graphs.
Dorylus is up to 3.8x faster and 10.7x cheaper compared to existing
sampling-based systems.</span>

                                        <span>Sequences of events including infectious disease outbreaks, social network
activities, and crimes are ubiquitous and the data on such events carry
essential information about the underlying diffusion processes between
communities (e.g., regions, online user groups). Modeling diffusion processes
and predicting future events are crucial in many applications including
epidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes
offer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the
influence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However,
the triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced
by the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the
diffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also
the current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people&#x27;s awareness
of the disease and people&#x27;s current interests. In this paper, we propose a
novel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of
community states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of
events based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic
function that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks.
Then we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its
integral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a
flexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities&#x27;
states, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood,
which makes parameter learning tractable. Extensive experiments on four
real-world event datasets show that DHP outperforms five widely adopted methods
for event prediction.</span>

                                        <span>With the continuous development of the petroleum industry, long-distance
transportation of oil and gas has been the norm. Due to gravity differentiation
in horizontal wells and highly deviated wells (non-vertical wells), the water
phase at the bottom of the pipeline will cause scaling and corrosion in the
pipeline. Scaling and corrosion will make the transportation process difficult,
and transportation costs will be considerably increased. Therefore, the study
of the oil-water two-phase flow pattern is of great importance to oil
production. In this paper, a fuzzy inference system is used to predict the flow
pattern of the fluid, get the prediction result, and compares it with the
prediction result of the BP neural network. From the comparison of the results,
we found that the prediction results of the fuzzy inference system are more
accurate and reliable than the prediction results of the BP neural network. At
the same time, it can realize real-time monitoring and has less error control.
Experimental results demonstrate that in the entire production logging process
of non-vertical wells, the use of a fuzzy inference system to predict fluid
flow patterns can greatly save production costs while ensuring the safe
operation of production equipment.</span>

with noise injection to counter the wireless channel noise. We also employ
pruning to reduce the channel bandwidth necessary for transmission, and perform
knowledge distillation from a larger model to achieve satisfactory performance,

higher test accuracy compared to digital alternatives under the same bandwidth

autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) agents. While building such agents, one
needs to balance opposing desiderata, such as constraints on capacity and
compute, the ability to not catastrophically forget, and to exhibit positive
transfer on new tasks. Understanding the right trade-off is conceptually and
computationally challenging, which we argue has led the community to overly
focus on catastrophic forgetting. In response to these issues, we advocate for
the need to prioritize forward transfer and propose Continual World, a

                                        <span>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted great interest in the last few
years owing to their ability to cover large areas and access difficult and
hazardous target zones, which is not the case of traditional systems relying on
direct observations obtained from fixed cameras and sensors. Furthermore,
thanks to the advancements in computer vision and machine learning, UAVs are
being adopted for a broad range of solutions and applications. However, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) are progressing toward deeper and complex models that
prevent them from being executed on-board. In this paper, we propose a DNN
distribution methodology within UAVs to enable data classification in
resource-constrained devices and avoid extra delays introduced by the
server-based solutions due to data communication over air-to-ground links. The
proposed method is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize
the latency between data collection and decision-making while considering the
mobility model and the resource constraints of the UAVs as part of the
air-to-air communication. We also introduce the mobility prediction to adapt
our system to the dynamics of UAVs and the network variation. The simulation
conducted to evaluate the performance and benchmark the proposed methods,
namely Optimal UAV-based Layer Distribution (OULD) and OULD with Mobility
Prediction (OULD-MP), were run in an HPC cluster. The obtained results show
that our optimization solution outperforms the existing and heuristic-based
approaches.</span>

We separate the latent space of VAE with multi-modal property of the Gaussian
mixture distribution according to labels of observations. Next, we can easily
investigate the latent subspace by a simple statistics, known as
$F$-statistics, obtained from the EXoN. We found that both negative
cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence play a crucial role in
constructing explainable latent space and the variability of the generated
samples from our proposed model depends on a specific subspace, called
&#x60;activated latent subspace&#x27;. With MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset, we show that the
EXoN can produce explainable latent space which effectively represents labels
and characteristics of the images.</span>

                                        <span>Scientific document understanding is challenging as the data is highly domain
specific and diverse. However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require
expensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a
few fields. At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential
training signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled
datasets. Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection
in English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an
external source. To accomplish this, we introduce CiteWorth, a large,
contextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness
detection built from a massive corpus of extracted plain-text scientific
documents. We show that CiteWorth is high-quality, challenging, and suitable
for studying problems such as domain adaptation. Our best performing
cite-worthiness detection model is a paragraph-level contextualized sentence
labelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over
SciBERT which considers only individual sentences. Finally, we demonstrate that
language model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to
improved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.</span>

generation and distribution of information in today&#x27;s world. However, easy
access to information does not equal an increased level of public knowledge.
Unlike traditional media channels, social networks also facilitate faster and
wider spread of disinformation and misinformation. Viral spread of false
information has serious implications on the behaviors, attitudes and beliefs of
the public, and ultimately can seriously endanger the democratic processes.
Limiting false information&#x27;s negative impact through early detection and
control of extensive spread presents the main challenge facing researchers
today. In this survey paper, we extensively analyze a wide range of different
solutions for the early detection of fake news in the existing literature. More
precisely, we examine Machine Learning (ML) models for the identification and
classification of fake news, online fake news detection competitions,
statistical outputs as well as the advantages and disadvantages of some of the
available data sets. Finally, we evaluate the online web browsing tools
available for detecting and mitigating fake news and present some open research

                                        <span>As global trends are shifting towards data-driven industries, the demand for
automated algorithms that can convert digital images of scanned documents into
machine readable information is rapidly growing. Besides the opportunity of
data digitization for the application of data analytic tools, there is also a
massive improvement towards automation of processes, which previously would
require manual inspection of the documents. Although the introduction of
optical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting
human-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the
task of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years. The
recognition of tables consists of two main tasks, namely table detection and
table structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either
task without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real
application conditions like rotated images or noise artefacts inside the
document image. Recent work shows a clear trend towards deep learning
approaches coupled with the use of transfer learning for the task of table
structure recognition due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this
paper we present a multistage pipeline named Multi-Type-TD-TSR, which offers an
end-to-end solution for the problem of table recognition. It utilizes
state-of-the-art deep learning models for table detection and differentiates
between 3 different types of tables based on the tables&#x27; borders. For the table
structure recognition we use a deterministic non-data driven algorithm, which
works on all table types. We additionally present two algorithms. One for
unbordered tables and one for bordered tables, which are the base of the used
table structure recognition algorithm. We evaluate Multi-Type-TD-TSR on the
ICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset and achieve a new
state-of-the-art.</span>

values for the Shapley value in game theory. The Shapley value measures the
attribution of each input variable of a complex model, which is computed as the
marginal benefit from the presence of this variable w.r.t.its absence under
different contexts. To this end, people usually set the input variable to its
baseline value to represent the absence of this variable (i.e.the no-signal
state of this variable). Previous studies usually determine the baseline values
in an empirical manner, which hurts the trustworthiness of the Shapley value.
In this paper, we revisit the feature representation of a deep model from the
perspective of game theory, and define the multi-variate interaction patterns
of input variables to define the no-signal state of an input variable. Based on
the multi-variate interaction, we learn the optimal baseline value of each
input variable. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
method.</span>

various researches and applications in real industries. However, in some
privacy sensitive scenarios (like finance, healthcare), training a GNN model
centrally faces challenges due to the distributed data silos. Federated
learning (FL) is a an emerging technique that can collaboratively train a
shared model while keeping the data decentralized, which is a rational solution
for distributed GNN training. We term it as federated graph learning (FGL).
Although FGL has received increasing attention recently, the definition and
challenges of FGL is still up in the air. In this position paper, we present a
categorization to clarify it. Considering how graph data are distributed among
clients, we propose four types of FGL: inter-graph FL, intra-graph FL and
graph-structured FL, where intra-graph is further divided into horizontal and
vertical FGL. For each type of FGL, we make a detailed discussion about the
formulation and applications, and propose some potential challenges.</span>

navigation in unstructured environments. However, real-time constraints
frequently limit the accuracy of online tests, especially in scenarios where
realistic robot-terrain interactions are complex to model. In this context, we
propose a deep learning framework, trained in an end-to-end fashion from
elevation maps and trajectories, to estimate the occurrence of failure events.
The network is first trained and tested in simulation over synthetic maps
generated by the OpenSimplex algorithm. The prediction performance of the Deep
Learning framework is illustrated by being able to retain over 94% recall of
the original simulator at 30% of the computational time. Finally, the network
is transferred and tested on real elevation maps collected by the SEEKER
consortium during the Martian rover test trial in the Atacama desert in Chile.
We show that transferring and fine-tuning of an application-independent
pre-trained model retains better performance than training uniquely on scarcely
available real data.</span>

fraction of the training data is manipulated to degrade the algorithms&#x27;
performance. We show that current approaches, which typically assume that
regularization hyperparameters remain constant, lead to an overly pessimistic
view of the algorithms&#x27; robustness and of the impact of regularization. We
propose a novel optimal attack formulation that considers the effect of the
attack on the hyperparameters, modelling the attack as a \emph{minimax bilevel
optimization problem}. This allows to formulate optimal attacks, select
hyperparameters and evaluate robustness under worst case conditions. We apply
this formulation to logistic regression using $L_2$ regularization, empirically
show the limitations of previous strategies and evidence the benefits of using
$L_2$ regularization to dampen the effect of poisoning attacks.</span>

controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in real time while
avoiding inter-UAV collisions. To this end, we propose a novel multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework, coined a graph attention exchange
network (GAXNet). In GAXNet, each UAV constructs an attention graph locally
measuring the level of attention to its neighboring UAVs, while exchanging the
attention weights with other UAVs so as to reduce the attention mismatch
between them. Simulation results corroborates that GAXNet achieves up to 4.5x
higher rewards during training. At execution, without incurring inter-UAV
collisions, GAXNet achieves 6.5x lower latency with the target 0.0000001 error

the recurrent neural network (RNN), are strongly desired for their application
to edge-computing devices. However, the recurrent architecture is generally not
robust to pruning because even small pruning causes accumulation error and the
total error increases significantly over time. In this paper, we propose an
appropriate pruning algorithm for RNNs inspired by &quot;spectral pruning&quot;, and
provide the generalization error bounds for compressed RNNs. We also provide
numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical results and show the

theory, physics, and econometrics as models of correlated systems, among other
domains. Further, heavy-tail distributed eigenvalues of the covariance matrix
of the weight matrices in neural networks have been shown to empirically
correlate with test set accuracy in several works (e.g. arXiv:1901.08276), but
a formal relationship between heavy-tail distributed parameters and
generalization bounds was yet to be demonstrated. In this work, the compression
framework of arXiv:1802.05296 is utilized to show that matrices with heavy-tail
distributed matrix elements can be compressed, resulting in networks with
sparse weight matrices. Since the parameter count has been reduced to a sum of
the non-zero elements of sparse matrices, the compression framework allows us
to bound the generalization gap of the resulting compressed network with a
non-vacuous generalization bound. Further, the action of these matrices on a
vector is discussed, and how they may relate to compression and resilient
classification is analyzed.</span>

dynamical system in a Euclidean space of appropriate dimension through a
generic delay-observation map. The embedding also establishes a topological
conjugacy. In this paper, we show how an arbitrary sequence can be mapped into
another space as an attractive solution of a nonautonomous dynamical system.
Such mapping also entails a topological conjugacy and an embedding between the
sequence and the attractive solution spaces. This result is not a
generalization of Takens embedding theorem but helps us understand what exactly
is required by discrete-time state space models widely used in applications to
embed an external stimulus onto its solution space. Our results settle another
basic problem concerning the perturbation of an autonomous dynamical system. We
describe what exactly happens to the dynamics when exogenous noise perturbs
continuously a local irreducible attracting set (such as a stable fixed point)
of a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system.</span>

                                        <span>The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters
needing careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least
automated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant
manual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and
optimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be
tuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the
question: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without
human involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically
optimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS
aims to find an LR applied to every $\tau$ steps that minimizes the resulted
validation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian
optimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a
system to evaluate each LR queried by BO&#x27;s acquisition function for $\tau$
steps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each
candidate LR for only $\tau&#x27;\ll\tau$ steps and train an exponential model to
predict the validation loss after $\tau$ steps. This mutual-training process
between BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps
invested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of
AutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse
domains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS
lead to a speedup of $1.22\times$, $1.43\times$, and $1.5\times$ when training
ResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in
their original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\times$ over
state-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.</span>

                                        <span>We present a general technique for constructing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
capable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on
mode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE
identifies a most-specific logical formula $\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the
relational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We transform $\bot_B(e)$
into a corresponding &quot;bottom-graph&quot; that can be processed for use by standard
GNN implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of
incorporating generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term &#x60;BotGNN&#x27;
for this form of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using
real-world datasets with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs
perform significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a
recently proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into
GNNs. We also provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a
&quot;propositionalised&quot; form of the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard
ILP based on the use of most-specific clauses. Taken together, these results
point to BotGNNs as capable of combining the computational efficacy of GNNs
with the representational versatility of ILP.</span>

                                        <span>Contending hate speech in social media is one of the most challenging social
problems of our time. There are various types of anti-social behavior in social
media. Foremost of them is aggressive behavior, which is causing many social
issues such as affecting the social lives and mental health of social media
users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ensemble-based architecture to
automatically identify and classify aggressive tweets. Tweets are classified
into three categories - Covertly Aggressive, Overtly Aggressive, and
Non-Aggressive. The proposed architecture is an ensemble of smaller subnetworks
that are able to characterize the feature embeddings effectively. We
demonstrate qualitatively that each of the smaller subnetworks is able to learn
unique features. Our best model is an ensemble of Capsule Networks and results
in a 65.2% F1 score on the Facebook test set, which results in a performance
gain of 0.95% over the TRAC-2018 winners. The code and the model weights are

approaches for the identification of pulmonary embolism in CTPA-Scans for
COVID-19 patients, provide an initial assessment of their performance and,
ultimately, provide a fast-track prototype solution (system). We adopted and
assessed some of the most popular convolutional neural network architectures
through transfer learning approaches, to strive to combine good model accuracy
with fast training. Additionally, we exploited one of the most popular
one-stage object detection models for the localization (through object
detection) of the pulmonary embolism regions-of-interests. The models of both
approaches are trained on an original CTPA-Scan dataset, where we annotated of
673 CTPA-Scan images with 1,465 bounding boxes in total, highlighting pulmonary
embolism regions-of-interests. We provide a brief assessment of some
state-of-the-art image classification models by achieving validation accuracies
of 91% in pulmonary embolism classification. Additionally, we achieved a
precision of about 68% on average in the object detection model for the
pulmonary embolism localization under 50% IoU threshold. For both approaches,
we provide the entire training pipelines for future studies (step by step
processes through source code). In this study, we present some of the most
accurate and fast deep learning models for pulmonary embolism identification in
CTPA-Scans images, through classification and localization (object detection)
approaches for patients infected by COVID-19. We provide a fast-track solution
(system) for the research community of the area, which combines both
classification and object detection models for improving the precision of
identifying pulmonary embolisms.</span>

                                        <span>Analysis engines based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vital for many
real-world problems that model relationships using large graphs. Challenges for
a GNN hardware platform include the ability to (a) host a variety of GNNs, (b)
handle high sparsity in input node feature vectors and the graph adjacency
matrix and the accompanying random memory access patterns, and (c) maintain
load-balanced computation in the face of uneven workloads induced by high
sparsity and power-law vertex degree distributions in real datasets. The
proposes GNNIE, an accelerator designed to run a broad range of GNNs. It
tackles workload imbalance by (i) splitting node feature operands into blocks,
(ii) reordering and redistributing computations, and (iii) using a flexible MAC
architecture with low communication overheads among the processing elements. In
addition, it adopts a graph partitioning scheme and a graph-specific caching
policy that efficiently uses off-chip memory bandwidth that is well suited to
the characteristics of real-world graphs. Random memory access effects are
mitigated by partitioning and degree-aware caching to enable the reuse of
high-degree vertices. GNNIE achieves average speedups of over 8890x over a CPU
and 295x over a GPU over multiple datasets on graph attention networks (GATs),
graph convolutional networks (GCNs), GraphSAGE, GINConv, and DiffPool, Compared
to prior approaches, GNNIE achieves an average speedup of 9.74x over HyGCN for
GCN, GraphSAGE, and GINConv; HyGCN cannot implement GATs. GNNIE achieves an
average speedup of 2.28x over AWB-GCN (which runs only GCNs), despite using
3.4x fewer processing units.</span>

differentially private machine learning algorithms. To improve this tradeoff,
prior work has looked at privacy amplification methods which analyze how common
training operations such as iteration and subsampling the data can lead to
higher privacy. In this paper, we analyze privacy amplification properties of a
new operation, sampling from the posterior, that is used in Bayesian inference.
In particular, we look at Bernoulli sampling from a posterior that is described
by a differentially private parameter. We provide an algorithm to compute the
amplification factor in this setting, and establish upper and lower bounds on
this factor. Finally, we look at what happens when we draw k posterior samples

differential privacy (LDP)} in cascading bandits. Under DP, we propose an
algorithm which guarantees $\epsilon$-indistinguishability and a regret of
$\mathcal{O}((\frac{\log T}{\epsilon})^{1+\xi})$ for an arbitrarily small
$\xi$. This is a significant improvement from the previous work of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log^3 T}{\epsilon})$ regret. Under
($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-LDP, we relax the $K^2$ dependence through the tradeoff
between privacy budget $\epsilon$ and error probability $\delta$, and obtain a
regret of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{K\log (1/\delta) \log T}{\epsilon^2})$, where $K$
is the size of the arm subset. This result holds for both Gaussian mechanism
and Laplace mechanism by analyses on the composition. Our results extend to
combinatorial semi-bandit. We show respective lower bounds for DP and LDP
cascading bandits. Extensive experiments corroborate our theoretic findings.</span>

(RL) methods are defined only on expectation of initial states, but allow each
certain state to be unsafe, which is unsatisfying for real-world
safety-critical tasks. In this paper, we introduce the feasible actor-critic
(FAC) algorithm, which is the first model-free constrained RL method that
considers statewise safety, e.g, safety for each initial state. We claim that
some states are inherently unsafe no matter what policy we choose, while for
other states there exist policies ensuring safety, where we say such states and
policies are feasible. By constructing a statewise Lagrange function available
on RL sampling and adopting an additional neural network to approximate the
statewise Lagrange multiplier, we manage to obtain the optimal feasible policy
which ensures safety for each feasible state and the safest possible policy for
infeasible states. Furthermore, the trained multiplier net can indicate whether
a given state is feasible or not through the statewise complementary slackness
condition. We provide theoretical guarantees that FAC outperforms previous
expectation-based constrained RL methods in terms of both constraint
satisfaction and reward optimization. Experimental results on both robot
locomotive tasks and safe exploration tasks verify the safety enhancement and
feasibility interpretation of the proposed method.</span>

reduce the computational cost. Still, it introduces an inherent sampling error,
making the selection of appropriate learning rates challenging. The sampling
errors can manifest either as a bias or variances in a line search. Dynamic
MBSS re-samples a mini-batch at every function evaluation. Hence, dynamic MBSS
results in point-wise discontinuous loss functions with smaller bias but larger
variance than static sampled loss functions. However, dynamic MBSS has the
advantage of having larger data throughput during training but requires the
complexity regarding discontinuities to be resolved. This study extends the
gradient-only surrogate (GOS), a line search method using quadratic
approximation models built with only directional derivative information, for
dynamic MBSS loss functions. We propose a gradient-only approximation line
search (GOALS) with strong convergence characteristics with defined optimality
criterion. We investigate GOALS&#x27;s performance by applying it on various
optimizers that include SGD, RMSprop and Adam on ResNet-18 and EfficientNetB0.
We also compare GOALS&#x27;s against the other existing learning rate methods. We
quantify both the best performing and most robust algorithms. For the latter,
we introduce a relative robust criterion that allows us to quantify the
difference between an algorithm and the best performing algorithm for a given
problem. The results show that training a model with the recommended learning
rate for a class of search directions helps to reduce the model errors in
multimodal cases.</span>

across people, and thus can be treated as an intrinsic property of an image.
Using computer vision models, we can make specific predictions about what
people will remember or forget. While older work has used now-outdated deep
learning architectures to predict image memorability, innovations in the field
have given us new techniques to apply to this problem. Here, we propose and
evaluate five alternative deep learning models which exploit developments in
the field from the last five years, largely the introduction of residual neural
networks, which are intended to allow the model to use semantic information in
the memorability estimation process. These new models were tested against the
prior state of the art with a combined dataset built to optimize both
within-category and across-category predictions. Our findings suggest that the
key prior memorability network had overstated its generalizability and was
overfit on its training set. Our new models outperform this prior model,
leading us to conclude that Residual Networks outperform simpler convolutional
neural networks in memorability regression. We make our new state-of-the-art
model readily available to the research community, allowing memory researchers
to make predictions about memorability on a wider range of images.</span>

                                        <span>Quantization is a technique used in deep neural networks (DNNs) to increase
execution performance and hardware efficiency. Uniform post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented
efficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a
training set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with
negligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with
PTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the
increase in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware
quantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation
sparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit
quantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of
8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value
bits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we
focus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal
to zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the
other&#x27;s 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically
quantized to 4 bits, as described. SPARQ achieves minor accuracy degradation,
2x speedup over widely used hardware architectures, and a practical hardware
implementation. The code is available at https://github.com/gilshm/sparq.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work has considered natural variations of the multi-armed bandit
problem, where the reward distribution of each arm is a special function of the
time passed since its last pulling. In this direction, a simple (yet widely
applicable) model is that of blocking bandits, where an arm becomes unavailable
for a deterministic number of rounds after each play. In this work, we extend
the above model in two directions: (i) We consider the general combinatorial
setting where more than one arms can be played at each round, subject to
feasibility constraints. (ii) We allow the blocking time of each arm to be
stochastic. We first study the computational/unconditional hardness of the
above setting and identify the necessary conditions for the problem to become
tractable (even in an approximate sense). Based on these conditions, we provide
a tight analysis of the approximation guarantee of a natural greedy heuristic
that always plays the maximum expected reward feasible subset among the
available (non-blocked) arms. When the arms&#x27; expected rewards are unknown, we
adapt the above heuristic into a bandit algorithm, based on UCB, for which we
provide sublinear (approximate) regret guarantees, matching the theoretical
lower bounds in the limiting case of absence of delays.</span>

is known to be one of the deadliest diseases which is hampering the lives of
many people around the world. Heart disease must be detected early so the loss
of lives can be prevented. The availability of large-scale data for medical
diagnosis has helped developed complex machine learning and deep learning-based
models for automated early diagnosis of heart diseases. The classical
approaches have been limited in terms of not generalizing well to new data
which have not been seen in the training set. This is indicated by a large gap
in training and test accuracies. This paper proposes a novel deep learning
architecture using a 1D convolutional neural network for classification between
healthy and non-healthy persons to overcome the limitations of classical
approaches. Various clinical parameters are used for assessing the risk profile
in the patients which helps in early diagnosis. Various techniques are used to
avoid overfitting in the proposed network. The proposed network achieves over
97% training accuracy and 96% test accuracy on the dataset. The accuracy of the
model is compared in detail with other classification algorithms using various
performance parameters which proves the effectiveness of the proposed
architecture.</span>

                                        <span>Training Deep neural networks (DNNs) on noisy labeled datasets is a
challenging problem, because learning on mislabeled examples deteriorates the
performance of the network. As the ground truth availability is limited with
real-world noisy datasets, previous papers created synthetic noisy datasets by
randomly modifying the labels of training examples of clean datasets. However,
no final conclusions can be derived by just using this random noise, since it
excludes feature-dependent noise. Thus, it is imperative to generate
feature-dependent noisy datasets that additionally provide ground truth.
Therefore, we propose an intuitive approach to creating feature-dependent noisy
datasets by utilizing the training predictions of DNNs on clean datasets that
also retain true label information. We refer to these datasets as &quot;Pseudo Noisy
datasets&quot;. We conduct several experiments to establish that Pseudo noisy
datasets resemble feature-dependent noisy datasets across different conditions.
We further randomly generate synthetic noisy datasets with the same noise
distribution as that of Pseudo noise (referred as &quot;Randomized Noise&quot;) to
empirically show that i) learning is easier with feature-dependent label noise
compared to random noise, ii) irrespective of noise distribution, Pseudo noisy
datasets mimic feature-dependent label noise and iii) current training methods
are not generalizable to feature-dependent label noise. Therefore, we believe
that Pseudo noisy datasets will be quite helpful to study and develop robust
training methods.</span>

users to share their user-generated content. This publicly-generated user data
is also crucial to healthcare technologies because the discovered patterns
would hugely benefit them in several ways. One of the applications is in
automatically discovering mental health problems, e.g., depression. Previous
studies to automatically detect a depressed user on online social media have
largely relied upon the user behaviour and their linguistic patterns including
user&#x27;s social interactions. The downside is that these models are trained on
several irrelevant content which might not be crucial towards detecting a
depressed user. Besides, these content have a negative impact on the overall
efficiency and effectiveness of the model. To overcome the shortcomings in the
existing automatic depression detection methods, we propose a novel
computational framework for automatic depression detection that initially
selects relevant content through a hybrid extractive and abstractive
summarization strategy on the sequence of all user tweets leading to a more
fine-grained and relevant content. The content then goes to our novel deep

revolutionized the predictive performance of various modern natural language
processing tasks. This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a
service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as commercial
APIs. However, previous works have discovered a series of vulnerabilities in
BERT- based APIs. For example, BERT-based APIs are vulnerable to both model
extraction attack and adversarial example transferrability attack. However, due
to the high capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be
overlearned, what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model
remains unknown and is lacking. To bridge this gap, in this work, we first
present an effective model extraction attack, where the adversary can
practically steal a BERT-based API (the target/victim model) by only querying a
limited number of queries. We further develop an effective attribute inference
attack to expose the sensitive attribute of the training data used by the
BERT-based APIs. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various

have motivated research into a multitude of attack detection mechanisms,
including anomaly detectors based on neural network models. The effectiveness
of anomaly detectors can be assessed by subjecting them to test suites of
attacks, but less consideration has been given to adversarial attackers that
craft noise specifically designed to deceive them. While successfully applied
in domains such as images and audio, adversarial attacks are much harder to
implement in CPSs due to the presence of other built-in defence mechanisms such
as rule checkers(or invariant checkers). In this work, we present an
adversarial attack that simultaneously evades the anomaly detectors and rule
checkers of a CPS. Inspired by existing gradient-based approaches, our
adversarial attack crafts noise over the sensor and actuator values, then uses
a genetic algorithm to optimise the latter, ensuring that the neural network
and the rule checking system are both deceived.We implemented our approach for
two real-world critical infrastructure testbeds, successfully reducing the
classification accuracy of their detectors by over 50% on average, while
simultaneously avoiding detection by rule checkers. Finally, we explore whether
these attacks can be mitigated by training the detectors on adversarial
samples.</span>

analysis of dynamic interactive pattern are necessary for autonomous vehicles
to make appropriate decisions. This study proposes an unsupervised learning
framework that combines primitive-based interactive pattern recognition methods
and risk analysis methods. The Hidden Markov Model with the Gaussian mixture
model (GMM-HMM) approach is developed to decompose the LC scenarios into
primitives. Then the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance based K-means
clustering is applied to gather the primitives to 13 types of interactive
patterns. Finally, this study considers two types of time-to-collision (TTC)
involved in the LC process as indicators to analyze the risk of the interactive
patterns and extract high-risk LC interactive patterns. The results obtained
from The Highway Drone Dataset (highD) demonstrate that the identified LC
interactive patterns contain interpretable semantic information. This study

exploration of the space of decisions. However, \textit{simultaneously}
proposing a batch of decisions, which leverages available resources for
parallel experimentation, has the potential to rapidly accelerate exploration.
We present a family of (parallel) contextual linear bandit algorithms, whose
regret is nearly identical to their perfectly sequential counterparts -- given
access to the same total number of oracle queries -- up to a lower-order
&quot;burn-in&quot; term that is dependent on the context-set geometry. We provide
matching information-theoretic lower bounds on parallel regret performance to
establish our algorithms are asymptotically optimal in the time horizon.
Finally, we also present an empirical evaluation of these parallel algorithms
in several domains, including materials discovery and biological sequence
design problems, to demonstrate the utility of parallelized bandits in

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective technique for training
decision-making agents through interactions with their environment. The advent
of deep learning has been associated with highly notable successes with
sequential decision making problems - such as defeating some of the
highest-ranked human players at Go. In digital advertising, real-time bidding
(RTB) is a common method of allocating advertising inventory through real-time
auctions. Bidding strategies need to incorporate logic for dynamically
adjusting parameters in order to deliver pre-assigned campaign goals. Here we
discuss techniques toward using RL to train bidding agents. As a campaign
metric we particularly focused on viewability: the percentage of inventory
which goes on to be viewed by an end user.

This paper is presented as a survey of techniques and experiments which we
developed through the course of this research. We discuss expanding our
training data to include edge cases by training on simulated interactions. We
discuss the experimental results comparing the performance of several promising
RL algorithms, and an approach to hyperparameter optimization of an
actor/critic training pipeline through Bayesian optimization. Finally, we
present live-traffic tests of some of our RL agents against a rule-based
feedback-control approach, demonstrating the potential for this method as well
as areas for further improvement. This paper therefore presents an arrangement
of our findings in this quickly developing field, and ways that it can be
applied to an RTB use case.</span>

                                        <span>Learning Granger causality among event types on multi-type event sequences is
an important but challenging task. Existing methods, such as the Multivariate
Hawkes processes, mostly assumed that each sequence is independent and
identically distributed. However, in many real-world applications, it is
commonplace to encounter a topological network behind the event sequences such
that an event is excited or inhibited not only by its history but also by its
topological neighbors. Consequently, the failure in describing the topological
dependency among the event sequences leads to the error detection of the causal
structure. By considering the Hawkes processes from the view of temporal
convolution, we propose a Topological Hawkes processes (THP) to draw a
connection between the graph convolution in topology domain and the temporal
convolution in time domains. We further propose a Granger causality learning
method on THP in a likelihood framework. The proposed method is featured with
the graph convolution-based likelihood function of THP and a sparse
optimization scheme with an Expectation-Maximization of the likelihood
function. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both synthetic and real-world
data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>Graph embedding is essential for graph mining tasks. With the prevalence of
graph data in real-world applications, many methods have been proposed in
recent years to learn high-quality graph embedding vectors various types of
graphs. However, most existing methods usually randomly select the negative
samples from the original graph to enhance the training data without
considering the noise. In addition, most of these methods only focus on the
explicit graph structures and cannot fully capture complex semantics of edges
such as various relationships or asymmetry. In order to address these issues,
we propose a robust and generalized framework for adversarial graph embedding
based on generative adversarial networks. Inspired by generative adversarial
network, we propose a robust and generalized framework for adversarial graph
embedding, named AGE. AGE generates the fake neighbor nodes as the enhanced
negative samples from the implicit distribution, and enables the discriminator
and generator to jointly learn each node&#x27;s robust and generalized
representation. Based on this framework, we propose three models to handle
three types of graph data and derive the corresponding optimization algorithms,
i.e., UG-AGE and DG-AGE for undirected and directed homogeneous graphs,
respectively, and HIN-AGE for heterogeneous information networks. Extensive
experiments show that our methods consistently and significantly outperform
existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple graph mining tasks, including
link prediction, node classification, and graph reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>Noisy neural networks (NoisyNNs) refer to the inference and training of NNs
in the presence of noise. Noise is inherent in most communication and storage
systems; hence, NoisyNNs emerge in many new applications, including federated
edge learning, where wireless devices collaboratively train a NN over a noisy
wireless channel, or when NNs are implemented/stored in an analog storage
medium. This paper studies a fundamental problem of NoisyNNs: how to estimate
the uncontaminated NN weights from their noisy observations or manifestations.
Whereas all prior works relied on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to
maximize the likelihood function of the estimated NN weights, this paper
demonstrates that the ML estimator is in general suboptimal. To overcome the
suboptimality of the conventional ML estimator, we put forth an
$\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator to minimize a compensated mean squared error (MSE)
with a population compensator and a bias compensator. Our approach works well
for NoisyNNs arising in both 1) noisy inference, where noise is introduced only
in the inference phase on the already-trained NN weights; and 2) noisy
training, where noise is introduced over the course of training. Extensive
experiments on the CIFAR-10 and SST-2 datasets with different NN architectures
verify the significant performance gains of the $\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator
over the ML estimator when used to denoise the NoisyNN. For noisy inference,
the average gains are up to $156\%$ for a noisy ResNet34 model and $14.7\%$ for
a noisy BERT model; for noisy training, the average gains are up to $18.1$ dB
for a noisy ResNet18 model.</span>

                                        <span>The drug discovery and development process is a long and expensive one,
costing over 1 billion USD on average per drug and taking 10-15 years. To
reduce the high levels of attrition throughout the process, there has been a
growing interest in applying machine learning methodologies to various stages
of drug discovery process in the recent decade, including at the earliest stage
- identification of druggable disease genes. In this paper, we have developed a
new tensor factorisation model to predict potential drug targets (i.e.,genes or
proteins) for diseases. We created a three dimensional tensor which consists of
1,048 targets, 860 diseases and 230,011 evidence attributes and clinical
outcomes connecting them, using data extracted from the Open Targets and
PharmaProjects databases. We enriched the data with gene representations
learned from a drug discovery-oriented knowledge graph and applied our proposed
method to predict the clinical outcomes for unseen target and dis-ease pairs.
We designed three evaluation strategies to measure the prediction performance
and benchmarked several commonly used machine learning classifiers together
with matrix and tensor factorisation methods. The result shows that
incorporating knowledge graph embeddings significantly improves the prediction
accuracy and that training tensor factorisation alongside a dense neural
network outperforms other methods. In summary, our framework combines two
actively studied machine learning approaches to disease target identification,
tensor factorisation and knowledge graph representation learning, which could
be a promising avenue for further exploration in data-driven drug discovery.</span>

                                        <span>The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is the wide-network limit of a kernel defined
using neural networks at initialization, whose embedding is the gradient of the
output of the network with respect to its parameters. We study the &quot;after
kernel&quot;, which is defined using the same embedding, except after training, for
neural networks with standard architectures, on binary classification problems
extracted from MNIST and CIFAR-10, trained using SGD in a standard way. Lyu and
Li described a sense in which neural networks, under certain conditions, are
equivalent to SVM with the after kernel. Our experiments are consistent with
this proposition under natural conditions. For networks with an architecure
similar to VGG, the after kernel is more &quot;global&quot;, in the sense that it is less
invariant to transformations of input images that disrupt the global structure
of the image while leaving the local statistics largely intact. For fully
connected networks, the after kernel is less global in this sense. The after
kernel tends to be more invariant to small shifts, rotations and zooms; data
augmentation does not improve these invariances. The (finite approximation to
the) conjugate kernel, obtained using the last layer of hidden nodes,
sometimes, but not always, provides a good approximation to the NTK and the
after kernel.</span>

                                        <span>With the explosive growth of video data, video summarization, which attempts
to seek the minimum subset of frames while still conveying the main story, has
become one of the hottest topics. Nowadays, substantial achievements have been
made by supervised learning techniques, especially after the emergence of deep
learning. However, it is extremely expensive and difficult to collect human
annotation for large-scale video datasets. To address this problem, we propose
a convolutional attentive adversarial network (CAAN), whose key idea is to
build a deep summarizer in an unsupervised way. Upon the generative adversarial
network, our overall framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The
former predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter
tries to distinguish the score-weighted frame features from original frame
features. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence
network to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based
network to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our
objective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the
frame-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this
proposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public
benchmarks SumMe and TVSum. The results show the superiority of our proposed
method against other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. Our method even
outperforms some published supervised approaches.</span>

use and applications of VR technology for gaming purposes have become more
pervasive than ever. Despite the growing popularity of VR gaming, user studies
into how it might affect the player experience (PX) during the gameplay are
scarce. Accordingly, the current study investigated the effects of VR gaming
and game genre on PX. We compared PX metrics for two game genres, strategy
(more interactive) and racing (less interactive), across two gaming platforms,
VR and traditional desktop gaming. Participants were randomly assigned to one
of the gaming platforms, played both a strategy and racing game on their
corresponding platform, and provided PX ratings. Results revealed that,
regardless of the game genre, participants in the VR gaming condition
experienced a greater level of sense of presence than did those in the desktop
gaming condition. That said, results showed that the two gaming platforms did
not significantly differ from one another in PX ratings. As for the effect of
game genre, participants provided greater PX ratings for the strategy game than
for the racing game, regardless of whether the game was played on a VR headset
or desktop computer. Collectively, these results indicate that although VR
gaming affords a greater sense of presence in the game environment, this
increase in presence does not seem to translate into a more satisfactory PX
when playing either a strategy or racing game.</span>

increased attention to copyright. Image watermarking has been considered one of
the most popular methods for copyright protection. With the recent advancements
in applying deep neural networks in image processing, these networks have also
been used in image watermarking. Robustness and imperceptibility are two
challenging features of watermarking methods that the trade-off between them
should be satisfied. In this paper, we propose to use an end-to-end network for
watermarking. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to control the
embedding strength based on the image content. Dynamic embedding helps the
network to have the lowest effect on the visual quality of the watermarked
image. Different image processing attacks are simulated as a network layer to
improve the robustness of the model. Our method is a blind watermarking
approach that replicates the watermark string to create a matrix of the same
size as the input image. Instead of diffusing the watermark data into the input
image, we inject the data into the feature space and force the network to do
this in regions that increase the robustness against various attacks.
Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of
imperceptibility and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.</span>

many processes take place in parallel, compete on resources and influence each
other&#x27;s behavior. The scalable modeling of biological systems continues to be a
very active field of research. In this paper we introduce a new approach based
on Event-B, a state-based formal method with refinement as its central
ingredient, allowing us to check for model consistency step-by-step in an
automated way. Our approach based on functions leads to an elegant and concise
modeling method. We demonstrate this approach by constructing what is, to our
knowledge, the largest ever built Event-B model, describing the ErbB signaling
pathway, a key evolutionary pathway with a significant role in development and
in many types of cancer. The Event-B model for the ErbB pathway describes 1320
molecular reactions through 242 events.</span>

effects of linguistic properties. For example, does writing a complaint
politely lead to a faster response time? How much will a positive product
review increase sales? This paper addresses two technical challenges related to
the problem before developing a practical method. First, we formalize the
causal quantity of interest as the effect of a writer&#x27;s intent, and establish
the assumptions necessary to identify this from observational data. Second, in
practice, we only have access to noisy proxies for the linguistic properties of
interest -- e.g., predictions from classifiers and lexicons. We propose an
estimator for this setting and prove that its bias is bounded when we perform
an adjustment for the text. Based on these results, we introduce TextCause, an
algorithm for estimating causal effects of linguistic properties. The method
leverages (1) distant supervision to improve the quality of noisy proxies, and
(2) a pre-trained language model (BERT) to adjust for the text. We show that
the proposed method outperforms related approaches when estimating the effect
of Amazon review sentiment on semi-simulated sales figures. Finally, we present
an applied case study investigating the effects of complaint politeness on
bureaucratic response times.</span>

                                        <span>Contemporary approaches to perception, planning, estimation, and control have
allowed robots to operate robustly as our remote surrogates in uncertain,
unstructured environments. There is now an opportunity for robots to operate
not only in isolation, but also with and alongside humans in our complex
environments. Natural language provides an efficient and flexible medium
through which humans can communicate with collaborative robots. Through
significant progress in statistical methods for natural language understanding,
robots are now able to interpret a diverse array of free-form navigation,
manipulation, and mobile manipulation commands. However, most contemporary
approaches require a detailed prior spatial-semantic map of the robot&#x27;s
environment that models the space of possible referents of the utterance.
Consequently, these methods fail when robots are deployed in new, previously
unknown, or partially observed environments, particularly when mental models of
the environment differ between the human operator and the robot. This paper
provides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows
field and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural language
instructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our
approach is its use of language as a &quot;sensor&quot; -- inferring spatial,
topological, and semantic information implicit in natural language utterances
and then exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent
environment model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic language
grounding model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the
robot&#x27;s action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief space
policy that reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We
evaluate our framework through a variety of different navigation and mobile
manipulation experiments.</span>

novel unsupervised method to derive multilingual sentence embeddings relying
only on monolingual data. We first produce a synthetic parallel corpus using
unsupervised machine translation, and use it to fine-tune a pretrained
cross-lingual masked language model (XLM) to derive the multilingual sentence
representations. The quality of the representations is evaluated on two
parallel corpus mining tasks with improvements of up to 22 F1 points over
vanilla XLM. In addition, we observe that a single synthetic bilingual corpus
is able to improve results for other language pairs.</span>

                                        <span>In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit
converts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language
realization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large
datasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated
with application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from
custom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the
training set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of
the recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future
bridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical
step is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the
present context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over
annotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the
system. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in
classical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate
a prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a
universal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.</span>

                                        <span>The problem of knowledge-based visual question answering involves answering
questions that require external knowledge in addition to the content of the
image. Such knowledge typically comes in a variety of forms, including visual,
textual, and commonsense knowledge. The use of more knowledge sources, however,
also increases the chance of retrieving more irrelevant or noisy facts, making
it difficult to comprehend the facts and find the answer. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-modal Answer Validation using External knowledge
(MAVEx), where the idea is to validate a set of promising answer candidates
based on answer-specific knowledge retrieval. This is in contrast to existing
approaches that search for the answer in a vast collection of often irrelevant
facts. Our approach aims to learn which knowledge source should be trusted for
each answer candidate and how to validate the candidate using that source. We
consider a multi-modal setting, relying on both textual and visual knowledge
resources, including images searched using Google, sentences from Wikipedia
articles, and concepts from ConceptNet. Our experiments with OK-VQA, a
challenging knowledge-based VQA dataset, demonstrate that MAVEx achieves new
state-of-the-art results.</span>

Representation (AMR) to help dialogue modeling. Compared with the textual

sparsity. We develop an algorithm to construct dialogue-level AMR graphs from
sentence-level AMRs and explore two ways to incorporate AMRs into dialogue

~391X speedup compared to CPU vector search and ~5.4X speedup compared to
vector search with GPU acceleration. Experiments show that this speed advantage
even gets bigger for larger datasets because VisualSparta can be efficiently
implemented as an inverted index. To the best of our knowledge, VisualSparta is
the first transformer-based text-to-image retrieval model that can achieve
real-time searching for large-scale datasets, with significant accuracy
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language
processing (NLP) systems. Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are
typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various
downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the
highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled
data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is
abundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for
Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep
metric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for
learning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training
data. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,
our approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised
pretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments
suggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number
of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data, making
further improvements straightforward. Our code and pretrained models are
publicly available and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed
unseen text.</span>

irrelevant or unsolicited information - commonly called &quot;spammers&quot; - distort
the network structure of social networks. Two large social networks are
analyzed, the first extracted from the Twitter discourse about a big
telecommunication company, and the second obtained from three years of email
communication of 200 managers working for a large multinational company. This
work compares network robustness and the stability of centrality and
interaction metrics, as well as the use of language, after removing spammers
and the most and least connected nodes. The results show that spammers do not
significantly alter the structure of the information-carrying network, for most
of the social indicators. The authors additionally investigate the correlation
between e-mail subject line and content by tracking language sentiment,
emotionality, and complexity, addressing the cases where collecting email
bodies is not permitted for privacy reasons. The findings extend the research
about robustness and stability of social networks metrics, after the
application of graph simplification strategies. The results have practical
implication for network analysts and for those company managers who rely on
network analytics (applied to company emails and social media data) to support
their decision-making processes.</span>

                                        <span>Distantly supervision automatically generates plenty of training samples for
relation extraction. However, it also incurs two major problems: noisy labels
and imbalanced training data. Previous works focus more on reducing wrongly
labeled relations (false positives) while few explore the missing relations
that are caused by incompleteness of knowledge base (false negatives).
Furthermore, the quantity of negative labels overwhelmingly surpasses the
positive ones in previous problem formulations. In this paper, we first provide
a thorough analysis of the above challenges caused by negative data. Next, we
formulate the problem of relation extraction into as a positive unlabeled
learning task to alleviate false negative problem. Thirdly, we propose a
pipeline approach, dubbed \textsc{ReRe}, that performs sentence-level relation
detection then subject/object extraction to achieve sample-efficient training.
Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing approaches and remains excellent performance even learned with a large
quantity of false positive samples.</span>

                                        <span>Data augmentation has recently seen increased interest in NLP due to more
work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale
neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this
recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the
challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by
summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and
motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically
representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for
popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges
and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the
landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate
additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper

speaker preferences. Existing personalized conversation tasks typically require
models to extract speaker preferences from user descriptions or their
conversation histories, which are scarce for newcomers and inactive users. In
this paper, we propose a few-shot personalized conversation task with an
auxiliary social network. The task requires models to generate personalized
responses for a speaker given a few conversations from the speaker and a social
network. Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or
conversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few
conversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers
with few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that
learns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from
resource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we
propose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers&#x27; information from the
social network. The TA provides prior knowledge of the new speaker in its
meta-learning. Experimental results show our methods outperform all baselines
in appropriateness, diversity, and consistency with speakers.</span>

                                        <span>Persona can function as the prior knowledge for maintaining the consistency
of dialogue systems. Most of previous studies adopted the self persona in
dialogue whose response was about to be selected from a set of candidates or
directly generated, but few have noticed the role of partner in dialogue. This
paper makes an attempt to thoroughly explore the impact of utilizing personas
that describe either self or partner speakers on the task of response selection
in retrieval-based chatbots. Four persona fusion strategies are designed, which
assume personas interact with contexts or responses in different ways. These
strategies are implemented into three representative models for response
selection, which are based on the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder (HRE),
Interactive Matching Network (IMN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT) respectively. Empirical studies on the Persona-Chat
dataset show that the partner personas neglected in previous studies can
improve the accuracy of response selection in the IMN- and BERT-based models.
Besides, our BERT-based model implemented with the context-response-aware
persona fusion strategy outperforms previous methods by margins larger than
2.7% on original personas and 4.6% on revised personas in terms of hits@1
(top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the
Persona-Chat dataset.</span>

or understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to
generate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and
developer-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure
consisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and
supervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit
tests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code
pretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal
method. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with
pretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing
additional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest
publicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and
corresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from
91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five
defects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the
focal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test
coverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite
and GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable
coverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their
preference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing
effectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards
AthenaTest.</span>

                                        <span>Logical reasoning, which is closely related to human cognition, is of vital
importance in human&#x27;s understanding of texts. Recent years have witnessed
increasing attentions on machine&#x27;s logical reasoning abilities. However,
previous studies commonly apply ad-hoc methods to model pre-defined relation
patterns, such as linking named entities, which only considers global knowledge
components that are related to commonsense, without local perception of
complete facts or events. Such methodology is obviously insufficient to deal
with complicated logical structures. Therefore, we argue that the natural logic
units would be the group of backbone constituents of the sentence such as the
subject-verb-object formed &quot;facts&quot;, covering both global and local knowledge
pieces that are necessary as the basis for logical reasoning. Beyond building
the ad-hoc graphs, we propose a more general and convenient fact-driven
approach to construct a supergraph on top of our newly defined fact units, and
enhance the supergraph with further explicit guidance of local question and
option interactions. Experiments on two challenging logical reasoning benchmark
datasets, ReClor and LogiQA, show that our proposed model, \textsc{Focal
Reasoner}, outperforms the baseline models dramatically. It can also be
smoothly applied to other downstream tasks such as MuTual, a dialogue reasoning
dataset, achieving competitive results.</span>

                                        <span>Context-aware machine translation models are designed to leverage contextual
information, but often fail to do so. As a result, they inaccurately
disambiguate pronouns and polysemous words that require context for resolution.
In this paper, we ask several questions: What contexts do human translators use
to resolve ambiguous words? Are models paying large amounts of attention to the
same context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these
questions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a
new English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K
translations that professional translators found useful for pronoun
disambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used
to disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the
supporting words. Furthermore, we measure the degree of alignment between the
model&#x27;s attention scores and the supporting context from SCAT, and apply a
guided attention strategy to encourage agreement between the two.</span>

can accept either video or text input, or both for a variety of end tasks.
Existing pre-training are task-specific by adopting either a single cross-modal
encoder that requires both modalities, limiting their use for retrieval-style
end tasks or more complex multitask learning with two unimodal encoders,
limiting early cross-modal fusion. We instead introduce new pretraining masking
schemes that better mix across modalities (e.g. by forcing masks for text to
predict the closest video embeddings) while also maintaining separability (e.g.
unimodal predictions are sometimes required, without using all the input).
Experimental results show strong performance across a wider range of tasks than
any previous methods, often outperforming task-specific pre-training.</span>

reinforcement learning and auto-encoders. However, no mechanism ensures that

                                        <span>Story visualization is an under-explored task that falls at the intersection
of many important research directions in both computer vision and natural
language processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions
which compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that
correspond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative
models which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,
there is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,
coherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling
approaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that
utilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story
and generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for
sequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to
model complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to
demonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of
the model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.
Furthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard
evaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also
provide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects
of the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,
the relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images. We also
present correlation experiments of our proposed automated metrics with human
evaluations. Code and data available at:

                                        <span>Probes are models devised to investigate the encoding of knowledge -- e.g.
syntactic structure -- in contextual representations. Probes are often designed
for simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not
allow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one
such restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe
(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic
structure in contextual representations through learning only linear
transformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are
able to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical
number of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis
function (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a
statistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --
implying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.
We conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT&#x27;s self-attention
layers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe&#x27;s
stronger performance.</span>

protection in many countries. Currently, twelve countries adopt the regulation
and establish their GDPR-like regulation. However, to evaluate the differences
and similarities of these GDPR-like regulations is time-consuming and needs a
lot of manual effort from legal experts. Moreover, GDPR-like regulations from
different countries are written in their languages leading to a more difficult
task since legal experts who know both languages are essential. In this paper,
we investigate a simple natural language processing (NLP) approach to tackle
the problem. We first extract chunks of information from GDPR-like documents
and form structured data from natural language. Next, we use NLP methods to
compare documents to measure their similarity. Finally, we manually label a
small set of data to evaluate our approach. The empirical result shows that the
BERT model with cosine similarity outperforms other baselines. Our data and

                                        <span>End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted
increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that
combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the
new approach extracts users&#x27; intentions directly from the speech signals,
resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is
typically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to
take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a
dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework
that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The
backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an
intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and
multiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on
the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is
about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the
performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an
online and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task
using the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly
promising.</span>

We approximate Bayesian summary generation by first extending state-of-the-art

multiple stochastic forward passes. This method allows us to improve
summarization performance by simply using the median of multiple stochastic
summaries. We show that our variational equivalents of BART and PEGASUS can
outperform their deterministic counterparts on multiple benchmark datasets. In
addition, we rely on Bayesian inference to measure the uncertainty of the model
when generating summaries. Having a reliable uncertainty measure, we can
improve the experience of the end user by filtering out generated summaries of
high uncertainty. Furthermore, our proposed metric could be used as a criterion
for selecting samples for annotation, and can be paired nicely with active
learning and human-in-the-loop approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Span-based joint extraction simultaneously conducts named entity recognition
(NER) and relation extraction (RE) in text span form. Recent studies have shown
that token labels can convey crucial task-specific information and enrich token
semantics. However, as far as we know, due to completely abstain from sequence
tagging mechanism, all prior span-based work fails to use token label
in-formation. To solve this problem, we pro-pose Sequence Tagging enhanced
Span-based Network (STSN), a span-based joint extrac-tion network that is
enhanced by token BIO label information derived from sequence tag-ging based
NER. By stacking multiple atten-tion layers in depth, we design a deep neu-ral
architecture to build STSN, and each atten-tion layer consists of three basic
attention units. The deep neural architecture first learns seman-tic
representations for token labels and span-based joint extraction, and then
constructs in-formation interactions between them, which also realizes
bidirectional information interac-tions between span-based NER and RE.
Fur-thermore, we extend the BIO tagging scheme to make STSN can extract
overlapping en-tity. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our
model consistently outperforms previous optimal models by a large margin,
creating new state-of-the-art results.</span>

                                        <span>Sarcasm detection and humor classification are inherently subtle problems,
primarily due to their dependence on the contextual and non-verbal information.
Furthermore, existing studies in these two topics are usually constrained in
non-English languages such as Hindi, due to the unavailability of qualitative
annotated datasets. In this work, we make two major contributions considering
the above limitations: (1) we develop a Hindi-English code-mixed dataset,
MaSaC, for the multi-modal sarcasm detection and humor classification in
conversational dialog, which to our knowledge is the first dataset of its kind;
(2) we propose MSH-COMICS, a novel attention-rich neural architecture for the
utterance classification. We learn efficient utterance representation utilizing
a hierarchical attention mechanism that attends to a small portion of the input
sentence at a time. Further, we incorporate dialog-level contextual attention
mechanism to leverage the dialog history for the multi-modal classification. We
perform extensive experiments for both the tasks by varying multi-modal inputs
and various submodules of MSH-COMICS. We also conduct comparative analysis
against existing approaches. We observe that MSH-COMICS attains superior
performance over the existing models by &gt; 1 F1-score point for the sarcasm
detection and 10 F1-score points in humor classification. We diagnose our model
and perform thorough analysis of the results to understand the superiority and
pitfalls.</span>

answers from a sentence, using its Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).
Previous work has made a case for using question-answer pairs to specify
predicate-argument structure of a sentence using natural language, which does
not require linguistic expertise or training. This has resulted in the creation
of datasets such as QA-SRL and QAMR, for both of which, the question-answer
pair annotations were crowdsourced. Our approach has the same end-goal, but is
automatic, making it faster and cost-effective, without compromising on the
quality and validity of the question-answer pairs thus obtained. A qualitative
evaluation of the output generated by ASQ from the AMR 2.0 data shows that the
question-answer pairs are natural and valid, and demonstrate good coverage of
the content. We run ASQ on the sentences from the QAMR dataset, to observe that
the semantic roles in QAMR are also captured by ASQ.We intend to make this tool
and the results publicly available for others to use and build upon.</span>

                                        <span>Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI
in recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction
from undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large
datasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a
matching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this
limitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on
fully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image
prior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during
inference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional
architectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and
randomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these
limitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method
based on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a
deep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise
and latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a
high-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot
reconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is
performed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to
ensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on
brain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER
against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.</span>

                                        <span>The way features propagate in Fully Convolutional Networks is of momentous
importance to capture multi-scale contexts for obtaining precise segmentation
masks. This paper proposes a novel series-parallel hybrid paradigm called the
Chained Context Aggregation Module (CAM) to diversify feature propagation. CAM
gains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style
information flows and fuses them in a two-stage process, namely pre-fusion and
re-fusion. The serial flow continuously increases receptive fields of output
neurons and those in parallel encode different region-based contexts. Each
information flow is a shallow encoder-decoder with appropriate down-sampling
scales to sufficiently capture contextual information. We further adopt an
attention model in CAM to guide feature re-fusion. Based on these developments,
we construct the Chained Context Aggregation Network (CANet), which employs an
asymmetric decoder to recover precise spatial details of prediction maps. We
conduct extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, including Pascal VOC
2012, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, CamVid, SUN-RGBD and GATECH. Results evidence
that CANet achieves state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>High quality perception is essential for autonomous driving (AD) systems. To
reach the accuracy and robustness that are required by such systems, several
types of sensors must be combined. Currently, mostly cameras and laser scanners
(lidar) are deployed to build a representation of the world around the vehicle.
While radar sensors have been used for a long time in the automotive industry,
they are still under-used for AD despite their appealing characteristics
(notably, their ability to measure the relative speed of obstacles and to
operate even in adverse weather conditions). To a large extent, this situation
is due to the relative lack of automotive datasets with real radar signals that
are both raw and annotated. In this work, we introduce CARRADA, a dataset of
synchronized camera and radar recordings with range-angle-Doppler annotations.
We also present a semi-automatic annotation approach, which was used to
annotate the dataset, and a radar semantic segmentation baseline, which we
evaluate on several metrics. Both our code and dataset are available online.</span>

proposed for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) to explicitly reduce high
inter-subject variations caused by identity-related facial attributes, e.g.,
age, race, and gender. As part of an end-to-end system, a cGAN was designed to
transform a given input facial expression image to an &quot;average&quot; identity face
with the same expression as the input. Then, identity-free FER is possible
since the generated images have the same synthetic &quot;average&quot; identity and
differ only in their displayed expressions. Experiments on four facial
expression datasets, one with spontaneous expressions, show that IF-GAN
outperforms the baseline CNN and achieves state-of-the-art performance for FER.</span>

applications. For example, building footprints are useful for high fidelity
population estimates, and quantifying population statistics is fundamental to
~1/4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators. In this
paper we (the SpaceNet Partners) discuss efforts to develop techniques for
precise building footprint localization, tracking, and change detection via the
SpaceNet Multi-Temporal Urban Development Challenge (also known as SpaceNet 7).
In this NeurIPS 2020 competition, participants were asked identify and track
buildings in satellite imagery time series collected over rapidly urbanizing
areas. The competition centered around a brand new open source dataset of
Planet Labs satellite imagery mosaics at 4m resolution, which includes 24
images (one per month) covering ~100 unique geographies. Tracking individual
buildings at this resolution is quite challenging, yet the winning participants
demonstrated impressive performance with the newly developed SpaceNet Change

retrieval, i.e., retrieving relevant images from a large and unlabelled dataset
given textual queries. In this paper, we propose VisualSparta, a novel

improvement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. VisualSparta is capable
of outperforming previous state-of-the-art scalable methods in MSCOCO and

advantages, i.e., for a 1 million image index, VisualSparta using CPU gets
~391X speedup compared to CPU vector search and ~5.4X speedup compared to
vector search with GPU acceleration. Experiments show that this speed advantage
even gets bigger for larger datasets because VisualSparta can be efficiently
implemented as an inverted index. To the best of our knowledge, VisualSparta is
the first transformer-based text-to-image retrieval model that can achieve
real-time searching for large-scale datasets, with significant accuracy
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

benchmarking study on these different choices, with two key experiments
evaluated on a real-world object pose estimation task. First, we study the

superior to a large number of low-quality images. Second, we study the type of
randomisation, and find that both distractors and textures are important for
generalisation to novel environments.</span>

images captured in low-light conditions in the wild. Classical image-denoising
filters work well in the frequency space but are constrained by several factors
such as the correct choice of thresholds, frequency estimates etc. On the other
hand, traditional deep networks are trained end-to-end in the RGB space by
formulating this task as an image-translation problem. However, that is done
without any explicit constraints on the inherent noise of the dark images and
thus produce noisy and blurry outputs. To this end we propose a DCT/FFT based
multi-scale loss function, which when combined with traditional losses, trains
a network to translate the important features for visually pleasing output. Our
loss function is end-to-end differentiable, scale-agnostic, and generic; i.e.,
it can be applied to both RAW and JPEG images in most existing frameworks
without additional overhead. Using this loss function, we report significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art using quantitative metrics and
subjective tests.</span>

                                        <span>The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for
prostate cancer. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices,
the use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has
increased. However, to the best of the authors&#x27; knowledge, the development of
algorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to
Gleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of
the work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system
able to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. The
methodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on
convolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous
patterns. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design
architecture. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of
filters of the last convolutional layer in the network. From the reconstructed
prediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue
to feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.mIn our
SICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a
Cohen&#x27;s quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason
grading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results
outperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model
reaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a
patient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection
task, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason
scoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen&#x27;s Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset.
Shallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current
state-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification.</span>

surrogate Computer Aided Design (CAD) models are able to detect and classify
real-world artefacts from photographs. The applications of which support
twinning of digital and physical assets in design, including rapid extraction
of part geometry from model repositories, information search \&amp; retrieval and
identifying components in the field for maintenance, repair, and recording. The
performance of CNNs in classification tasks have been shown dependent on
training data set size and number of classes. Where prior works have used
relatively small surrogate model data sets ($&lt;100$ models), the question
remains as to the ability of a CNN to differentiate between models in
increasingly large model repositories. This paper presents a method for
generating synthetic image data sets from online CAD model repositories, and
further investigates the capacity of an off-the-shelf CNN architecture trained
on synthetic data to classify models as class size increases. 1,000 CAD models
were curated and processed to generate large scale surrogate data sets,
featuring model coverage at steps of 10$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$,
and 120$^{\circ}$ degrees. The findings demonstrate the capability of computer
vision algorithms to classify artefacts in model repositories of up to 200,
beyond this point the CNN&#x27;s performance is observed to deteriorate
significantly, limiting its present ability for automated twinning of physical
to digital artefacts. Although, a match is more often found in the top-5
results showing potential for information search and retrieval on large
repositories of surrogate models.</span>

                                        <span>Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The gold
standard for diagnosis and prognosis is the Gleason grading system. In this
process, pathologists manually analyze prostate histology slides under
microscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last years,
computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that
could support pathologists in the daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, these
systems are usually trained using tedious and prone-to-error pixel-level
annotations of Gleason grades in the tissue. To alleviate the need of manual
pixel-wise labeling, just a handful of works have been presented in the
literature. Motivated by this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised
deep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the
global Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to
accurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level
scoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform
extensive experiments on three different external datasets for the patch-level
Gleason grading, and on two different test sets for global Grade Group
prediction. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms its
supervised counterpart on patch-level Gleason grading by a large margin, as
well as state-of-the-art methods on global biopsy-level scoring. Particularly,
the proposed model brings an average improvement on the Cohen&#x27;s quadratic kappa
(k) score of nearly 18% compared to full-supervision for the patch-level
Gleason grading task.</span>

                                        <span>Learning maps between data samples is fundamental. Applications range from
representation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the
estimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map
between feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be
imposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces
regularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image
registrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs
of samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent
deep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers
altogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is
possible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only
and elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep
networks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid
interpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial
transformations. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our experiments
present compelling evidence, on both synthetic and real data, that regular maps
can be obtained without carefully tuned explicit regularizers, while achieving
competitive registration performance.</span>

framework to explore optically compute the CNNs in free-space, much like a

which are limited to processing single-channel (i.e., grayscale) inputs, we
propose the first general approach, based on nanoscale meta-surface optics,
that can process RGB data directly from the natural scenes. Our system achieves

questions that require external knowledge in addition to the content of the
image. Such knowledge typically comes in a variety of forms, including visual,
textual, and commonsense knowledge. The use of more knowledge sources, however,
also increases the chance of retrieving more irrelevant or noisy facts, making
it difficult to comprehend the facts and find the answer. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-modal Answer Validation using External knowledge
(MAVEx), where the idea is to validate a set of promising answer candidates
based on answer-specific knowledge retrieval. This is in contrast to existing
approaches that search for the answer in a vast collection of often irrelevant
facts. Our approach aims to learn which knowledge source should be trusted for
each answer candidate and how to validate the candidate using that source. We
consider a multi-modal setting, relying on both textual and visual knowledge

                                        <span>Recently, there has been substantial progress in image synthesis from
semantic labelmaps. However, methods used for this task assume the availability
of complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and
class labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs
restricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world
applications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.
On the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps
or sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and
artists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few
objects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from
sparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\% of
object instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a
two-stage deep network based method, called &#x60;Halluci-Net&#x27;, that learns
co-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these
relationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense
labelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis
techniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is
evaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on
performance metrics like Fr\&#x27;echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic
segmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences. We also show
qualitative results on a subset of ADE20K dataset that contains bedroom images.</span>

                                        <span>Various fonts give us various impressions, which are often represented by
words. This paper proposes Impressions2Font (Imp2Font) that generates font
images with specific impressions. Imp2Font is an extended version of
conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). More precisely, Imp2Font
accepts an arbitrary number of impression words as the condition to generate
the font images. These impression words are converted into a soft-constraint
vector by an impression embedding module built on a word embedding technique.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations prove that Imp2Font generates font
images with higher quality than comparative methods by providing multiple
impression words or even unlearned words.</span>

                                        <span>Visual attention is one of the most significant characteristics for selecting
and understanding the outside redundancy world. The nature of complex scenes
includes enormous redundancy. The human vision system can not process all
information simultaneously because of visual information bottleneck. The human
visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of the scenes to reduce the
input visual redundancy information. It is commonly known as visual attention
prediction or visual saliency map. This paper proposes a new psychophysical
saliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by human low-level visual
cortex function. The model consists of opponent color channels, wavelet
transform, wavelet energy map, and contrast sensitivity function for extracting
low-level image features and maximum approximation to the human visual system.
The proposed model is evaluated several datasets, including MIT1003, MIT300,
TORONTO, SID4VAM and UCF Sports dataset to explain its efficiency. We also
quantitatively and qualitatively compared the performance of saliency
prediction with other state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved very stable
and good performance. Second, we also confirmed that Fourier and
spectral-inspired saliency prediction models achieved outperformance compared
to other start-of-the-art non-neural networks and even deep neural network
models on psychophysical synthesis images. Finally, the proposed model also can
be applied to spatial-temporal saliency prediction and got better performance.</span>

                                        <span>We propose an efficient and straightforward method for compressing deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that uses basis filters to represent the
convolutional layers, and optimizes the performance of the compressed network
directly in the basis space. Specifically, any spatial convolution layer of the
CNN can be replaced by two successive convolution layers: the first is a set of
three-dimensional orthonormal basis filters, followed by a layer of
one-dimensional filters that represents the original spatial filters in the
basis space. We jointly fine-tune both the basis and the filter representation
to directly mitigate any performance loss due to the truncation. Generality of
the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to several well known deep
CNN architectures and data sets for image classification and object detection.
We also present the execution time and power usage at different compression
levels on the Xavier Jetson AGX processor.</span>

classification of skin disease images; however these algorithms have been
mostly applied &quot;in silico&quot; and not validated clinically. Most dermatology AI
algorithms perform binary classification tasks (e.g. malignancy versus benign
lesions), but this task is not representative of dermatologists&#x27; diagnostic
range. The American Academy of Dermatology Task Force on Augmented Intelligence
published a position statement emphasizing the importance of clinical

(AuI). Liu et al&#x27;s recent paper, &quot;A deep learning system for differential
diagnosis of skin diseases&quot; represents a significant advancement of AI in
dermatology, bringing it closer to clinical impact. However, significant issues
must be addressed before this algorithm can be integrated into clinical
workflow. These issues include accurate and equitable model development,

variable playback speeds of a video. Without semantic labels, we learn the
spatio-temporal visual representation of the video by leveraging the variations
in the visual appearance according to different playback speeds under the
assumption of temporal coherence. To learn the spatio-temporal visual
variations in the entire video, we have not only predicted a single playback
speed but also generated clips of various playback speeds and directions with
randomized starting points. Hence the visual representation can be successfully
learned from the meta information (playback speeds and directions) of the
video. We also propose a new layer dependable temporal group normalization
method that can be applied to 3D convolutional networks to improve the
representation learning performance where we divide the temporal features into
several groups and normalize each one using the different corresponding
parameters. We validate the effectiveness of our method by fine-tuning it to

transformations, such as scale and rotation, repeatable in the case of
occlusions and clutter, and generalisable in different contexts when data is
captured with different sensors. We present a simple but yet effective method
to learn generalisable and distinctive 3D local descriptors that can be used to
register point clouds captured in different contexts with different sensors.
Point cloud patches are extracted, canonicalised with respect to their local
reference frame, and encoded into scale and rotation-invariant compact
descriptors by a point permutation-invariant deep neural network. Our
descriptors can effectively generalise across sensor modalities from locally
and randomly sampled points. We evaluate and compare our descriptors with
alternative handcrafted and deep learning-based descriptors on several indoor
and outdoor datasets reconstructed using both RGBD sensors and laser scanners.
Our descriptors outperform most recent descriptors by a large margin in terms
of generalisation, and become the state of the art also in benchmarks where
training and testing are performed in the same scenarios.</span>

a deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which
randomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard
distributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more
informed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where
each layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is
cast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and
decoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a
user-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into
the well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free
solutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to
random initialization methods, both before start of training and after training
is over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot
and fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time
complexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the greatest advances in AI
in recent years. With their ability to directly learn the probability
distribution of data, and then sample synthetic realistic data. Many
applications have emerged, using GANs to solve classical problems in machine
learning, such as data augmentation, class unbalance problems, and fair
representation learning. In this paper, we analyze and highlight fairness
concerns of GANs model. In this regard, we show empirically that GANs models
may inherently prefer certain groups during the training process and therefore
they&#x27;re not able to homogeneously generate data from different groups during
the testing phase. Furthermore, we propose solutions to solve this issue by
conditioning the GAN model towards samples&#x27; group or using ensemble method
(boosting) to allow the GAN model to leverage distributed structure of data
during the training phase and generate groups at equal rate during the testing
phase.</span>

novel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is
represented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a
corresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view
rendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is
characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D
function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a
deep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize
the 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.
Different from previous light field approaches which require dense view
sampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by
sampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,
thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training
images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while
maintaining an interactive frame rate.</span>

                                        <span>Real-time detection of objects in the 3D scene is one of the tasks an
autonomous agent needs to perform for understanding its surroundings. While
recent Deep Learning-based solutions achieve satisfactory performance, their
high computational cost renders their application in real-life settings in
which computations need to be performed on embedded platforms intractable. In
this paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object
detection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and
speed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large
distances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded
platforms equipped with high-performance GPUs. Our experiments show that these
methods mostly fail to detect distant small objects due to the sparsity of the
input point clouds at large distances. Moreover, models trained on near objects
achieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects
in the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance
representations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a
considerable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on
locations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection. This
means that the methods can achieve a speed-up of $40$-$60\%$ by restricting
operation to near objects while not sacrificing much in performance.</span>

of the input data. In this paper, we propose a convolutional predictor that is
invariant to rotations in the input. This architecture is capable of predicting

                                        <span>In image anomaly detection, Autoencoders are the popular methods that
reconstruct the input image that might contain anomalies and output a clean
image with no abnormalities. These Autoencoder-based methods usually calculate
the anomaly score from the reconstruction error, the difference between the
input image and the reconstructed image. On the other hand, the accuracy of the
reconstruction is insufficient in many of these methods, so it leads to
degraded accuracy of anomaly detection. To improve the accuracy of the
reconstruction, we consider defining loss function in the frequency domain. In
general, we know that natural images contain many low-frequency components and
few high-frequency components. Hence, to improve the accuracy of the
reconstruction of high-frequency components, we introduce a new loss function
named weighted frequency domain loss(WFDL). WFDL provides a sharper
reconstructed image, which contributes to improving the accuracy of anomaly
detection. In this paper, we show our method&#x27;s superiority over the
conventional Autoencoder methods by comparing it with AUROC on the MVTec AD
dataset.</span>

However, most of the recent methods focus on improving accuracy using
complicated models and ignoring real-time efficiency. To achieve a better
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a novel neural
architecture search (NAS) method, termed ViPNAS, to search networks in both
spatial and temporal levels for fast online video pose estimation. In the
spatial level, we carefully design the search space with five different
dimensions including network depth, width, kernel size, group number, and
attentions. In the temporal level, we search from a series of temporal feature
fusions to optimize the total accuracy and speed across multiple video frames.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to search for the temporal
feature fusion and automatic computation allocation in videos. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
COCO2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets. Our discovered model family, S-ViPNAS and
T-ViPNAS, achieve significantly higher inference speed (CPU real-time) without
sacrificing the accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head
self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image
patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such
flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can
facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain
shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We
systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments
encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing
convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following
intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe
occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.
(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local
textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to
CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate
shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,
previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape
representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic
segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a
single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high
accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional
and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to
flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention
mechanism.</span>

                                        <span>Domain shift has always been one of the primary issues in video object
segmentation (VOS), for which models suffer from degeneration when tested on
unfamiliar datasets. Recently, many online methods have emerged to narrow the
performance gap between training data (source domain) and test data (target
domain) by fine-tuning on annotations of test data which are usually in
shortage. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle domain shift by
first introducing adversarial domain adaptation to the VOS task, with
supervised training on the source domain and unsupervised training on the
target domain. By fusing appearance and motion features with a convolution
layer, and by adding supervision onto the motion branch, our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS2016 with 82.6% mean IoU score after
supervised training. Meanwhile, our adversarial domain adaptation strategy
significantly raises the performance of the trained model when applied on
FBMS59 and Youtube-Object, without exploiting extra annotations.</span>

                                        <span>Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The
Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. This
is obtained via the visual analysis of cancerous patterns in prostate biopsies
performed by expert pathologists, and the aggregation of the main Gleason
grades in a combined score. Computer-aided diagnosis systems allow to reduce
the workload of pathologists and increase the objectivity. Recently, efforts
have been made in the literature to develop algorithms aiming the direct
estimation of the global Gleason score at biopsy/core level with global labels.
However, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason
patterns into the tissue. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system
able to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the
global-level Gleason score during training. The methodological core of this
work is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network,
WeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature
extraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background
class for the model loss estimation during training. We obtained a Cohen&#x27;s
quadratic kappa (k) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous
patterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for
semantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art
architectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level k of 0.61 and a
macro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods.
Regarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of
0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists. WeGleNet is
capable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to
fully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents a novel algorithm that registers a collection of
mono-modal 3D images in a simultaneous fashion, named as Direct Simultaneous
Registration (DSR). The algorithm optimizes global poses of local frames
directly based on the intensities of images (without extracting features from
the images). To obtain the optimal result, we start with formulating a Direct
Bundle Adjustment (DBA) problem which jointly optimizes pose parameters of
local frames and intensities of panoramic image. By proving the independence of
the pose from panoramic image in the iterative process, DSR is proposed and
proved to be able to generate the same optimal poses as DBA, but without
optimizing the intensities of the panoramic image. The proposed DSR method is
particularly suitable in mono-modal registration and in the scenarios where
distinct features are not available, such as Transesophageal Echocardiography
(TEE) images. The proposed method is validated via simulated and in-vivo 3D TEE
images. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms conventional
sequential registration method in terms of accuracy and the obtained results
can produce good alignment in in-vivo images.</span>

                                        <span>Covid-19 global pandemic continues to devastate health care systems across
the world. In many countries, the 2nd wave is very severe. Economical and rapid
testing, as well as diagnosis, is urgently needed to control the pandemic. At
present, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR)
testing can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing
methods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19. Thus,
inspired by the limitations of the open-source work in this field, we propose
attention guided contrastive CNN architecture (AC-CovidNet) for Covid-19
detection in CXR images. The proposed method learns the robust and
discriminative features with the help of contrastive loss. Moreover, the
proposed method gives more importance to the infected regions as guided by the
attention mechanism. We compute the sensitivity of the proposed method over the
publicly available Covid-19 dataset. It is observed that the proposed
AC-CovidNet exhibits very promising performance as compared to the existing
methods even with limited training data. It can tackle the bottleneck of CXR
Covid-19 datasets being faced by the researchers. The code used in this paper

                                        <span>Owing to the difficulties of mining spatial-temporal cues, the existing
approaches for video salient object detection (VSOD) are limited in
understanding complex and noisy scenarios, and often fail in inferring
prominent objects. To alleviate such shortcomings, we propose a simple yet
efficient architecture, termed Guidance and Teaching Network (GTNet), to
independently distil effective spatial and temporal cues with implicit guidance
and explicit teaching at feature- and decision-level, respectively. To be
specific, we (a) introduce a temporal modulator to implicitly bridge features
from motion into the appearance branch, which is capable of fusing cross-modal
features collaboratively, and (b) utilise motion-guided mask to propagate the
explicit cues during the feature aggregation. This novel learning strategy
achieves satisfactory results via decoupling the complex spatial-temporal cues
and mapping informative cues across different modalities. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks show that the proposed method can run at ~28
fps on a single TITAN Xp GPU and perform competitively against 14 cutting-edge
baselines.</span>

intelligence has emerged as a promising way to lighten the computation load on
edge devices that run applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Typically, a deep model is split at a certain layer into edge and cloud
sub-models. The deep feature tensor produced by the edge sub-model is
transmitted to the cloud, where the remaining computationally intensive
workload is performed by the cloud sub-model. The communication channel between
the edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep
feature tensor received at the cloud side. In this study, we examine the
effectiveness of four low-rank tensor completion methods in recovering missing
data in the deep feature tensor. We consider both sparse tensors, such as those
produced by the VGG16 model, as well as non-sparse tensors, such as those
produced by ResNet34 model. We study tensor completion effectiveness in both
conplexity-constrained and unconstrained scenario.</span>

interpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data
compression and discriminative representation. We show that for
high-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative
representation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset
and the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient
ascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a
multi-layer deep network, named ReduNet, that shares common characteristics of
modern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear
operators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed
layer-by-layer via forward propagation, instead of learned via back
propagation. All components of so-obtained &quot;white-box&quot; network have precise
optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear
operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions
when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation
also indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more
efficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary
simulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate
reduction objective and the associated ReduNet. All code and data are available

                                        <span>Over the past decades, enormous efforts have been made to improve the
performance of linear or nonlinear mixing models for hyperspectral unmixing,
yet their ability to simultaneously generalize various spectral variabilities
and extract physically meaningful endmembers still remains limited due to the
poor ability in data fitting and reconstruction and the sensitivity to various
spectral variabilities. Inspired by the powerful learning ability of deep
learning, we attempt to develop a general deep learning approach for
hyperspectral unmixing, by fully considering the properties of endmembers
extracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing
network (EGU-Net). Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a
two-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the
pure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing
network by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful
constraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and
interpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework
is not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to
spatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral
unmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the
ground-truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms. The codes will be available from the website:

                                        <span>Few-shot learning (FSL) is the task of learning to recognize previously
unseen categories of images from a small number of training examples. This is a
challenging task, as the available examples may not be enough to unambiguously
determine which visual features are most characteristic of the considered
categories. To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that additionally
takes into account the names of the image classes. While the use of class names
has already been explored in previous work, our approach differs in two key
aspects. First, while previous work has aimed to directly predict visual
prototypes from word embeddings, we found that better results can be obtained
by treating visual and text-based prototypes separately. Second, we propose a
simple strategy for learning class name embeddings using the BERT language

used in previous work. We furthermore propose a strategy for dealing with the
high dimensionality of these vectors, inspired by models for aligning
cross-lingual word embeddings. We provide experiments on miniImageNet, CUB and
tieredImageNet, showing that our approach consistently improves the
state-of-the-art in metric-based FSL.</span>

constancy. The proposed method, called &quot;n-color balancing,&quot; allows us not only
to perfectly correct n target colors on the basis of corresponding ground truth
colors but also to correct colors other than the n colors. In contrast,
although white-balancing can perfectly adjust white, colors other than white

both conventional white and multi-color balance adjustments including

learning to recognize fine-grained classes with a few or no training samples.
Our key observation is that generating holistic features for fine-grained
classes fails to capture small attribute differences between classes.
Therefore, we propose a feature composition framework that learns to extract
attribute features from training samples and combines them to construct
fine-grained features for rare and unseen classes. Feature composition allows
us to not only selectively compose features of every class from only relevant
training samples, but also obtain diversity among composed features via
changing samples used for the composition. In addition, instead of building
holistic features for classes, we use our attribute features to form dense
representations capable of capturing fine-grained attribute details of classes.
We propose a training scheme that uses a discriminative model to construct
features that are subsequently used to train the model itself. Therefore, we
directly train the discriminative model on the composed features without
learning a separate generative model. We conduct experiments on four popular
datasets of DeepFashion, AWA2, CUB, and SUN, showing the effectiveness of our
method.</span>

                                        <span>Orthopedic disorders are a common cause for euthanasia among horses, which
often could have been avoided with earlier detection. These conditions often
create varying degrees of subtle but long-term pain. It is challenging to train
a visual pain recognition method with video data depicting such pain, since the
resulting pain behavior also is subtle, sparsely appearing, and varying, making
it challenging for even an expert human labeler to provide accurate
ground-truth for the data. We show that transferring features from a dataset of
horses with acute nociceptive pain (where labeling is less ambiguous) can aid
the learning to recognize more complex orthopedic pain. Moreover, we present a
human expert baseline for the problem, as well as an extensive empirical study
of various domain transfer methods and of what is detected by the pain
recognition method trained on acute pain in the orthopedic dataset. Finally,
this is accompanied with a discussion around the challenges posed by real-world
animal behavior datasets and how best practices can be established for similar
fine-grained action recognition tasks. Our code is available at

                                        <span>Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often
found in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity
in trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is
frequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in
busy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide
substantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending
trauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform
grading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to
enable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering
insights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an
automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist
radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method
operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects
distinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model
that are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical
best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and
finally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures
that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating
point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and
corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides
finding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on
important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system&#x27;s recommendation and
achieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.
Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not
compromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.</span>

                                        <span>We present a learning-based method for building driving-signal aware
full-body avatars. Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can
be animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial
keypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and
view-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better
drivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving
signals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during
animation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the
driving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the
remaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors
required during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving
signal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving
signal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence
of global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving
signal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty
for missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a
particular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the
challenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with
driving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and
mounted on a VR-headset.</span>

                                        <span>Many efforts have been devoted to designing sampling, mining, and weighting
strategies in high-level deep metric learning (DML) loss objectives. However,
little attention has been paid to low-level but essential data transformation.
In this paper, we develop a novel mechanism, the independent domain embedding
augmentation learning ({IDEAL}) method. It can simultaneously learn multiple
independent embedding spaces for multiple domains generated by predefined data
transformations. Our IDEAL is orthogonal to existing DML techniques and can be
seamlessly combined with prior DML approaches for enhanced performance.
Empirical results on visual retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method. For example, the IDEAL improves the performance of MS loss by
a large margin, 84.5\% $\rightarrow$ 87.1\% on Cars-196, and 65.8\%
$\rightarrow$ 69.5\% on CUB-200 at Recall$@1$. Our IDEAL with MS loss also
achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on three image retrieval
benchmarks, \ie, \emph{Cars-196}, \emph{CUB-200}, and \emph{SOP}. It
outperforms the most recent DML approaches, such as Circle loss and XBM,
significantly. The source code and pre-trained models of our method will be

interpretation and analysis has become critical. This is particularly true when
data comes from complex systems where extensive structure is available, but
must be drawn from peripheral sources. In this paper we argue that in such
situations, sheaves can provide a natural framework to analyze how well a
statistical model fits at the local level (that is, on subsets of related

cancers in clinical practice. The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram
images provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior
structure and is of great significance in digital mammography interpretation.
However, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to
identify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing
object detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital
for decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore.
In this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN),
which is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection
methods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three
steps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to
model the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views.
Secondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely
adopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we
propose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural
similarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the
multi-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips
the features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability.
Experiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN significantly exceeds
the state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results show that AGN provides
interpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis.</span>

occluded body parts and ambiguous poses. Graph convolutional networks encode
the structural information of the human skeleton in the form of an adjacency
matrix, which is beneficial for better pose prediction. We propose one such
graph convolutional network named PoseGraphNet for 3D human pose regression
from 2D poses. Our network uses an adaptive adjacency matrix and kernels
specific to neighbor groups. We evaluate our model on the Human3.6M dataset

close to the state-of-the-art, but with much fewer parameters. The model learns
interesting adjacency relations between joints that have no physical

                                        <span>Hidden features in neural network usually fail to learn informative
representation for 3D segmentation as supervisions are only given on output
prediction, while this can be solved by omni-scale supervision on intermediate
layers. In this paper, we bring the first omni-scale supervision method to
point cloud segmentation via the proposed gradual Receptive Field Component
Reasoning (RFCR), where target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are
designed to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the
encoder. Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the
RFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the
semantic labels. Because many hidden features are inactive with tiny magnitude
and make minor contributions to RFCC prediction, we propose a Feature
Densification with a centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features,
and it is in effect equivalent to entropy regularization over features. More
active features can further unleash the potential of our omni-supervision
method. We embed our method into four prevailing backbones and test on three
challenging benchmarks. Our method can significantly improve the backbones in
all three datasets. Specifically, our method brings new state-of-the-art
performances for S3DIS as well as Semantic3D and ranks the 1st in the ScanNet
benchmark among all the point-based methods. Code will be publicly available at

                                        <span>Transformer models have recently attracted much interest from computer vision
researchers and have since been successfully employed for several problems
traditionally addressed with convolutional neural networks. At the same time,
image synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically
improved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first
GAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results
when compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are
data-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary
super-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the
self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a
transformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully
remove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our
approach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the
size of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both
architectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.
Furthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated
images and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based
generator.</span>

a principled probabilistic approach to modelling input-dependent, also known as
heteroscedastic, label noise in these datasets. We place a multivariate Normal
distributed latent variable on the final hidden layer of a neural network
classifier. The covariance matrix of this latent variable, models the aleatoric
uncertainty due to label noise. We demonstrate that the learned covariance
structure captures known sources of label noise between semantically similar
and co-occurring classes. Compared to standard neural network training and
other baselines, we show significantly improved accuracy on Imagenet ILSVRC
2012 79.3% (+2.6%), Imagenet-21k 47.0% (+1.1%) and JFT 64.7% (+1.6%). We set a

to the ultra-large-scale and well-labeled datasets. However, training on
ultra-large-scale datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware
resource. Therefore, how to design an appropriate training approach is very
crucial and indispensable. The computational and hardware cost of training
ultra-large-scale datasets mainly focuses on the Fully-Connected (FC) layer
rather than convolutional layers. To this end, we propose a novel training
approach for ultra-large-scale face datasets, termed Faster Face Classification
(F$^2$C). In F$^2$C, we first define a Gallery Net and a Probe Net that are
used to generate identities&#x27; centers and extract faces&#x27; features for face
recognition, respectively. Gallery Net has the same structure as Probe Net and
inherits the parameters from Probe Net with a moving average paradigm. After
that, to reduce the training time and hardware resource occupancy of the FC
layer, we propose the Dynamic Class Pool that stores the features from Gallery
Net and calculates the inner product (logits) with positive samples (its
identities appear in Dynamic Class Pool) in each mini-batch. Dynamic Class Pool
can be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer and its size is much smaller
than FC, which is the reason why Dynamic Class Pool can largely reduce the time
and resource cost. For negative samples (its identities are not appear in the
Dynamic Class Pool), we minimize the cosine similarities between negative
samples and Dynamic Class Pool. Then, to improve the update efficiency and
speed of Dynamic Class Pool&#x27;s parameters, we design the Dual Loaders including
Identity-based and Instance-based Loaders. Dual Loaders load images from given
dataset by instances and identities to generate batches for training.</span>

applied root modules to SISR problem, further more to make the model uint8

achieved great balance between reconstruction quality and runtime. Furthermore,

morphological evaluation of the pediatric musculoskeletal system in clinical
practice. However, the accuracy and generalization performance of individual
segmentation models are limited due to the restricted amount of annotated

scarcity of pediatric data while benefiting from a more robust shared
representation. The proposed segmentation network comprises shared
convolutional filters, domain-specific batch normalization parameters that
compute the respective dataset statistics and a domain-specific segmentation
layer. Furthermore, a supervised contrastive regularization is integrated to
further improve generalization capabilities, by promoting intra-domain
similarity and impose inter-domain margins in embedded space. We evaluate our
contributions on two pediatric imaging datasets of the ankle and shoulder
joints for bone segmentation. Results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, text detection has attracted sufficient attention in the field of
computer vision and artificial intelligence. Among the existing approaches,
regression-based models are limited to handle the texts with arbitrary shapes,
while segmentation-based algorithms have high computational costs and suffer
from the text adhesion problem. In this paper, we propose a new one-stage text
detector, termed as Bold Outline Text Detector (BOTD), which is able to process
the arbitrary-shaped text with low model complexity. Different from previous
works, BOTD utilizes the Polar Minimum Distance (PMD) to encode the shortest
distance between the center point and the contour of the text instance, and
generates a Center Mask (CM) for each text instance. After learning the PMD
heat map and CM map, the final results can be obtained with a simple Text
Reconstruction Module (TRM). Since the CM resides within the text box exactly,
the text adhesion problem is avoided naturally. Meanwhile, all the points on
the text contour share the same PMD, so the complexity of BOTD is much lower
than existing segmentation-based methods. Experimental results on three
real-world benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of BOTD.</span>

image, and are of primary significance to applications such as image matching
and motion analysis. Previous event-based feature extraction methods are mainly
focused on corners, which mainly find their locations, however, ignoring the
geometrical structure information like orientations and scales of edges. This
paper adapts the frame-based a-contrario junction detector(ACJ) to event data,
proposing the event-based a-contrario junction detector(e-ACJ), which yields
junctions&#x27; locations while giving the scales and orientations of their
branches. The proposed method relies on an a-contrario model and can operate on
asynchronous events directly without generating synthesized event frames. We
evaluate the performance on public event datasets. The result shows our method
successfully finds the orientations and scales of branches, while maintaining
high accuracy in junction&#x27;s location.</span>

                                        <span>As remote sensing (RS) data obtained from different sensors become available
largely and openly, multimodal data processing and analysis techniques have
been garnering increasing interest in the RS and geoscience community. However,
due to the gap between different modalities in terms of imaging sensors,
resolutions, and contents, embedding their complementary information into a
consistent, compact, accurate, and discriminative representation, to a great
extent, remains challenging. To this end, we propose a shared and specific
feature learning (S2FL) model. S2FL is capable of decomposing multimodal RS
data into modality-shared and modality-specific components, enabling the
information blending of multi-modalities more effectively, particularly for
heterogeneous data sources. Moreover, to better assess multimodal baselines and
the newly-proposed S2FL model, three multimodal RS benchmark datasets, i.e.,
Houston2013 -- hyperspectral and multispectral data, Berlin -- hyperspectral
and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, Augsburg -- hyperspectral, SAR, and
digital surface model (DSM) data, are released and used for land cover
classification. Extensive experiments conducted on the three datasets
demonstrate the superiority and advancement of our S2FL model in the task of
land cover classification in comparison with previously-proposed
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the baseline codes and datasets used
in this paper will be made available freely at

from a set of constraints of the form &quot;item $j$ is closer to item $i$ than item

metric space. We argue that mapping to a density instead of a point vector
provides some interesting advantages, including an inherent reflection of the
uncertainty about the representation itself and its relative location in the
space. Indeed, in this paper, we propose to embed each object as a Gaussian
distribution. We investigate the ability of these embeddings to capture the
underlying structure of the data while satisfying the constraints, and explore
properties of the representation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets showcase the advantages of our approach. In addition, we illustrate
the merit of modelling uncertainty, which enriches the visual perception of the

an image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are
vulnerable to backdoor attacks where an attacker poisons a part of the
unlabeled data by adding a small trigger (known to the attacker) to the images.
The model performance is good on clean test images but the attacker can
manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time.
Backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised
learning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning since
the unlabeled data is large and as a result, an inspection of the data to avoid
the presence of poisoned data is prohibitive. We show that in our targeted
attack, the attacker can produce many false positives for the target category
by using the trigger at test time. We also propose a knowledge distillation
based defense algorithm that succeeds in neutralizing the attack. Our code is

                                        <span>Annotating images for semantic segmentation requires intense manual labor and
is a time-consuming and expensive task especially for domains with a scarcity
of experts, such as Forensic Anthropology. We leverage the evolving nature of
images depicting the decay process in human decomposition data to design a
simple yet effective pseudo-pixel-level label generation technique to reduce
the amount of effort for manual annotation of such images. We first identify
sequences of images with a minimum variation that are most suitable to share
the same or similar annotation using an unsupervised approach. Given one
user-annotated image in each sequence, we propagate the annotation to the
remaining images in the sequence by merging it with annotations produced by a
state-of-the-art CAM-based pseudo label generation technique. To evaluate the
quality of our pseudo-pixel-level labels, we train two semantic segmentation
models with VGG and ResNet backbones on images labeled using our pseudo
labeling method and those of a state-of-the-art method. The results indicate
that using our pseudo-labels instead of those generated using the
state-of-the-art method in the training process improves the mean-IoU and the
frequency-weighted-IoU of the VGG and ResNet-based semantic segmentation models
by 3.36%, 2.58%, 10.39%, and 12.91% respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Intrinsic Image Decomposition is an open problem of generating the
constituents of an image. Generating reflectance and shading from a single
image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There
is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into
reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network
architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters
derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the
proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID
techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly.
We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example
images) showing several avenues for improvement.</span>

can accept either video or text input, or both for a variety of end tasks.
Existing pre-training are task-specific by adopting either a single cross-modal
encoder that requires both modalities, limiting their use for retrieval-style
end tasks or more complex multitask learning with two unimodal encoders,
limiting early cross-modal fusion. We instead introduce new pretraining masking
schemes that better mix across modalities (e.g. by forcing masks for text to
predict the closest video embeddings) while also maintaining separability (e.g.
unimodal predictions are sometimes required, without using all the input).
Experimental results show strong performance across a wider range of tasks than

                                        <span>This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing the surface shape of
transparent objects. The difficulty of this problem originates from the
viewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes
reconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In
this paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface
reconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present
a simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light
rays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and
develop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and
triangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to
model the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,
neither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact
number of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can
therefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and
structure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that
for thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further
simplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results
on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our
proposed approach.</span>

pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for

                                        <span>Single image super-resolution (SISR) deals with a fundamental problem of
upsampling a low-resolution (LR) image to its high-resolution (HR) version.
Last few years have witnessed impressive progress propelled by deep learning
methods. However, one critical challenge faced by existing methods is to strike
a sweet spot of deep model complexity and resulting SISR quality. This paper
addresses this pain point by proposing a linearly-assembled pixel-adaptive
regression network (LAPAR), which casts the direct LR to HR mapping learning
into a linear coefficient regression task over a dictionary of multiple
predefined filter bases. Such a parametric representation renders our model
highly lightweight and easy to optimize while achieving state-of-the-art
results on SISR benchmarks. Moreover, based on the same idea, LAPAR is extended
to tackle other restoration tasks, e.g., image denoising and JPEG image
deblocking, and again, yields strong performance. The code is available at

level commands to navigate. However, few evaluations are made on the ability of
these agents to react in an unexpected situation. Specifically, no evaluations
are conducted on the robustness of driving agents in the event of a bad
high-level command. We propose here an evaluation method, namely a benchmark
that allows to assess the robustness of an agent, and to appreciate its
understanding of the environment through its ability to keep a safe behavior,
regardless of the instruction.</span>

                                        <span>The task of predicting smooth and edge-consistent depth maps is notoriously
difficult for single image depth estimation. This paper proposes a novel
Bilateral Grid based 3D convolutional neural network, dubbed as 3DBG-UNet, that
parameterizes high dimensional feature space by encoding compact 3D bilateral
grids with UNets and infers sharp geometric layout of the scene. Further,
another novel 3DBGES-UNet model is introduced that integrate 3DBG-UNet for
inferring an accurate depth map given a single color view. The 3DBGES-UNet
concatenates 3DBG-UNet geometry map with the inception network edge
accentuation map and a spatial object&#x27;s boundary map obtained by leveraging
semantic segmentation and train the UNet model with ResNet backbone. Both
models are designed with a particular attention to explicitly account for edges
or minute details. Preserving sharp discontinuities at depth edges is critical
for many applications such as realistic integration of virtual objects in AR
video or occlusion-aware view synthesis for 3D display applications.The
proposed depth prediction network achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the challenging NYUv2-Depth data.
The code and corresponding pre-trained weights will be made publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Story visualization is an under-explored task that falls at the intersection
of many important research directions in both computer vision and natural
language processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions
which compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that
correspond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative
models which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,
there is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,
coherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling
approaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that
utilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story
and generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for
sequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to
model complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to
demonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of
the model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.
Furthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard
evaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also
provide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects
of the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,
the relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images. We also
present correlation experiments of our proposed automated metrics with human
evaluations. Code and data available at:

                                        <span>Over the last few decades, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used
to diagnose and monitor different lung diseases in neonates. It is a non
invasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination while minimally handling
the neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts
concerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns
found in different respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the
operator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in
automated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model for
diagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The
algorithm should output LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead.
Therefore, in this paper we present a unique approach for extracting seven
meaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific
pathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura,
Alines, Coalescent B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These
artifacts can lead to early prediction of infants developing later respiratory
distress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based object detection
model faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos
to detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal
diseases. Our results show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as
RetinaNet and can successfully detect the aforementioned LUS features with a
mean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic diagnosis from
images without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the
ultimate control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more
trustworthy intelligent system.</span>

have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing
datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap
between a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting
problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same
task on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal
knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to
effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to
traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be
lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student
model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its
teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify
this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised
learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand
the denoising capability of a multimodal student.</span>

                                        <span>3D object detection is a core component of automated driving systems.
State-of-the-art methods fuse RGB imagery and LiDAR point cloud data
frame-by-frame for 3D bounding box regression. However, frame-by-frame 3D
object detection suffers from noise, field-of-view obstruction, and sparsity.
We propose a novel Temporal Fusion Module (TFM) to use information from
previous time-steps to mitigate these problems. First, a state-of-the-art
frustum network extracts point cloud features from raw RGB and LiDAR point
cloud data frame-by-frame. Then, our TFM module fuses these features with a
recurrent neural network. As a result, 3D object detection becomes robust
against single frame failures and transient occlusions. Experiments on the
KITTI object tracking dataset show the efficiency of the proposed TFM, where we
obtain ~6%, ~4%, and ~6% improvements on Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist classes,
respectively, compared to frame-by-frame baselines. Furthermore, ablation
studies reinforce that the subject of improvement is temporal fusion and show
the effects of different placements of TFM in the object detection pipeline.

                                        <span>Deep learning has shown a great improvement in the performance of visual
tasks. Image retrieval is the task of extracting the visually similar images
from a database for a query image. The feature matching is performed to rank
the images. Various hand-designed features have been derived in past to
represent the images. Nowadays, the power of deep learning is being utilized
for automatic feature learning from data in the field of biomedical image
analysis. Autoencoder and Siamese networks are two deep learning models to
learn the latent space (i.e., features or embedding). Autoencoder works based
on the reconstruction of the image from latent space. Siamese network utilizes
the triplets to learn the intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity.
Moreover, Autoencoder is unsupervised, whereas Siamese network is supervised.
We propose a Joint Triplet Autoencoder Network (JTANet) by facilitating the
triplet learning in autoencoder framework. A joint supervised learning for
Siamese network and unsupervised learning for Autoencoder is performed.
Moreover, the Encoder network of Autoencoder is shared with Siamese network and
referred as the Siamcoder network. The features are extracted by using the
trained Siamcoder network for retrieval purpose. The experiments are performed
over Histopathological Routine Colon Cancer dataset. We have observed the
promising performance using the proposed JTANet model against the Autoencoder

                                        <span>Toward a computer-assisted marking for descriptive math questions,this paper
presents clustering of online handwritten mathematical expressions (OnHMEs) to
help human markers to mark them efficiently and reliably. We propose a
generative sequence similarity function for computing a similarity score of two
OnHMEs based on a sequence-to-sequence OnHME recognizer. Each OnHME is
represented by a similarity-based representation (SbR) vector. The SbR matrix
is inputted to the k-means algorithm for clustering OnHMEs. Experiments are
conducted on an answer dataset (Dset_Mix) of 200 OnHMEs mixed of real patterns
and synthesized patterns for each of 10 questions and a real online handwritten
mathematical answer dataset of 122 student answers at most for each of 15
questions (NIER_CBT). The best clustering results achieved around 0.916 and
0.915 for purity, and around 0.556 and 0.702 for the marking cost on Dset_Mix
and NIER_CBT, respectively. Our method currently outperforms the previous
methods for clustering HMEs.</span>

                                        <span>The need for accurate yield estimates for viticulture is becoming more
important due to increasing competition in the wine market worldwide. One of
the most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can
be approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this
article, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries
with leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that
will enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial
networks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario
behind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded
berries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after
applying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to
applying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local
conditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.
Furthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image
should be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring
information about hidden areas.</span>

                                        <span>Cancelable biometric techniques have been used to prevent the compromise of
biometric data by generating and using their corresponding cancelable templates
for user authentication. However, the non-invertible distance preserving
transformation methods employed in various schemes are often vulnerable to
information leakage since matching is performed in the transformed domain. In
this paper, we propose a non-invertible distance preserving scheme based on
vector permutation and shift-order process. First, the dimension of feature
vectors is reduced using kernelized principle component analysis (KPCA) prior
to randomly permuting the extracted vector features. A shift-order process is
then applied to the generated features in order to achieve non-invertibility
and combat similarity-based attacks. The generated hash codes are resilient to
different security and privacy attacks whilst fulfilling the major revocability
and unlinkability requirements. Experimental evaluation conducted on 6 datasets
of FVC2002 and FVC2004 reveals a high-performance accuracy of the proposed
scheme better than other existing state-of-the-art schemes.</span>

                                        <span>Scale variation is one of the most challenging problems in face detection.
Modern face detectors employ feature pyramids to deal with scale variation.
However, it might break the feature consistency across different scales of
faces. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method named the
receptive field pyramids (RFP) method to enhance the representation ability of
feature pyramids. It can learn different receptive fields in each feature map
adaptively based on the varying scales of detected faces. Empirical results on
two face detection benchmark datasets, i.e., WIDER FACE and UFDD, demonstrate
that our proposed method can accelerate the inference rate significantly while
achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source code of our method is

                                        <span>There has been a widely held view that visual representations (e.g.,
photographs and illustrations) do not depict negation, for example, one that
can be expressed by a sentence &quot;the train is not coming&quot;. This view is
empirically challenged by analyzing the real-world visual representations of
comic (manga) illustrations. In the experiment using image captioning tasks, we
gave people comic illustrations and asked them to explain what they could read
from them. The collected data showed that some comic illustrations could depict
negation without any aid of sequences (multiple panels) or conventional devices
(special symbols). This type of comic illustrations was subjected to further
experiments, classifying images into those containing negation and those not
containing negation. While this image classification was easy for humans, it
was difficult for data-driven machines, i.e., deep learning models (CNN), to
achieve the same high performance. Given the findings, we argue that some comic
illustrations evoke background knowledge and thus can depict negation with
purely visual elements.</span>

proposal is to move beyond pixel-level metrics: Given two images with each

the clustering of pixels being class-flipped or the location of occurrence,
reflect a different level of safety criticality. The result evaluated on an

shown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of
erythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have
been assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a 20-second

training. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders the
application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this paper,
we present a fully automated system, called CapillaryNet, that can automate
microvascular microscopy analysis so it can be used as a clinical application.
Moreover, CapillaryNet measures several microvascular parameters that

open-domain QA. SF-QA framework modularizes the pipeline open-domain QA system,
which makes the task itself easily accessible and reproducible to research
groups without enough computing resources. The proposed evaluation framework is
publicly available and anyone can contribute to the code and evaluations.</span>

(CTR) prediction, which is one of the most typical machine learning tasks in
personalized advertising and recommender systems. Although developing
hand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it
generally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive
scenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods
have been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing
methods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction
generation, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems,
we propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions
named AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI
adopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is
generalized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in
the edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It
allows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher
AUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI
utilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly
low computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite
of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of
AutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in many
industrial applications, and recently a lot of attention is paid to the deep
interest models which use attention mechanism to capture user interests from
historical behaviors. However, most current models are based on sequential
models which truncate the behavior sequences by a fixed length, thus have
difficulties in handling very long behavior sequences. Another big problem is
that sequences with the same length can be quite different in terms of time,
carrying completely different meanings. In this paper, we propose a
non-sequential approach to tackle the above problems. Specifically, we first
represent the behavior data in a sparse key-vector format, where the vector
contains rich behavior info such as time, count and category. Next, we enhance
the Deep Interest Network to take such rich information into account by a novel
attention network. The sparse representation makes it practical to handle large
scale long behavior sequences. Finally, we introduce a multidimensional
partition framework to mine behavior interactions. The framework can partition
data into custom designed time buckets to capture the interactions among
information aggregated in different time buckets. Similarly, it can also
partition the data into different categories and capture the interactions among
them. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets: one is an advertising
dataset and the other is a production recommender dataset. Our models
outperform other state-of-the-art models on both datasets.</span>

applied to improve numerous processes, such as inventory management in retail
stores. However, automatic localization of RFID-tagged goods in stores is still
a challenging problem. To address this issue, we equip fixtures (e.g., shelves)
with reference tags and use data we collect during RFID-based stocktakes to map
articles to fixtures. Knowing the location of goods enables the implementation
of several practical applications, such as automated Money Mapping (i.e., a
heat map of sales across fixtures). Specifically, we conduct controlled lab
experiments and a case-study in two fashion retail stores to evaluate our
article-to-fixture prediction approaches. The approaches are based on
calculating distances between read event time series using DTW, and clustering
of read events using DBSCAN. We find that, read events collected during
RFID-based stocktakes can be used to assign articles to fixtures with an
accuracy of more than 90%. Additionally, we conduct a pilot to investigate the
challenges related to the integration of such a localization system in the
day-to-day business of retail stores. Hence, in this paper we present an
exploratory venture into novel and practical RFID-based applications in fashion
retails stores, beyond the scope of stock management.</span>

could help with reducing redundancy, and promoting results that might not be
shown otherwise. Many previous methods have been proposed for this task.
However, previous methods do not explicitly consider the uniformity of the
number of the items&#x27; classes, or evenness, which could degrade the search and
recommendation quality. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method by
adapting the Simpson&#x27;s Diversity Index from biology, which enables a more
effective and efficient quadratic search result diversification algorithm. We
also extend the method to balance the diversity between multiple aspects
through weighted factors and further improve computational complexity by
developing a fast approximation algorithm. We demonstrate the feasibility of
the proposed method using the openly available Kaggle shoes competition
dataset. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous
state of the art diversification methods, while reducing computational

accurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this
ranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs
produced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank
algorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable
alternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these
techniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the
extreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the
long/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,
and thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in
Information Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information
embedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query&#x27;s characteristics to
improve ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of
both out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the
original ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer
architecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our
selection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.
Backtesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly
boosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms
and double that of traditional baselines.</span>

are complex or may change during the search, a search engine must adapt the
information delivery as the user&#x27;s information requirements evolve. To support
this dynamic ranking paradigm effectively, search result ranking must
incorporate both the user feedback received, and the information displayed so
far. To address this problem, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based
approach, RLIrank. We first build an adapted reinforcement learning framework
to integrate the key components of the dynamic search. Then, we implement a new
Learning to Rank (LTR) model for each iteration of the dynamic search, using a
recurrent Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), which estimates the
gain for each next result, learning from each previously ranked document. To
incorporate the user&#x27;s feedback, we develop a word-embedding variation of the
classic Rocchio Algorithm, to help guide the ranking towards the high-value
documents. Those innovations enable RLIrank to outperform the previously
reported methods from the TREC Dynamic Domain Tracks 2017 and exceed all the
methods in 2016 TREC Dynamic Domain after multiple search iterations, advancing
the state of the art for dynamic search.</span>

the network structure of social networks. Two large social networks are
analyzed, the first extracted from the Twitter discourse about a big
telecommunication company, and the second obtained from three years of email
communication of 200 managers working for a large multinational company. This
work compares network robustness and the stability of centrality and
interaction metrics, as well as the use of language, after removing spammers
and the most and least connected nodes. The results show that spammers do not
significantly alter the structure of the information-carrying network, for most
of the social indicators. The authors additionally investigate the correlation
between e-mail subject line and content by tracking language sentiment,
emotionality, and complexity, addressing the cases where collecting email
bodies is not permitted for privacy reasons. The findings extend the research
about robustness and stability of social networks metrics, after the
application of graph simplification strategies. The results have practical
implication for network analysts and for those company managers who rely on
network analytics (applied to company emails and social media data) to support
their decision-making processes.</span>

protection in many countries. Currently, twelve countries adopt the regulation
and establish their GDPR-like regulation. However, to evaluate the differences
and similarities of these GDPR-like regulations is time-consuming and needs a
lot of manual effort from legal experts. Moreover, GDPR-like regulations from
different countries are written in their languages leading to a more difficult
task since legal experts who know both languages are essential. In this paper,
we investigate a simple natural language processing (NLP) approach to tackle
the problem. We first extract chunks of information from GDPR-like documents
and form structured data from natural language. Next, we use NLP methods to
compare documents to measure their similarity. Finally, we manually label a
small set of data to evaluate our approach. The empirical result shows that the

                                        <span>Users&#x27; clicks on Web search results are one of the key signals for evaluating
and improving web search quality and have been widely used as part of current
state-of-the-art Learning-To-Rank(LTR) models. With a large volume of search
logs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click
behavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling
the users&#x27; click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.
In particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily
chosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,
especially for lower-ranked results. These kinds of biases in the click log
data can be incorporated into the click models, propagating the errors to the
resulting LTR ranking models or evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose
the De-biased Reinforcement Learning Click model (DRLC). The DRLC model relaxes
previously made assumptions about the users&#x27; examination behavior and resulting
latent states. To implement the DRLC model, convolutional neural networks are
used as the value networks for reinforcement learning, trained to learn a
policy to reduce bias in the click logs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the DRLC model, we first compare performance with the previous state-of-art
approaches using established click prediction metrics, including log-likelihood
and perplexity. We further show that DRLC also leads to improvements in ranking
performance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLC model in
learning to reduce bias in click logs, leading to improved modeling performance
and showing the potential for using DRLC for improving Web search quality.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools and algorithms developed to
alleviate the problem of information overload, which makes it difficult for a
user to make right decisions. Two main paradigms toward the recommendation
problem are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which try to
recommend the best items using ratings and content available. These methods
typically face infamous problems including cold-start, diversity, scalability,
and great computational expense. We argue that the uptake of deep learning and
reinforcement learning methods is also questionable due to their computational
complexities and uninterpretability. In this paper, we approach the
recommendation problem from a new prospective. We borrow ideas from cluster
head selection algorithms in wireless sensor networks and adapt them to the
recommendation problem. In particular, we propose Load Balanced Recommender
System (LBRS), which uses a probabilistic scheme for item recommendation.
Furthermore, we factor in the importance of items in the recommendation
process, which significantly improves the recommendation accuracy. We also
introduce a method that considers a heterogeneity among items, in order to
balance the similarity and diversity trade-off. Finally, we propose a new
metric for diversity, which emphasizes the importance of diversity not only
from an intra-list perspective, but also from a between-list point of view.
With experiments in a simulation study performed on RecSim, we show that LBRS
is effective and can outperform baseline methods.</span>

original query, diversity, click probability etc. One or many rankers may be
trained to score each suggestion from a candidate pool based on these factors.
These scorers are usually pairwise classification tasks where each training
example consists of a user query and a single suggestion from the list of

                                        <span>Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the
complex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation,
and self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn
a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose
to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud
observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer
which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn
a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous
learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its
particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is
invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily
visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we
deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model
can successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.

for storing and inverting large matrices, to achieve efficient usage of
memories. However, the existing low-memory BLS implementation sacrifices the
testing accuracy as a price for efficient usage of memories, since it can no
longer obtain the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the output weights
during incremental learning, and it cannot work under the very small ridge
parameter that is utilized in the original BLS. Accordingly, it is required to
develop the low-memory BLS implementations, which can work under very small
ridge parameters and compute the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the
output weights in the process of incremental learning. In this paper, firstly
we propose the low-memory implementations for the recently proposed recursive
and square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and the recently proposed
squareroot BLS algorithm on added nodes, by simply processing a batch of inputs
or nodes in each recursion. Since the recursive BLS implementation includes the
recursive updates of the inverse matrix that may introduce numerical
instabilities after a large number of iterations, and needs the extra
computational load to decompose the inverse matrix into the Cholesky factor
when cooperating with the proposed low-memory implementation of the square-root
BLS algorithm on added nodes, we only improve the low-memory implementations of
the square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and nodes, to propose the full
lowmemory implementation of the square-root BLS algorithm. All the proposed
low-memory BLS implementations compute the ridge solution for the output
weights in the process of incremental learning, and most of them can work under
very small ridge parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent predictive accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models that allow for making probabilistic predictions.
However, existing latent Gaussian models usually assume either a zero or a
linear prior mean function which can be an unrealistic assumption. This article
introduces a novel approach that combines boosting and latent Gaussian models
in order to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and to leverage the advantages
of both techniques. We obtain increased predictive accuracy compared to
existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data experiments.</span>

retrieval, i.e., retrieving relevant images from a large and unlabelled dataset
given textual queries. In this paper, we propose VisualSparta, a novel
(Visual-text Sparse Transformer Matching) model that shows significant
improvement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. VisualSparta is capable
of outperforming previous state-of-the-art scalable methods in MSCOCO and
Flickr30K. We also show that it achieves substantial retrieving speed
advantages, i.e., for a 1 million image index, VisualSparta using CPU gets
~391X speedup compared to CPU vector search and ~5.4X speedup compared to
vector search with GPU acceleration. Experiments show that this speed advantage
even gets bigger for larger datasets because VisualSparta can be efficiently
implemented as an inverted index. To the best of our knowledge, VisualSparta is
the first transformer-based text-to-image retrieval model that can achieve
real-time searching for large-scale datasets, with significant accuracy
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale
neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this
recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the
challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by
summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and
motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically
representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for
popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges
and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the
landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate
additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper

                                        <span>The increasing complexity of algorithms for analyzing medical data, including
de-identification tasks, raises the possibility that complex algorithms are
learning not just the general representation of the problem, but specifics of
given individuals within the data. Modern legal frameworks specifically
prohibit the intentional or accidental distribution of patient data, but have
not addressed this potential avenue for leakage of such protected health
information. Modern deep learning algorithms have the highest potential of such
leakage due to complexity of the models. Recent research in the field has
highlighted such issues in non-medical data, but all analysis is likely to be
data and algorithm specific. We, therefore, chose to analyze a state-of-the-art
free-text de-identification algorithm based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
and its potential in encoding any individual in the training set. Using the
i2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the
output of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be
used to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used
different attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the
model. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of
the training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model
output. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into
the identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not
yet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional federated learning directly averages model weights, which is
only possible for collaboration between models with homogeneous architectures.
Sharing prediction instead of weight removes this obstacle and eliminates the
risk of white-box inference attacks in conventional federated learning.
However, the predictions from local models are sensitive and would leak
training data privacy to the public. To address this issue, one naive approach
is adding the differentially private random noise to the predictions, which
however brings a substantial trade-off between privacy budget and model
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FEDMD-NFDP,
which applies a Noise-Free Differential Privacy (NFDP) mechanism into a
federated model distillation framework. Our extensive experimental results on
various datasets validate that FEDMD-NFDP can deliver not only comparable
utility and communication efficiency but also provide a noise-free differential
privacy guarantee. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our FEDMD-NFDP by
considering both IID and non-IID setting, heterogeneous model architectures,
and unlabelled public datasets from a different distribution.</span>

non-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex
relationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest
because of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular,
there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing
convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally
referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on
graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial
convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the
graph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in
investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea
of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to
maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural
networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt
the behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial
convolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically
generated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining
relations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of

                                        <span>Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI
in recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction
from undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large
datasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a
matching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this
limitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on
fully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image
prior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during
inference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional
architectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and
randomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these
limitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method
based on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a
deep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise
and latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a
high-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot
reconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is
performed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to
ensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on
brain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER
against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.</span>

                                        <span>Massive multiple-input multiple-output can obtain more performance gain by
exploiting the downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station
(BS). Therefore, studying CSI feedback with limited communication resources in
frequency-division duplexing systems is of great importance. Recently, deep
learning (DL)-based CSI feedback has shown considerable potential. However, the
existing DL-based explicit feedback schemes are difficult to deploy because
current fifth-generation mobile communication protocols and systems are
designed based on an implicit feedback mechanism. In this paper, we propose a
DL-based implicit feedback architecture to inherit the low-overhead
characteristic, which uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the precoding
matrix indicator (PMI) encoding and decoding modules. By using environment
information, the NNs can achieve a more refined mapping between the precoding
matrix and the PMI compared with codebooks. The correlation between subbands is
also used to further improve the feedback performance. Simulation results show
that, for a single resource block (RB), the proposed architecture can save
25.0% and 40.0% of overhead compared with Type I codebook under two antenna

                                        <span>This work studies the statistical limits of uniform convergence for offline
policy evaluation (OPE) problems with model-based methods (for finite horizon
MDP) and provides a unified view towards optimal learning for several
well-motivated offline tasks. Uniform OPE
$\sup_\Pi|Q^\pi-\hat{Q}^\pi|&lt;\epsilon$ (initiated by \citet{yin2021near}) is a
stronger measure than the point-wise (fixed policy) OPE and ensures offline
policy learning when $\Pi$ contains all policies (global policy class). In this
paper, we establish an $\Omega(H^2 S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ lower bound (over
model-based family) for the global uniform OPE, where $d_m$ is the minimal
state-action probability induced by the behavior policy. Next, our main result
establishes an episode complexity of $\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ for
\emph{local} uniform convergence that applies to all \emph{near-empirically
optimal} policies for the MDPs with \emph{stationary} transition. This result
implies the optimal sample complexity for offline learning and separates the
local uniform OPE from the global case due to the extra $S$ factor.
Paramountly, the model-based method combining with our new analysis technique
(singleton absorbing MDP) can be adapted to the new settings: offline
task-agnostic and the offline reward-free with optimal complexity
$\tilde{O}(H^2\log(K)/d_m\epsilon^2)$ ($K$ is the number of tasks) and
$\tilde{O}(H^2S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ respectively, which provides a unified
framework for simultaneously solving different offline RL problems.</span>

treatment and outcome in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The treatment

a negative control treatment (which has no effect on the actual outcome), and a
negative control outcome (which is not affected by the actual treatment). These

nonparametric treatment effects with negative controls. Examples include dose

heterogeneous treatment effects. Data may be discrete or continuous, and low,
high, or infinite dimensional. I prove uniform consistency and provide finite

mention the artifacts removal for EEG signal and then introduce deep learning
models that have been utilized in EEG processing and classification.
Subsequently, the applications of deep learning in EEG are reviewed by
categorizing them into groups such as brain-computer interface, disease
detection, and emotion recognition. They are followed by the discussion, in
which the pros and cons of deep learning are presented and future directions
and challenges for deep learning in EEG are proposed. We hope that this paper
could serve as a summary of past work for deep learning in EEG and the

                                        <span>In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit
converts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language
realization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large
datasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated
with application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from
custom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the
training set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of
the recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future
bridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical
step is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the
present context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over
annotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the
system. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in
classical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate
a prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a
universal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.</span>

relational algorithms model. This is an algorithm that operates directly on a
relational database without performing a join to convert it to a matrix whose
rows represent the data points. The running time is potentially exponentially
smaller than $N$, the number of data points to be clustered that the relational
database represents.

Few relational algorithms are known and this paper offers techniques for
designing relational algorithms as well as characterizing their limitations. We
show that given two data points as cluster centers, if we cluster points
according to their closest centers, it is NP-Hard to approximate the number of
points in the clusters on a general relational input. This is trivial for
conventional data inputs and this result exemplifies that standard algorithmic
techniques may not be directly applied when designing an efficient relational
algorithm. This paper then introduces a new method that leverages rejection
sampling and the $k$-means++ algorithm to construct an O(1)-approximate k-means

                                        <span>The issue of potential privacy leakage during centralized AI&#x27;s model training
has drawn intensive concern from the public. A Parallel and Distributed
Computing (or PDC) scheme, termed Federated Learning (FL), has emerged as a new
paradigm to cope with the privacy issue by allowing clients to perform model
training locally, without the necessity to upload their personal sensitive
data. In FL, the number of clients could be sufficiently large, but the
bandwidth available for model distribution and re-upload is quite limited,
making it sensible to only involve part of the volunteers to participate in the
training process. The client selection policy is critical to an FL process in
terms of training efficiency, the final model&#x27;s quality as well as fairness. In
this paper, we will model the fairness guaranteed client selection as a
Lyapunov optimization problem and then a C2MAB-based method is proposed for
estimation of the model exchange time between each client and the server, based
on which we design a fairness guaranteed algorithm termed RBCS-F for
problem-solving. The regret of RBCS-F is strictly bounded by a finite constant,
justifying its theoretical feasibility. Barring the theoretical results, more
empirical data can be derived from our real training experiments on public
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series
analysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate
representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often
lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from
previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the
semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized
representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled
representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of
learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored
due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex
temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,
2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable
semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of
individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a
novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,
to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and
disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level
disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group
semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL
vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while
preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL
to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various
real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by

                                        <span>Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head
self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image
patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such
flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can
facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain
shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We
systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments
encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing
convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following
intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe
occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.
(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local
textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to
CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate
shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,
previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape
representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic
segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a
single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high
accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional
and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to
flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention
mechanism.</span>

                                        <span>Constraint-based methods are one of the main approaches for causal structure
learning that are particularly valued as they are asymptotically guaranteed to
find a structure that is Markov equivalent to the causal graph of the system.
On the other hand, they may require an exponentially large number of
conditional independence (CI) tests in the number of variables of the system.
In this paper, we propose a novel recursive constraint-based method for causal
structure learning that significantly reduces the required number of CI tests
compared to the existing literature. The idea of the proposed approach is to
use Markov boundary information to identify a specific variable that can be
removed from the set of variables without affecting the statistical
dependencies among the other variables. Having identified such a variable, we
discover its neighborhood, remove that variable from the set of variables, and
recursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. We further
provide a lower bound on the number of CI tests required by any
constraint-based method. Comparing this lower bound to our achievable bound
demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our experimental results
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both on synthetic
and real-world structures.</span>

                                        <span>Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language
processing (NLP) systems. Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are
typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various
downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the
highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled
data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is
abundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for
Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep
metric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for
learning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training
data. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,
our approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised
pretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments
suggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number
of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data, making
further improvements straightforward. Our code and pretrained models are
publicly available and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed
unseen text.</span>

situations, sheaves can provide a natural framework to analyze how well a
statistical model fits at the local level (that is, on subsets of related

that we propose is suitably general enough to be useful in a range of

                                        <span>Knowledge Graphs (KG) and associated Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models
have recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have
the potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the
drug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can
result in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,
incurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately
influencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a
better understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors
which determine it, is required.

In this study we investigate, over the course of many thousands of
experiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models on two public drug
discovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best overall model or
configuration, instead we take a deeper look at how performance can be affected
by changes in the training setup, choice of hyperparameters, model parameter
initialisation seed and different splits of the datasets. Our results highlight
that these factors have significant impact on performance and can even affect
the ranking of models. Indeed these factors should be reported along with model
architectures to ensure complete reproducibility and fair comparisons of future
work, and we argue this is critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of
KGEs in a biomedical setting. To aid reproducibility of our own work, we
release all experimentation code.</span>

and clients in federated learning (FL). Current sampling approaches in FL are
either biased, or non optimal in terms of server-clients communications and
training stability. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{clustered
sampling} for clients selection. We prove that clustered sampling leads to
better clients representatitivity and to reduced variance of the clients
stochastic aggregation weights in FL. Compatibly with our theory, we provide
two different clustering approaches enabling clients aggregation based on 1)
sample size, and 2) models similarity. Through a series of experiments in
non-iid and unbalanced scenarios, we demonstrate that model aggregation through
clustered sampling consistently leads to better training convergence and
variability when compared to standard sampling approaches. Our approach does
not require any additional operation on the clients side, and can be seamlessly
integrated in standard FL implementations. Finally, clustered sampling is
compatible with existing methods and technologies for privacy enhancement, and
for communication reduction through model compression.</span>

agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so

classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We

accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the
continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop
types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling
&gt;3M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are
compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The
overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop
classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest
accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced
accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed
estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99
(rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here
can underpin the operational delivery of in-season high-resolution based crop
mapping.</span>

                                        <span>Context-aware machine translation models are designed to leverage contextual
information, but often fail to do so. As a result, they inaccurately
disambiguate pronouns and polysemous words that require context for resolution.
In this paper, we ask several questions: What contexts do human translators use
to resolve ambiguous words? Are models paying large amounts of attention to the
same context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these
questions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a
new English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K
translations that professional translators found useful for pronoun
disambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used
to disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the
supporting words. Furthermore, we measure the degree of alignment between the
model&#x27;s attention scores and the supporting context from SCAT, and apply a
guided attention strategy to encourage agreement between the two.</span>

in recent years. With their ability to directly learn the probability
distribution of data, and then sample synthetic realistic data. Many
applications have emerged, using GANs to solve classical problems in machine
learning, such as data augmentation, class unbalance problems, and fair
representation learning. In this paper, we analyze and highlight fairness
concerns of GANs model. In this regard, we show empirically that GANs models
may inherently prefer certain groups during the training process and therefore
they&#x27;re not able to homogeneously generate data from different groups during
the testing phase. Furthermore, we propose solutions to solve this issue by
conditioning the GAN model towards samples&#x27; group or using ensemble method
(boosting) to allow the GAN model to leverage distributed structure of data
during the training phase and generate groups at equal rate during the testing
phase.</span>

is key to monitor the recovery levels. However, traditional stroke
rehabilitation assessment methods (such as the popular clinical assessment) can
be subjective and expensive, and it is also less convenient for patients to
visit clinics in a high frequency. To address this issue, in this work based on
wearable sensing and machine learning techniques, we developed an automated
system that can predict the assessment score in an objective manner. With
wrist-worn sensors, accelerometer data was collected from 59 stroke survivors
in free-living environments for a duration of 8 weeks, and we aim to map the
week-wise accelerometer data (3 days per week) to the assessment score by
developing signal processing and predictive model pipeline. To achieve this, we
proposed two types of new features, which can encode the rehabilitation
information from both paralysed/non-paralysed sides while suppressing the
high-level noises such as irrelevant daily activities. Based on the proposed
features, we further developed the longitudinal mixed-effects model with
Gaussian process prior (LMGP), which can model the random effects caused by
different subjects and time slots (during the 8 weeks). Comprehensive
experiments were conducted to evaluate our system on both acute and chronic
patients, and the results suggested its effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) has shown great potential as a privacy-preserving
solution to learning from decentralized data which are only accessible locally
on end devices (i.e., clients). In many scenarios, however, a large proportion
of the clients are probably in possession of low-quality data that are biased,
noisy or even irrelevant. As a result, they could significantly slow down the
convergence of the global model we aim to build and also compromise its
quality. In light of this, we propose FedProf, a novel protocol for optimizing
FL under such circumstances without breaching data privacy. The key of our
approach is using the global model to dynamically profile the latent
representations of data (termed representation footprints) on the clients. By
matching local footprints on clients against a baseline footprint on the
server, we adaptively score each client and adjust its probability of being
selected each round so as to mitigate the impact of the clients with
low-quality data on the training process. We have conducted extensive
experiments on public data sets using various FL settings. The results show
that FedProf effectively reduces the number of communication rounds and overall
time (providing up to 4.5x speedup) for the global model to converge while
improving the accuracy of the final global model.</span>

is high, such as in autonomous vehicle control, medical image analysis,

uncertainty, a supervised reconstruction auto-encoder to capture distributional
uncertainty and using the output of activation functions in the last layer of

from a set of constraints of the form &quot;item $j$ is closer to item $i$ than item
$k$&quot;. Typically, each object is mapped onto a point vector in a low dimensional
metric space. We argue that mapping to a density instead of a point vector
provides some interesting advantages, including an inherent reflection of the
uncertainty about the representation itself and its relative location in the
space. Indeed, in this paper, we propose to embed each object as a Gaussian
distribution. We investigate the ability of these embeddings to capture the
underlying structure of the data while satisfying the constraints, and explore
properties of the representation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets showcase the advantages of our approach. In addition, we illustrate
the merit of modelling uncertainty, which enriches the visual perception of the

                                        <span>Random Forest (RFs) are among the most widely used Machine Learning (ML)
classifiers. Even though RFs are not interpretable, there are no dedicated
non-heuristic approaches for computing explanations of RFs. Moreover, there is
recent work on polynomial algorithms for explaining ML models, including naive
Bayes classifiers. Hence, one question is whether finding explanations of RFs
can be solved in polynomial time. This paper answers this question negatively,
by proving that computing one PI-explanation of an RF is D^P-complete.
Furthermore, the paper proposes a propositional encoding for computing
explanations of RFs, thus enabling finding PI-explanations with a SAT solver.
This contrasts with earlier work on explaining boosted trees (BTs) and neural
networks (NNs), which requires encodings based on SMT/MILP. Experimental
results, obtained on a wide range of publicly available datasets, demontrate
that the proposed SAT-based approach scales to RFs of sizes common in practical
applications. Perhaps more importantly, the experimental results demonstrate
that, for the vast majority of examples considered, the SAT-based approach
proposed in this paper significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches.</span>

                                        <span>In the race to bring Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the edge, collaborative
intelligence has emerged as a promising way to lighten the computation load on
edge devices that run applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Typically, a deep model is split at a certain layer into edge and cloud
sub-models. The deep feature tensor produced by the edge sub-model is
transmitted to the cloud, where the remaining computationally intensive
workload is performed by the cloud sub-model. The communication channel between
the edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep
feature tensor received at the cloud side. In this study, we examine the
effectiveness of four low-rank tensor completion methods in recovering missing
data in the deep feature tensor. We consider both sparse tensors, such as those
produced by the VGG16 model, as well as non-sparse tensors, such as those
produced by ResNet34 model. We study tensor completion effectiveness in both
conplexity-constrained and unconstrained scenario.</span>

                                        <span>In this work we study the problem of measuring the fairness of a machine
learning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we
investigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires
controlling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical
setting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group
information, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more
of these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a
proxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed
to provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in
this work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a
theoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which
accurate fairness evaluation is possible.

Furthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples
them into two interpretable parts $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. The first part
$\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and
recall, whereas the second part $\epsilon$ captures correlations between all
the variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the
estimates is dominated by $\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the
dependence on the correlations $\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.
As a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model
fairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via
simulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated
estimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,
is key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical
results.</span>

                                        <span>Single-Image Super Resolution (SISR) is a classical computer vision problem
and it has been studied for over decades. With the recent success of deep
learning methods, recent work on SISR focuses solutions with deep learning
methodologies and achieves state-of-the-art results. However most of the
state-of-the-art SISR methods contain millions of parameters and layers, which
limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a hardware
(Synaptics Dolphin NPU) limitation aware, extremely lightweight quantization
robust real-time super resolution network (XLSR). The proposed model&#x27;s building
block is inspired from root modules for Image classification. We successfully
applied root modules to SISR problem, further more to make the model uint8
quantization robust we used Clipped ReLU at the last layer of the network and
achieved great balance between reconstruction quality and runtime. Furthermore,
although the proposed network contains 30x fewer parameters than VDSR its
performance surpasses it on Div2K validation set. The network proved itself by
winning Mobile AI 2021 Real-Time Single Image Super Resolution Challenge.</span>

technique on some simple event topologies are able to reproduce standard event

algorithm is based around a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Point-Net
inspired encoder and decoder architecture trained on Human point-cloud data
obtained from the CEASAR dataset. The learned latent space is then clustered to
identify a specified number of sizing groups. We demonstrate this technique on

various black-box explanations, logical reasoning approaches, and

probabilistic sufficient explanations, which formulate explaining an instance
of classification as choosing the &quot;simplest&quot; subset of features such that only
observing those features is &quot;sufficient&quot; to explain the classification. That
is, sufficient to give us strong probabilistic guarantees that the model will
behave similarly when all features are observed under the data distribution. In
addition, we leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning tools such as
probabilistic circuits and expected predictions to design a scalable algorithm
for finding the desired explanations while keeping the guarantees intact. Our

multi-manifold Representation Learning (DCRL) that preserves the geometric
structure of data. In the proposed framework, manifold clustering is done in
the latent space guided by a clustering loss. To overcome the problem that
clustering-oriented losses may deteriorate the geometric structure of
embeddings in the latent space, an isometric loss is proposed for preserving
intra-manifold structure locally and a ranking loss for inter-manifold
structure globally. Experimental results on various datasets show that DCRL
leads to performances comparable to current state-of-the-art deep clustering
algorithms, yet exhibits superior performance for manifold representation. Our
results also demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the proposed
losses in preserving geometric structure in terms of visualization and
performance metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Our life is getting filled by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These devices
often rely on closed or poorly documented protocols, with unknown formats and
semantics. Learning how to interact with such devices in an autonomous manner
is the key for interoperability and automatic verification of their
capabilities. In this paper, we propose RL-IoT, a system that explores how to
automatically interact with possibly unknown IoT devices. We leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) to recover the semantics of protocol messages and
to take control of the device to reach a given goal, while minimizing the
number of interactions. We assume to know only a database of possible IoT
protocol messages, whose semantics are however unknown. RL-IoT exchanges
messages with the target IoT device, learning those commands that are useful to
reach the given goal. Our results show that RL-IoT is able to solve both simple
and complex tasks. With properly tuned parameters, RL-IoT learns how to perform
actions with the target device, a Yeelight smart bulb in our case study,
completing non-trivial patterns with as few as 400 interactions. RL-IoT paves
the road for automatic interactions with poorly documented IoT protocols, thus
enabling interoperable systems.</span>

yields optimal predictions among linear averages. We show that stacking is most
effective when model predictive performance is heterogeneous in inputs, and we
can further improve the stacked mixture with a hierarchical model. We
generalize stacking to Bayesian hierarchical stacking. The model weights are
varying as a function of data, partially-pooled, and inferred using Bayesian
inference. We further incorporate discrete and continuous inputs, other

                                        <span>The computational cost of usual Monte Carlo methods for sampling a posteriori
laws in Bayesian inference scales linearly with the number of data points. One
option to reduce it to a fraction of this cost is to resort to mini-batching in
conjunction with unadjusted discretizations of Langevin dynamics, in which case
only a random fraction of the data is used to estimate the gradient. However,
this leads to an additional noise in the dynamics and hence a bias on the
invariant measure which is sampled by the Markov chain. We advocate using the
so-called Adaptive Langevin dynamics, which is a modification of standard
inertial Langevin dynamics with a dynamical friction which automatically
corrects for the increased noise arising from mini-batching. We investigate the
practical relevance of the assumptions underpinning Adaptive Langevin (constant
covariance for the estimation of the gradient), which are not satisfied in
typical models of Bayesian inference; and show how to extend the approach to
more general situations.</span>

                                        <span>In real world settings, numerous constraints are present which are hard to
specify mathematically. However, for the real world deployment of reinforcement
learning (RL), it is critical that RL agents are aware of these constraints, so
that they can act safely. In this work, we consider the problem of learning
constraints from demonstrations of a constraint-abiding agent&#x27;s behavior. We
experimentally validate our approach and show that our framework can
successfully learn the most likely constraints that the agent respects. We
further show that these learned constraints are \textit{transferable} to new
agents that may have different morphologies and/or reward functions. Previous
works in this regard have either mainly been restricted to tabular (discrete)
settings, specific types of constraints or assume the environment&#x27;s transition
dynamics. In contrast, our framework is able to learn arbitrary
\textit{Markovian} constraints in high-dimensions in a completely model-free
setting. The code can be found it:

                                        <span>The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet
have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing
datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap
between a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting
problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same
task on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal
knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to
effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to
traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be
lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student
model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its
teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify
this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised
learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand
the denoising capability of a multimodal student.</span>

square window, built upon a single realization of a stationary, ergodic point
process observed in this window. Inspired by recent advances in gradient
descent methods for maximum entropy models, we propose a method to generate
similar point patterns by jointly moving particles of an initial Poisson
configuration towards a target counting measure. The target measure is
generated via a deterministic gradient descent algorithm, so as to match a set
of statistics of the given, observed realization. Our statistics are estimators
of the multi-scale wavelet phase harmonic covariance, recently proposed in
image modeling. They allow one to capture geometric structures through
multi-scale interactions between wavelet coefficients. Both our statistics and
the gradient descent algorithm scale better with the number of observed points
than the classical k-nearest neighbour distances previously used in generative
models for point processes, based on the rejection sampling or
simulated-annealing. The overall quality of our model is evaluated on point
processes with various geometric structures through spectral and topological
data analysis.</span>

of oxygen and nutrients to the surrounding cells. Various diseases have been
shown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of
erythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have
been assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a 20-second
long microvascular video takes on average 20 minutes and requires extensive
training. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders the
application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this paper,
we present a fully automated system, called CapillaryNet, that can automate
microvascular microscopy analysis so it can be used as a clinical application.
Moreover, CapillaryNet measures several microvascular parameters that
researchers were previously unable to quantify, i.e. capillary hematocrit and
intra-capillary flow velocity heterogeneity.</span>

the reward functions can be seen as finite transducers. We study reinforcement
learning in regular decision processes. Our main contribution is to show that a
near-optimal policy can be PAC-learned in polynomial time in a set of
parameters that describe the underlying decision process. We argue that the
identified set of parameters is minimal and it reasonably captures the
difficulty of a regular decision process.</span>

                                        <span>Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a powerful framework for tackling the
sparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. However,
the most popular inference algorithms for SBL become too expensive for
high-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large covariance
matrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new SBL inference algorithm that
avoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix, thereby saving
significant time and space. Instead of performing costly matrix inversions, our
covariance-free method solves multiple linear systems to obtain provably
unbiased estimates of the posterior statistics needed by SBL. These systems can
be solved in parallel, enabling further acceleration of the algorithm via
graphics processing units. In practice, our method can be up to thousands of
times faster than existing baselines, reducing hours of computation time to
seconds. We showcase how our new algorithm enables SBL to tractably tackle
high-dimensional signal recovery problems, such as deconvolution of calcium
imaging data and multi-contrast reconstruction of magnetic resonance images.
Finally, we open-source a toolbox containing all of our implementations to
drive future research in SBL.</span>

                                        <span>First-person object-interaction tasks in high-fidelity, 3D, simulated
environments such as the AI2Thor virtual home-environment pose significant
sample-efficiency challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents learning
from sparse task rewards. To alleviate these challenges, prior work has
provided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping,
ground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we
show that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without
supervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during
task learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is
that learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward
prediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation
learning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster
policy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our
agent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the
AI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to
strong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents
with alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with
ground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model
best closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum
success rate. Additionally, we find that incorporating object-attention into an
object-model&#x27;s forward predictions is key to learning representations which
capture object-category and object-state.</span>

                                        <span>This paper studies the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning of
ergodic It\^o diffusions. The objective is to understand the convergence
properties of the invariant statistics when the underlying system of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) is empirically estimated with a supervised
regression framework. Using the perturbation theory of ergodic Markov chains
and the linear response theory, we deduce a linear dependence of the errors of
one-point and two-point invariant statistics on the error in the learning of
the drift and diffusion coefficients. More importantly, our study shows that
the usual $L^2$-norm characterization of the learning generalization error is
insufficient for achieving this linear dependence result. We find that
sufficient conditions for such a linear dependence result are through learning
algorithms that produce a uniformly Lipschitz and consistent estimator in the
hypothesis space that retains certain characteristics of the drift
coefficients, such as the usual linear growth condition that guarantees the
existence of solutions of the underlying SDEs. We examine these conditions on
two well-understood learning algorithms: the kernel-based spectral regression
method and the shallow random neural networks with the ReLU activation
function.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, there has been substantial progress in image synthesis from
semantic labelmaps. However, methods used for this task assume the availability
of complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and
class labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs
restricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world
applications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.
On the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps
or sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and
artists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few
objects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from
sparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\% of
object instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a
two-stage deep network based method, called &#x60;Halluci-Net&#x27;, that learns
co-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these
relationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense
labelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis
techniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is
evaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on
performance metrics like Fr\&#x27;echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic
segmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences. We also show
qualitative results on a subset of ADE20K dataset that contains bedroom images.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we consider hybrid parallelism -- a paradigm that employs both
Data Parallelism (DP) and Model Parallelism (MP) -- to scale distributed
training of large recommendation models. We propose a compression framework
called Dynamic Communication Thresholding (DCT) for communication-efficient
hybrid training. DCT filters the entities to be communicated across the network
through a simple hard-thresholding function, allowing only the most relevant
information to pass through. For communication efficient DP, DCT compresses the
parameter gradients sent to the parameter server during model synchronization.
The threshold is updated only once every few thousand iterations to reduce the
computational overhead of compression. For communication efficient MP, DCT
incorporates a novel technique to compress the activations and gradients sent
across the network during the forward and backward propagation, respectively.
This is done by identifying and updating only the most relevant neurons of the
neural network for each training sample in the data. We evaluate DCT on
publicly available natural language processing and recommender models and
datasets, as well as recommendation systems used in production at Facebook. DCT
reduces communication by at least $100\times$ and $20\times$ during DP and MP,
respectively. The algorithm has been deployed in production, and it improves
end-to-end training time for a state-of-the-art industrial recommender model by
37\%, without any loss in performance.</span>

objective functions, which have multiple local minima. The same problem is
often found in physical simulations and may be resolved by the methods of
Langevin dynamics with Simulated Annealing, which is a well-established
approach for minimization of many-particle potentials. This analogy provides
useful insights for non-convex stochastic optimization in machine learning.
Here we find that integration of the discretized Langevin equation gives a
coordinate updating rule equivalent to the famous Momentum optimization
algorithm. As a main result, we show that a gradual decrease of the momentum
coefficient from the initial value close to unity until zero is equivalent to
application of Simulated Annealing or slow cooling, in physical terms. Making
use of this novel approach, we propose CoolMomentum -- a new stochastic
optimization method. Applying Coolmomentum to optimization of Resnet-20 on
Cifar-10 dataset and Efficientnet-B0 on Imagenet, we demonstrate that it is

and we aim to maximize the overall utility while the expected cumulative
resource consumption $\sum_{t&#x3D;1}^T \langle p,x_t\rangle$ is below a fixed
budget $B_T$. Stochastic long-term constraints arise naturally in applications
where there is a limited budget or resource available and resource consumption
at each step is governed by stochastically time-varying environments. We
propose the Online Lagrangian Frank-Wolfe (OLFW) algorithm to solve this class
of online problems. We analyze the performance of the OLFW algorithm and we
obtain sub-linear regret bounds as well as sub-linear cumulative constraint
violation bounds, both in expectation and with high probability.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of
a deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which
randomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard
distributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more
informed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where
each layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is
cast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and
decoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a
user-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into
the well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free
solutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to
random initialization methods, both before start of training and after training
is over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot
and fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time
complexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition
performance.</span>

CVPR. These defenses are mainly focused on mitigating white-box attacks. They
do not properly examine black-box attacks. In this paper, we expand upon the
analysis of these defenses to include adaptive black-box adversaries. Our
evaluation is done on nine defenses including Barrage of Random Transforms,
ComDefend, Ensemble Diversity, Feature Distillation, The Odds are Odd, Error
Correcting Codes, Distribution Classifier Defense, K-Winner Take All and Buffer
Zones. Our investigation is done using two black-box adversarial models and six
widely studied adversarial attacks for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our
analyses show most recent defenses (7 out of 9) provide only marginal
improvements in security ($&lt;25\%$), as compared to undefended networks. For
every defense, we also show the relationship between the amount of data the
adversary has at their disposal, and the effectiveness of adaptive black-box
attacks. Overall, our results paint a clear picture: defenses need both
thorough white-box and black-box analyses to be considered secure. We provide
this large scale study and analyses to motivate the field to move towards the
development of more robust black-box defenses.</span>

a principled probabilistic approach to modelling input-dependent, also known as
heteroscedastic, label noise in these datasets. We place a multivariate Normal
distributed latent variable on the final hidden layer of a neural network
classifier. The covariance matrix of this latent variable, models the aleatoric
uncertainty due to label noise. We demonstrate that the learned covariance
structure captures known sources of label noise between semantically similar

other baselines, we show significantly improved accuracy on Imagenet ILSVRC
2012 79.3% (+2.6%), Imagenet-21k 47.0% (+1.1%) and JFT 64.7% (+1.6%). We set a

                                        <span>Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential for the diagnosis of epilepsy, but
it requires expertise and experience to identify abnormalities. It is thus
crucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormal EEGs related
to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of compact
and efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal time
intervals and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired
by a CNN developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet
(mEEGNet). Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number
of electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormalities. The mEEGNet was
evaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and
childhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given
to paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and
interictal (nonseizure) intervals. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected
abnormal EEGs with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity
equivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of
parameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset
of absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is
the largest in the literature.</span>

                                        <span>Train machine learning models on sensitive user data has raised increasing
privacy concerns in many areas. Federated learning is a popular approach for
privacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of real
data. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local
differential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not
give a practical solution due to three issues. First, the noisy data is close
to its original value with high probability, increasing the risk of information
exposure. Second, a large variance is introduced to the estimated average,
causing poor accuracy. Last, the privacy budget explodes due to the high
dimensionality of weights in deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a
novel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to
address the abovementioned issues. It is capable of making the data more
distinct from its original value and introducing lower variance. Moreover, the
proposed mechanism bypasses the curse of dimensionality by splitting and
shuffling model updates. A series of empirical evaluations on three commonly
used datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our solution
can not only achieve superior deep learning performance but also provide a
strong privacy guarantee at the same time.</span>

                                        <span>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect phishing emails is
primarily dependent on large-scale centralized datasets, which opens it up to a
myriad of privacy, trust, and legal issues. Moreover, organizations are loathed
to share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive
information. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global
AI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and
collaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a
desideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain
regarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within
the context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge,
the work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email
anti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly
RNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled
learning performance under various settings, including balanced and
asymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance
statistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for
balanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a
variation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed
total email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop
when increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy
rises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow
increasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations
in the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by
achieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global
model performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of generative models with
two antagonistic neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. These two
neural networks compete against each other through an adversarial process that
can be modeled as a stochastic Nash equilibrium problem. Since the associated
training process is challenging, it is fundamental to design reliable
algorithms to compute an equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a stochastic
relaxed forward-backward (SRFB) algorithm for GANs and we show convergence to
an exact solution when an increasing number of data is available. We also show
convergence of an averaged variant of the SRFB algorithm to a neighborhood of
the solution when only few samples are available. In both cases, convergence is
guaranteed when the pseudogradient mapping of the game is monotone. This
assumption is among the weakest known in the literature. Moreover, we apply our
algorithm to the image generation problem.</span>

                                        <span>Sparse rewards are double-edged training signals in reinforcement learning:
easy to design but hard to optimize. Intrinsic motivation guidances have thus
been developed toward alleviating the resulting exploration problem. They
usually incentivize agents to look for new states through novelty signals. Yet,
such methods encourage exhaustive exploration of the state space rather than
focusing on the environment&#x27;s salient interaction opportunities. We propose a
new exploration method, called Don&#x27;t Do What Doesn&#x27;t Matter (DoWhaM), shifting
the emphasis from state novelty to state with relevant actions. While most
actions consistently change the state when used, \textit{e.g.} moving the
agent, some actions are only effective in specific states, \textit{e.g.},
\emph{opening} a door, \emph{grabbing} an object. DoWhaM detects and rewards
actions that seldom affect the environment. We evaluate DoWhaM on the
procedurally-generated environment MiniGrid, against state-of-the-art methods
and show that DoWhaM greatly reduces sample complexity.</span>

induce noise into video feeds. We observe that popular unsupervised MOT methods
are dependent on noise-free conditions. We show that the addition of a small
amount of artificial random noise causes a sharp degradation in model
performance on benchmark metrics. We resolve this problem by introducing a
robust unsupervised multi-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net. The proposed
single-head attention model helps limit the negative impact of noise by
learning visual representations at different segment scales. AttU-Net shows
better unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based
state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate our method in the MNIST and the Atari

complex visual patterns that include Kuzushiji characters and fashion images to

interpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data
compression and discriminative representation. We show that for
high-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative
representation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset
and the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient
ascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a
multi-layer deep network, named ReduNet, that shares common characteristics of
modern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear
operators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed
layer-by-layer via forward propagation, instead of learned via back
propagation. All components of so-obtained &quot;white-box&quot; network have precise
optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear
operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions
when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation
also indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more
efficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary
simulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate
reduction objective and the associated ReduNet. All code and data are available

                                        <span>In intelligent transportation system, the key problem of traffic forecasting
is how to extract the periodic temporal dependencies and complex spatial
correlation. Current state-of-the-art methods for traffic flow prediction are
based on graph architectures and sequence learning models, but they do not
fully exploit spatial-temporal dynamic information in traffic system.
Specifically, the temporal dependence of short-range is diluted by recurrent
neural networks, and existing sequence model ignores local spatial information
because the convolution operation uses global average pooling. Besides, there
will be some traffic accidents during the transitions of objects causing
congestion in the real world that trigger increased prediction deviation. To
overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Conv-sequence
Learning (STCL), in which a focused temporal block uses unidirectional
convolution to effectively capture short-term periodic temporal dependence, and
a spatial-temporal fusion module is able to extract the dependencies of both
interactions and decrease the feature dimensions. Moreover, the accidents
features impact on local traffic congestion and position encoding is employed
to detect anomalies in complex traffic situations. We conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale real-world tasks and verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method.</span>

very deep architecture where each stacked processing block is derived from a
time-invariant non-autonomous dynamical system. Non-autonomy is implemented by
skip connections from the block input to each of the unrolled processing stages
and allows stability to be enforced so that blocks can be unrolled adaptively
to a pattern-dependent processing depth. NAIS-Net induces non-trivial,
Lipschitz input-output maps, even for an infinite unroll length. We prove that
the network is globally asymptotically stable so that for every initial
condition there is exactly one input-dependent equilibrium assuming $tanh$
units, and incrementally stable for ReL units. An efficient implementation that
enforces the stability under derived conditions for both fully-connected and
convolutional layers is also presented. Experimental results show how NAIS-Net

(PSGD) are scalable algorithms to compute model parameters in unconstrained and
constrained optimization problems. In comparison with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), PSGD forces its iterative values into the constrained parameter
space via projection. The convergence rate of PSGD-type estimates has been
exhaustedly studied, while statistical properties such as asymptotic
distribution remain less explored. From a purely statistical point of view,
this paper studies the limiting distribution of PSGD-based estimate when the
true parameters satisfying some linear-equality constraints. Our theoretical
findings reveal the role of projection played in the uncertainty of the PSGD

test the linear-equality constraints. Simulation studies on synthetic data and
an application to a real-world dataset confirm our theory.</span>

learning systems in order to improve explainability. The complexity of machine
learning models has elicited research to make them more explainable. However,
most explainability methods cannot provide insight beyond the given data,
requiring additional information about the context. We propose to harness prior
knowledge to improve upon the explanation capabilities of machine learning
models. In this paper, we present a categorization of current research into
three main categories which either integrate knowledge into the machine
learning pipeline, into the explainability method or derive knowledge from
explanations. To classify the papers, we build upon the existing taxonomy of
informed machine learning and extend it from the perspective of explainability.
We conclude with open challenges and research directions.</span>

                                        <span>Matrix completion has attracted a lot of attention in many fields including
statistics, applied mathematics and electrical engineering. Most of works focus
on the independent sampling models under which the individual observed entries
are sampled independently. Motivated by applications in the integration of
multiple (point-wise mutual information) PMI matrices, we propose the model
{\bf B}lockwise missing {\bf E}mbedding {\bf L}earning {\bf T}ransformer (BELT)
to treat row-wise/column-wise missingness. Specifically, our proposed method
aims at efficient matrix recovery when every pair of matrices from multiple
sources has an overlap. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed
BELT method. Simulation studies show that the method performs well in finite
sample under a variety of configurations. The method is applied to integrate
several PMI matrices built by EHR data and Chinese medical text data, which
enables us to construct a comprehensive embedding set for CUI and Chinese with
high quality.</span>

                                        <span>Automated unit test case generation tools facilitate test-driven development
and support developers by suggesting tests intended to identify flaws in their
code. Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,
generating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read
or understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to
generate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and
developer-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure
consisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and
supervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit
tests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code
pretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal
method. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with
pretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing
additional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest
publicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and
corresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from
91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five
defects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the
focal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test
coverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite
and GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable
coverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their
preference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing
effectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards
AthenaTest.</span>

propose a new temporal mutual information measure defined on a window-based
representation of time series. We then show how this measure relates to an
entropy reduction principle that can be seen as a special case of the
Probabilistic Raising Principle. We finally combine these two ingredients in a

communication-efficient variants of stochastic gradient descent that can be
deployed to perform parallel model training. One popular
communication-compression method for data-parallel SGD is QSGD (Alistarh et
al., 2017), which quantizes and encodes gradients to reduce communication
costs. The baseline variant of QSGD provides strong theoretical guarantees,
however, for practical purposes, the authors proposed a heuristic variant which
we call QSGDinf, which demonstrated impressive empirical gains for distributed
training of large neural networks. In this paper, we build on this work to
propose a new gradient quantization scheme, and show that it has both stronger
theoretical guarantees than QSGD, and matches and exceeds the empirical
performance of the QSGDinf heuristic and of other compression methods.</span>

techniques applied to a set of $n$ linear measurements of the form
$y_i&#x3D;\boldsymbol{\beta}_\star^{T}{\bf x}_i +n_i$ where
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_\star$ is an unknown vector, $\left\{{\bf

$\left\{{n}_i\right\}_{i&#x3D;1}^n$ model the noise. Particularly, under some
plausible assumptions on the statistical distribution of the data, we
characterize the feasibility condition for the hard support vector regression
in the regime of high dimensions and, when feasible, derive an asymptotic
approximation for its risk. Similarly, we study the test risk for the soft
support vector regression as a function of its parameters. Our results are then
used to optimally tune the parameters intervening in the design of hard and
soft support vector regression algorithms. Based on our analysis, we illustrate
that adding more samples may be harmful to the test performance of support
vector regression, while it is always beneficial when the parameters are
optimally selected. Such a result reminds a similar phenomenon observed in
modern learning architectures according to which optimally tuned architectures
present a decreasing test performance curve with respect to the number of

hyperbolic space so that they agree as well as possible with given constraints
in the form of entity i is more similar to entity j than to entity k. It has
been experimentally shown that HOE can obtain representations of hierarchical
data such as a knowledge base and a citation network effectively, owing to
hyperbolic space&#x27;s exponential growth property. However, its theoretical
analysis has been limited to ideal noiseless settings, and its generalization
error in compensation for hyperbolic space&#x27;s exponential representation ability
has not been guaranteed. The difficulty is that existing generalization error
bound derivations for ordinal embedding based on the Gramian matrix do not work
in HOE, since hyperbolic space is not inner-product space. In this paper,
through our novel characterization of HOE with decomposed Lorentz Gramian
matrices, we provide a generalization error bound of HOE for the first time,
which is at most exponential with respect to the embedding space&#x27;s radius. Our
comparison between the bounds of HOE and Euclidean ordinal embedding shows that
HOE&#x27;s generalization error is reasonable as a cost for its exponential
representation ability.</span>

access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and
devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance
of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious
problem that causes disputes and endangers societal stability and harmony. Fake
news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature.
proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news,
paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to
identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying
to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such
platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at
hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent
of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we
propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of
the news at the early stage i.e. when the news is published but is yet to be
disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with
automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary,
we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the
article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to
obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection. The experiment
conducted on the real-world dataset indicates that our model outperforms the
previous work and enables fake news detection with an accuracy of 95.32%.</span>

suited for finding optimal combinations of things in specific applications
ranging from chemistry all the way to finance. The training of VQAs with
gradient descent optimization algorithm has shown a good convergence. At an
early stage, the simulation of variational quantum circuits on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices suffers from noisy outputs. Just like
classical deep learning, it also suffers from vanishing gradient problems. It
is a realistic goal to study the topology of loss landscape, to visualize the
curvature information and trainability of these circuits in the existence of
vanishing gradients. In this paper, we calculated the Hessian and visualized
the loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in
parameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers
(VQC) is interpreted and the loss function&#x27;s convergence is shown. It helps us
better understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle
optimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum
classifiers via Hessian on quantum computers, started with a simple 4-bit
parity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then
thoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues on training the

                                        <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to create a decision-making agent for
autonomous driving. However, previous approaches provide only black-box
solutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about
its decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of
the agent&#x27;s decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous
driving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)
method, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a
complete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by
learning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric
uncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to
provide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for
classifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also
introduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time
efficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the
estimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained
agent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that
the agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,
potentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.</span>

                                        <span>The need for accurate yield estimates for viticulture is becoming more
important due to increasing competition in the wine market worldwide. One of
the most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can
be approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this
article, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries
with leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that
will enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial
networks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario
behind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded
berries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after
applying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to
applying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local
conditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.
Furthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image
should be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring
information about hidden areas.</span>

                                        <span>The medical domain is often subject to information overload. The digitization
of healthcare, constant updates to online medical repositories, and increasing
availability of biomedical datasets make it challenging to effectively analyze
the data. This creates additional work for medical professionals who are
heavily dependent on medical data to complete their research and consult their
patients. This paper aims to show how different text highlighting techniques
can capture relevant medical context. This would reduce the doctors&#x27; cognitive
load and response time to patients by facilitating them in making faster
decisions, thus improving the overall quality of online medical services. Three
different word-level text highlighting methodologies are implemented and
evaluated. The first method uses TF-IDF scores directly to highlight important
parts of the text. The second method is a combination of TF-IDF scores and the
application of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to
classification models. The third method uses neural networks directly to make
predictions on whether or not a word should be highlighted. The results of our
experiments show that the neural network approach is successful in highlighting
medically-relevant terms and its performance is improved as the size of the
input segment increases.</span>

paths represent causal pathways between the corresponding variables. The
variable at the beginning of such a path is referred to as an ancestor of the
variable at the end of the path. Ancestral relations between variables play an
important role in causal modeling. In existing literature on structure
learning, these relations are usually deduced from learned structures and used
for orienting edges or formulating constraints of the space of possible DAGs.
However, they are usually not posed as immediate target of inference. In this
work we investigate the graphical characterization of ancestral relations via
CPDAGs and d-separation relations. We propose a framework that can learn
definite non-ancestral relations without first learning the skeleton. This
frame-work yields structural information that can be used in both score- and
constraint-based algorithms to learn causal DAGs more efficiently.</span>

surrogate Computer Aided Design (CAD) models are able to detect and classify
real-world artefacts from photographs. The applications of which support
twinning of digital and physical assets in design, including rapid extraction
of part geometry from model repositories, information search \&amp; retrieval and
identifying components in the field for maintenance, repair, and recording. The
performance of CNNs in classification tasks have been shown dependent on
training data set size and number of classes. Where prior works have used
relatively small surrogate model data sets ($&lt;100$ models), the question
remains as to the ability of a CNN to differentiate between models in
increasingly large model repositories. This paper presents a method for
generating synthetic image data sets from online CAD model repositories, and
further investigates the capacity of an off-the-shelf CNN architecture trained
on synthetic data to classify models as class size increases. 1,000 CAD models
were curated and processed to generate large scale surrogate data sets,
featuring model coverage at steps of 10$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$,
and 120$^{\circ}$ degrees. The findings demonstrate the capability of computer
vision algorithms to classify artefacts in model repositories of up to 200,
beyond this point the CNN&#x27;s performance is observed to deteriorate
significantly, limiting its present ability for automated twinning of physical
to digital artefacts. Although, a match is more often found in the top-5
results showing potential for information search and retrieval on large

                                        <span>We show that the popular reinforcement learning (RL) strategy of estimating
the state-action value (Q-function) by minimizing the mean squared Bellman
error leads to a regression problem with confounding, the inputs and output
noise being correlated. Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can
result in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the
target Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of
overcoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not
well understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to
address confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality
literature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the
literature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to
improved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of
recent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the
goal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying
different IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously
proposed OPE methods such as model-based techniques but also to obtain
competitive new techniques. We find empirically that state-of-the-art OPE
methods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM,
which were not developed for OPE. We open-source all our code and datasets at

the world. In many countries, the 2nd wave is very severe. Economical and rapid
testing, as well as diagnosis, is urgently needed to control the pandemic. At
present, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR)
testing can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing
methods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19. Thus,
inspired by the limitations of the open-source work in this field, we propose
attention guided contrastive CNN architecture (AC-CovidNet) for Covid-19
detection in CXR images. The proposed method learns the robust and
discriminative features with the help of contrastive loss. Moreover, the
proposed method gives more importance to the infected regions as guided by the
attention mechanism. We compute the sensitivity of the proposed method over the
publicly available Covid-19 dataset. It is observed that the proposed
AC-CovidNet exhibits very promising performance as compared to the existing
methods even with limited training data. It can tackle the bottleneck of CXR
Covid-19 datasets being faced by the researchers. The code used in this paper

                                        <span>Understanding the impact of data structure on the computational tractability
of learning is a key challenge for the theory of neural networks. Many
theoretical works do not explicitly model training data, or assume that inputs
are drawn component-wise independently from some simple probability
distribution. Here, we go beyond this simple paradigm by studying the
performance of neural networks trained on data drawn from pre-trained
generative models. This is possible due to a Gaussian equivalence stating that
the key metrics of interest, such as the training and test errors, can be fully
captured by an appropriately chosen Gaussian model. We provide three strands of
rigorous, analytical and numerical evidence corroborating this equivalence.
First, we establish rigorous conditions for the Gaussian equivalence to hold in
the case of single-layer generative models, as well as deterministic rates for
convergence in distribution. Second, we leverage this equivalence to derive a
closed set of equations describing the generalisation performance of two widely
studied machine learning problems: two-layer neural networks trained using
one-pass stochastic gradient descent, and full-batch pre-learned features or
kernel methods. Finally, we perform experiments demonstrating how our theory
applies to deep, pre-trained generative models. These results open a viable
path to the theoretical study of machine learning models with realistic data.</span>

                                        <span>Probes are models devised to investigate the encoding of knowledge -- e.g.
syntactic structure -- in contextual representations. Probes are often designed
for simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not
allow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one
such restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe
(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic
structure in contextual representations through learning only linear
transformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are
able to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical
number of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis
function (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a
statistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --
implying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.
We conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT&#x27;s self-attention
layers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe&#x27;s
stronger performance.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient
descent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)
optimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles
the dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still
unable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This
paper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the
direction/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the
literature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its
magnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size
based on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the
optimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate
past gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of
AngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for
computing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits
the same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods
reveal a superior performance of AngularGrad. The source code will be made
publicly available at: https://github.com/mhaut/AngularGrad.</span>

mostly marginal, despite the great efforts of the research community. Moreover,
the robustness evaluation is often imprecise, making it difficult to identify
promising approaches. We analyze the classification decisions of 19 different
state-of-the-art neural networks trained to be robust against adversarial
attacks. Our findings suggest that current untargeted adversarial attacks
induce misclassification towards only a limited amount of different classes.
Additionally, we observe that both over- and under-confidence in model
predictions result in an inaccurate assessment of model robustness. Based on
these observations, we propose a novel loss function for adversarial attacks
that consistently improves attack success rate compared to prior loss functions

                                        <span>Recently, unsupervised parsing of syntactic trees has gained considerable
attention. A prototypical approach to such unsupervised parsing employs
reinforcement learning and auto-encoders. However, no mechanism ensures that
the learnt model leverages the well-understood language grammar. We propose an
approach that utilizes very generic linguistic knowledge of the language
present in the form of syntactic rules, thus inducing better syntactic
structures. We introduce a novel formulation that takes advantage of the
syntactic grammar rules and is independent of the base system. We achieve new

grows with the rising use of the fingerprint for authentication. This work
presents a new approach to single-class classification for software-based
fingerprint presentation attach detection. The described method utilizes a
Wasserstein GAN to apply transfer learning to a deep convolutional autoencoder.
By doing so, the autoencoder could be pretrained and finetuned on the
LivDet2021 Dermalog sensor dataset with only 1122 bona fide training samples.
Without making use of any presentation attack samples, the model could archive
an average classification error rate of 16.79%. The Wasserstein GAN implemented
to pretrain the autoencoders weights can further be used to generate
realistic-looking artificial fingerprint patches. Extensive testing of
different autoencoder architectures and hyperparameters led to coarse
architectural guidelines as well as multiple implementations which can be
utilized for future work.</span>

power consumption of multiple loads, taken from a single smart electrical
meter, into appliance-level details. State-of-the-Art approaches are based on
Machine Learning methods and exploit the fusion of time- and frequency-domain
features from current and voltage sensors. Unfortunately, these methods are
compute-demanding and memory-intensive. Therefore, running low-latency NILM on
low-cost, resource-constrained MCU-based meters is currently an open challenge.
This paper addresses the optimization of the feature spaces as well as the
computational and storage cost reduction needed for executing State-of-the-Art
(SoA) NILM algorithms on memory- and compute-limited MCUs. We compare four
supervised learning techniques on different classification scenarios and
characterize the overall NILM pipeline&#x27;s implementation on a MCU-based Smart
Measurement Node. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the feature
space enables edge MCU-based NILM with 95.15% accuracy, resulting in a small
drop compared to the most-accurate feature vector deployment (96.19%) while
achieving up to 5.45x speed-up and 80.56% storage reduction. Furthermore, we
show that low-latency NILM relying only on current measurements reaches almost
80% accuracy, allowing a major cost reduction by removing voltage sensors from
the hardware design.</span>

                                        <span>Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often
found in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity
in trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is
frequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in
busy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide
substantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending
trauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform
grading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to
enable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering
insights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an
automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist
radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method
operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects
distinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model
that are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical
best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and
finally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures
that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating
point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and
corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides
finding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on
important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system&#x27;s recommendation and
achieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.
Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not
compromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning applications have become ubiquitous. Their applications from
machine embedded control in production over process optimization in diverse
areas (e.g., traffic, finance, sciences) to direct user interactions like
advertising and recommendations. This has led to an increased effort of making
machine learning trustworthy. Explainable and fair AI have already matured.
They address knowledgeable users and application engineers. However, there are
users that want to deploy a learned model in a similar way as their washing
machine. These stakeholders do not want to spend time understanding the model.
Instead, they want to rely on guaranteed properties. What are the relevant
properties? How can they be expressed to stakeholders without presupposing
machine learning knowledge? How can they be guaranteed for a certain
implementation of a model? These questions move far beyond the current
state-of-the-art and we want to address them here. We propose a unified
framework that certifies learning methods via care labels. They are easy to
understand and draw inspiration from well-known certificates like textile
labels or property cards of electronic devices. Our framework considers both,
the machine learning theory and a given implementation. We test the
implementation&#x27;s compliance with theoretical properties and bounds. In this
paper, we illustrate care labels by a prototype implementation of a
certification suite for a selection of probabilistic graphical models.</span>

                                        <span>We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of
physically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial
networks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning
framework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained
in tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to
discriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation
policy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our
GAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately
to imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external
control signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different
policies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following
attractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance
without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly
controls the character without having to track any target reference pose
explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive
policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching
mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of
imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability
to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our
approach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be
easily integrated into interactive applications and games.</span>

accurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this
ranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs
produced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank
algorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable
alternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these
techniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the
extreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the
long/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,
and thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in
Information Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information
embedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query&#x27;s characteristics to
improve ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of
both out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the
original ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer
architecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our
selection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.
Backtesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly
boosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms
and double that of traditional baselines.</span>

Discrepancy (KSD) has received much interest recently. We investigate the
properties of its Wasserstein gradient flow to approximate a target probability
distribution $\pi$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, known up to a normalization constant.
This leads to a straightforwardly implementable, deterministic score-based
method to sample from $\pi$, named KSD Descent, which uses a set of particles
to approximate $\pi$. Remarkably, owing to a tractable loss function, KSD
Descent can leverage robust parameter-free optimization schemes such as L-BFGS;
this contrasts with other popular particle-based schemes such as the Stein
Variational Gradient Descent algorithm. We study the convergence properties of
KSD Descent and demonstrate its practical relevance. However, we also highlight
failure cases by showing that the algorithm can get stuck in spurious local

                                        <span>Deep learning (DL) has achieved unprecedented success in a variety of tasks.
However, DL systems are notoriously difficult to test and debug due to the lack
of explainability of DL models and the huge test input space to cover.
Generally speaking, it is relatively easy to collect a massive amount of test
data, but the labeling cost can be quite high. Consequently, it is essential to
conduct test selection and label only those selected &quot;high quality&quot;
bug-revealing test inputs for test cost reduction.

In this paper, we propose a novel test prioritization technique that brings
order into the unlabeled test instances according to their bug-revealing
capabilities, namely TestRank. Different from existing solutions, TestRank
leverages both intrinsic attributes and contextual attributes of test instances
when prioritizing them. To be specific, we first build a similarity graph on
test instances and training samples, and we conduct graph-based semi-supervised
learning to extract contextual features. Then, for a particular test instance,
the contextual features extracted from the graph neural network (GNN) and the
intrinsic features obtained with the DL model itself are combined to predict
its bug-revealing probability. Finally, TestRank prioritizes unlabeled test
instances in descending order of the above probability value. We evaluate the
performance of TestRank on a variety of image classification datasets.
Experimental results show that the debugging efficiency of our method
significantly outperforms existing test prioritization techniques.</span>

                                        <span>This is a short note on the performance of the ALI-G algorithm (Berrada et
al., 2020) as reported in (Loizou et al., 2021). ALI-G (Berrada et al., 2020)
and SPS (Loizou et al., 2021) are both adaptations of the Polyak step-size to
optimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The
main algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant
in the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,
and (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses
a constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two
works, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In
their experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which
is a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for
e.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the
improved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.
In particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%
(+8%) with a very small amount of tuning. Thus ALI-G remains a very competitive
method for training interpolating neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a prevalent optimization technique for
large-scale distributed machine learning. While SGD computation can be
efficiently divided between multiple machines, communication typically becomes
a bottleneck in the distributed setting. Gradient compression methods can be
used to alleviate this problem, and a recent line of work shows that SGD
augmented with gradient compression converges to an $\varepsilon$-first-order
stationary point. In this paper we extend these results to convergence to an
$\varepsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\varepsilon$-SOSP), which is to
the best of our knowledge the first result of this type. In addition, we show
that, when the stochastic gradient is not Lipschitz, compressed SGD with
RandomK compressor converges to an $\varepsilon$-SOSP with the same number of
iterations as uncompressed SGD [Jin et al.,2021] (JACM), while improving the
total communication by a factor of $\tilde \Theta(\sqrt{d}
\varepsilon^{-3/4})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem.
We present additional results for the cases when the compressor is arbitrary
and when the stochastic gradient is Lipschitz.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine-learning paradigm, in
which a global server iteratively averages the model parameters of local users
without accessing their data. User heterogeneity has imposed significant
challenges to FL, which can incur drifted global models that are slow to
converge. Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by
refining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users,
other than directly averaging their model parameters. This approach, however,
depends on a proxy dataset, making it impractical unless such a prerequisite is
satisfied. Moreover, the ensemble knowledge is not fully utilized to guide
local model learning, which may in turn affect the quality of the aggregated
model. Inspired by the prior art, we propose a data-free knowledge
distillation} approach to address heterogeneous FL, where the server learns a
lightweight generator to ensemble user information in a data-free manner, which
is then broadcasted to users, regulating local training using the learned
knowledge as an inductive bias. Empirical studies powered by theoretical
implications show that, our approach facilitates FL with better generalization
performance using fewer communication rounds, compared with the
state-of-the-art.</span>

compromising predicting ability of a network. Many algorithms have been
developed for pruning both over-parameterized fully-connected networks (FCNs)
and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but analytical studies of
capabilities and compression ratios of such pruned sub-networks are lacking. We
theoretically study the performance of two pruning techniques (random and
magnitude-based) on FCNs and CNNs. Given a target network {whose weights are
independently sampled from appropriate distributions}, we provide a universal
approach to bound the gap between a pruned and the target network in a
probabilistic sense. The results establish that there exist pruned networks

must be equally as modular as the mechanism. Given the large number of designs
that can be generated from even a small set of modules, it becomes impractical
to create a new system-wide controller for each design. Instead, we construct a
modular control policy that handles a broad class of designs. We take the view
that a module is both form and function, i.e. both mechanism and controller. As
the modules are physically re-configured, the policy automatically
re-configures to match the kinematic structure. This novel policy is trained
with a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which interleaves
model learning and trajectory optimization to guide policy learning for
multiple designs simultaneously. Training the policy on a varied set of designs
teaches it how to adapt its behavior to the design. We show that the policy can
then generalize to a larger set of designs not seen during training. We
demonstrate one policy controlling many designs with different combinations of
legs and wheels to locomote both in simulation and on real robots.</span>

taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identifying
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple
and plug-and-play open set recognition modules that can be attached to
pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for

diagnosis, supporting experts in this task. To perform an automatic diagnosis,
prostate tissue samples are first digitized into gigapixel-resolution
whole-slide images. Due to the size of these images, neural networks cannot use
them as input and, therefore, small subimages called patches are extracted and
predicted, obtaining a patch-level classification. In this work, a novel patch
aggregation method based on a custom Wide &amp; Deep neural network model is
presented, which performs a slide-level classification using the patch-level
classes obtained from a CNN. The malignant tissue ratio, a 10-bin malignant
probability histogram, the least squares regression line of the histogram, and
the number of malignant connected components are used by the proposed model to
perform the classification. An accuracy of 94.24% and a sensitivity of 98.87%
were achieved, proving that the proposed system could aid pathologists by
speeding up the screening process and, thus, contribute to the fight against
PCa.</span>

                                        <span>Imitation learning seeks to circumvent the difficulty in designing proper
reward functions for training agents by utilizing expert behavior. With
environments modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), most of the existing
imitation algorithms are contingent on the availability of expert
demonstrations in the same MDP as the one in which a new imitation policy is to
be learned. In this paper, we study the problem of how to imitate tasks when
there exist discrepancies between the expert and agent MDP. These discrepancies
across domains could include differing dynamics, viewpoint, or morphology; we
present a novel framework to learn correspondences across such domains.
Importantly, in contrast to prior works, we use unpaired and unaligned
trajectories containing only states in the expert domain, to learn this
correspondence. We utilize a cycle-consistency constraint on both the state
space and a domain agnostic latent space to do this. In addition, we enforce
consistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position
estimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains. Once this
correspondence is found, we can directly transfer the demonstrations on one
domain to the other and use it for imitation. Experiments across a wide variety
of challenging domains demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</span>

non-uniform sampling of quasi-static spatial fields. We address the problem of
efficient data collection using multiple autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we
are interested in analyzing the effect of communication between multiple
robots, acting independently, on the overall sampling performance of the team.
Our focus is on distributed sampling problem where the robots are operating
independent of their teammates, but have the ability to communicate their
states to other neighbors with a constraint on the communication range. We
design and apply an informed non-myopic path planning technique on multiple
robotic platforms to efficiently collect measurements from a spatial field. Our
proposed approach is highly adaptive to challenging environments, growing team
size, and runs in real-time, which are the key features for any real-world
scenario. The results show that our distributed sampling approach is able to
achieve efficient sampling with minimal communication between the robots. We
evaluate our approach in simulation over multiple distributions commonly
occurring in nature and on the real-world data collected during a field trial.</span>

                                        <span>Oxygen consumption (VO$_2$) provides established clinical and physiological
indicators of cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity. However, VO$_2$
monitoring is largely limited to specialized laboratory settings, making its
widespread monitoring elusive. Here, we investigate temporal prediction of
VO$_2$ from wearable sensors during cycle ergometer exercise using a temporal
convolutional network (TCN). Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired from a
smart shirt with integrated textile sensors alongside ground-truth VO$_2$ from
a metabolic system on twenty-two young healthy adults. Participants performed
one ramp-incremental and three pseudorandom binary sequence exercise protocols
to assess a range of VO$_2$ dynamics. A TCN model was developed using causal
convolutions across an effective history length to model the time-dependent
nature of VO$_2$. Optimal history length was determined through minimum
validation loss across hyperparameter values. The best performing model encoded
218 s history length (TCN-VO$_2$ A), with 187 s, 97 s, and 76 s yielding less
than 3% deviation from the optimal validation loss. TCN-VO$_2$ A showed strong
prediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (-22
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-262, 218]), spanning transitions from low-moderate (-23
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-250, 204]), low-heavy (14 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-252, 280]),
ventilatory threshold-heavy (-49 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-274, 176]), and maximal (-32
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-261, 197]) exercise. Second-by-second classification of
physical activity across 16090 s of predicted VO$_2$ was able to discern
between vigorous, moderate, and light activity with high accuracy (94.1%). This
system enables quantitative aerobic activity monitoring in non-laboratory
settings across a range of exercise intensities using wearable sensors for
monitoring exercise prescription adherence and personal fitness.</span>

the best predictor in a benchmark hypothesis class, where competitiveness is
measured with respect to a given loss function. However, its predictions might
be quite sub-optimal for structured subgroups of individuals, such as protected
demographic groups. Motivated by such fairness concerns, we study &quot;multi-group

learn a single predictor such that the loss experienced by every group $g \in

Under natural conditions, we provide a characterization of the loss functions
for which such a predictor is guaranteed to exist. For any such loss function
we construct a learning algorithm whose sample complexity is logarithmic in the

into a particular configuration. Here, we consider what information belongs to
the configuration, or ordering, of 4286 Kepler planets in their 3277 planetary
systems. First, we train a neural network model to predict the radius and
period of a planet based on the properties of its host star and the radii and
period of its neighbors. The mean absolute error of the predictions of the
trained model is a factor of 2.1 better than the MAE of the predictions of a
naive model which draws randomly from dynamically allowable periods and radii.
Second, we adapt a model used for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging in
computational linguistics to investigate whether planets or planetary systems
fall into natural categories with physically interpretable &quot;grammatical rules.&quot;
The model identifies two robust groups of planetary systems: (1) compact
multi-planet systems and (2) systems around giant stars ($\log{g} \lesssim
4.0$), although the latter group is strongly sculpted by the selection bias of
the transit method. These results reinforce the idea that planetary systems are
not random sequences -- instead, as a population, they contain predictable

                                        <span>The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet
have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing
datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap
between a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting
problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same
task on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal
knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to
effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to
traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be
lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student
model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its
teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify
this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised

color distortions caused by lighting effects. The proposed method allows us to
adjust three target-colors chosen by a user in an input image so that each
target color is the same as the corresponding destination (benchmark) one. In
contrast, white balancing is a typical technique for reducing the color
distortions, however, they cannot remove lighting effects on colors other than
white. In an experiment, the proposed method is demonstrated to be able to
remove lighting effects on selected three colors, and is compared with existing
white balance adjustments.</span>

induce noise into video feeds. We observe that popular unsupervised MOT methods
are dependent on noise-free conditions. We show that the addition of a small
amount of artificial random noise causes a sharp degradation in model
performance on benchmark metrics. We resolve this problem by introducing a
robust unsupervised multi-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net. The proposed
single-head attention model helps limit the negative impact of noise by
learning visual representations at different segment scales. AttU-Net shows
better unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based
state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate our method in the MNIST and the Atari
game video benchmark. We also provide two extended video datasets consisting of
complex visual patterns that include Kuzushiji characters and fashion images to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

resolution of their inputs, but the scaling factors are limited to integer
values. However, in many image and video processing applications, the ability
to resize by a fractional factor would be advantageous. One example is
conversion between resolutions standardized for video compression, such as from
1080p to 720p. To solve this problem, we propose an alternative building block,
formulated as a conventional convolutional layer followed by a differentiable
resizer. More concretely, the convolutional layer preserves the resolution of
the input, while the resizing operation is fully handled by the resizer. In
this way, any CNN architecture can be adapted for non-integer resizing. As an
application, we replace the resizing convolutional layer of a modern deep
downsampling model by the proposed building block, and apply it to an adaptive
bitrate video streaming scenario. Our experimental results show that an
improvement in coding efficiency over the conventional Lanczos algorithm is
attained, in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF on test videos.</span>

to explore Chinese sequence labelling tasks due to their respective strengths.
However, existing methods solely fuse lexicon features via a shallow and random
initialized sequence layer and do not integrate them into the bottom layers of
BERT. In this paper, we propose Lexicon Enhanced BERT (LEBERT) for Chinese
sequence labelling, which integrates external lexicon knowledge into BERT
layers directly by a Lexicon Adapter layer. Compared with the existing methods,
our model facilitates deep lexicon knowledge fusion at the lower layers of
BERT. Experiments on ten Chinese datasets of three tasks including Named Entity

achieves the state-of-the-art results.</span>

available contain English data. In this paper, we take advantage of available
English datasets by applying cross-lingual contextual word embeddings and
transfer learning to make predictions in low-resource languages. We project
predictions on comparable data in Arabic, Bengali, Danish, Greek, Hindi,
Spanish, and Turkish. We report results of 0.8415 F1 macro for Bengali in
TRAC-2 shared task, 0.8532 F1 macro for Danish and 0.8701 F1 macro for Greek in
OffensEval 2020, 0.8568 F1 macro for Hindi in HASOC 2019 shared task and 0.7513
F1 macro for Spanish in in SemEval-2019 Task 5 (HatEval) showing that our
approach compares favourably to the best systems submitted to recent shared
tasks on these three languages. Additionally, we report competitive performance
on Arabic, and Turkish using the training and development sets of OffensEval
2020 shared task. The results for all languages confirm the robustness of
cross-lingual contextual embeddings and transfer learning for this task.</span>

abstract syntactic information present in these sentences in a manner that is
consistent with the grammar of English, or do they rely solely on a set of
heuristics? We propose a method to tackle this question, AlterRep. For any
linguistic feature in the sentence, AlterRep allows us to generate
counterfactual representations by altering how this feature is encoded, while
leaving all other aspects of the original representation intact. Then, by
measuring the change in a models&#x27; word prediction with these counterfactual
representations in different sentences, we can draw causal conclusions about
the contexts in which the model uses the linguistic feature (if any). Applying
this method to study how BERT uses relative clause (RC) span information, we
found that BERT uses information about RC spans during agreement prediction
using the linguistically correct strategy. We also found that counterfactual
representations generated for a specific RC subtype influenced the number
prediction in sentences with other RC subtypes, suggesting that information
about RC boundaries was encoded abstractly in BERT&#x27;s representation.</span>

                                        <span>Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences
from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error
rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a
sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine
translation by a large margin.</span>

knowledge in both known and unknown domains. For example, one may be an expert
in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but want to determine the best
order to learn new concepts in an unfamiliar Computer Vision domain (CV). Both
domains share some common concepts, such as machine learning basics and deep
learning models. In this paper, we propose unsupervised cross-domain concept
prerequisite chain learning using an optimized variational graph autoencoder.
Our model learns to transfer concept prerequisite relations from an
information-rich domain (source domain) to an information-poor domain (target
domain), substantially surpassing other baseline models. Also, we expand an
existing dataset by introducing two new domains: CV and Bioinformatics (BIO).
The annotated data and resources, as well as the code, will be made publicly

                                        <span>Recent works have shown that language models (LM) capture different types of
knowledge regarding facts or common sense. However, because no model is
perfect, they still fail to provide appropriate answers in many cases. In this
paper, we ask the question &quot;how can we know when language models know, with
confidence, the answer to a particular query?&quot; We examine this question from
the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic model&#x27;s
predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probabilities
of correctness. We examine three strong generative models -- T5, BART, and
GPT-2 -- and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated,
finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to
calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the
likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability
modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on
a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We
also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods,
shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for
calibrating LMs. We have released the code at

multi-modal tasks, and cannot effectively adapt to each other. They can only
utilize single-modal data (i.e. text or image) or limited multi-modal data
(i.e. image-text pairs). In this work, we propose a unified-modal pre-training
architecture, namely UNIMO, which can effectively adapt to both single-modal
and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. Large scale of free text
corpus and image collections can be utilized to improve the capability of
visual and textual understanding, and cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL)
is leveraged to align the textual and visual information into a unified
semantic space over a corpus of image-text pairs. As the non-paired
single-modal data is very rich, our model can utilize much larger scale of data
to learn more generalizable representations. Moreover, the textual knowledge
and visual knowledge can enhance each other in the unified semantic space. The
experimental results show that UNIMO significantly improves the performance of
several single-modal and multi-modal downstream tasks. Our code and pre-trained
models are public at

distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However,
it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing
cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of
its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like
racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a
machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the
first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online
antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting
signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling
multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any
publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect
and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and
Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that
detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism
category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of
experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.</span>

                                        <span>Human language has been described as a system that makes \textit{use of
finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts}. Of particular interest
is the aspect of compositionality, whereby, the meaning of a compound language
expression can be deduced from the meaning of its constituent parts. If
artificial agents can develop compositional communication protocols akin to
human language, they can be made to seamlessly generalize to unseen
combinations. However, the real question is, how do we induce compositionality
in emergent communication? Studies have recognized the role of curiosity in
enabling linguistic development in children. It is this same intrinsic urge
that drives us to master complex tasks with decreasing amounts of explicit
reward. In this paper, we seek to use this intrinsic feedback in inducing a
systematic and unambiguous protolanguage in artificial agents. We show how
these rewards can be leveraged in training agents to induce compositionality in
absence of any external feedback. Additionally, we introduce gComm, an
environment for investigating grounded language acquisition in 2D-grid
environments. Using this, we demonstrate how compositionality can enable agents
to not only interact with unseen objects but also transfer skills from one task
to another in a zero-shot setting: \textit{Can an agent, trained to &#x60;pull&#x27; and
&#x60;push twice&#x27;, &#x60;pull twice&#x27;?}.</span>

languages. While pretrained transformers for these languages can be made, it is
challenging to measure their true performance and capacity due to the lack of

In this paper, we present three contributions: First, we propose a methodology
for automatically producing Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark datasets
for low-resource languages using published news articles. Through this, we
create and release NewsPH-NLI, the first sentence entailment benchmark dataset

society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted
settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary
natural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this
specification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,
we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our
benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line
solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large
language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the
prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as
GPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,
so we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As
the social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming
years, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking
advancements.</span>

                                        <span>Attention layers are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and are
beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large
transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once
trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,
it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.
This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.
Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query
projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables
heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of
parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query
dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and
vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained
multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.
Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query
projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.</span>

achieved state-of-the-art results in biomedical natural language processing
tasks by focusing their pre-training process on domain-specific corpora.
However, such models do not take into consideration expert domain knowledge.

In this work, we introduced UmlsBERT, a contextual embedding model that
integrates domain knowledge during the pre-training process via a novel
knowledge augmentation strategy. More specifically, the augmentation on
UmlsBERT with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus was
performed in two ways: i) connecting words that have the same underlying
&#x60;concept&#x27; in UMLS, and ii) leveraging semantic group knowledge in UMLS to
create clinically meaningful input embeddings. By applying these two
strategies, UmlsBERT can encode clinical domain knowledge into word embeddings
and outperform existing domain-specific models on common named-entity
recognition (NER) and clinical natural language inference clinical NLP tasks.</span>

task aggravates the discrepancies between source and target datasets. We
explore the topic bias and the task formulation bias in cross-dataset

are biased towards platform-specific topics. We identify these examples using
unsupervised topic modeling and manual inspection of topics&#x27; keywords. Removing

recognition becomes a key component to deliver relevant search results. Errors
introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) lead to irrelevant search
results returned to the user, thus causing user dissatisfaction. In this paper,
we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space
without depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to
system constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run
on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several
proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making
internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis
showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries
is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR
systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant
improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in
one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as
complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not
be frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts.</span>

is trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent
approaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional
features and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase
model complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.
A single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer
learning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of
additional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,
outperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95
METEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to
their context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also
introduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not
previously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model
capacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended
in order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs

conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core
of $2.1$--$2.7$~GHz CPU on a real-time factor of $0.87$--$0.95$, including
input/output, feature extraction, on a frame shift of $10$ ms, a window length

                                        <span>This paper presents a novel high-fidelity and low-latency universal neural
vocoder framework based on multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction
for discrete waveform modeling (MWDLP). MWDLP employs a coarse-fine bit WaveRNN
architecture for 10-bit mu-law waveform modeling. A sparse gated recurrent unit
with a relatively large size of hidden units is utilized, while the multiband
modeling is deployed to achieve real-time low-latency usage. A novel technique
for data-driven linear prediction (LP) with discrete waveform modeling is
proposed, where the LP coefficients are estimated in a data-driven manner.
Moreover, a novel loss function using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for
discrete waveform modeling with Gumbel approximation is also proposed. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MWDLP framework generates
high-fidelity synthetic speech for seen and unseen speakers and/or language on
300 speakers training data including clean and noisy/reverberant conditions,
where the number of training utterances is limited to 60 per speaker, while
allowing for real-time low-latency processing using a single core of $\sim\!$
2.1--2.7~GHz CPU with $\sim\!$ 0.57--0.64 real-time factor including
input/output and feature extraction.</span>

                                        <span>An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural
document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -
e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based
document ranking models.</span>

                                        <span>Constituent and dependency parsing, the two classic forms of syntactic
parsing, have been found to benefit from joint training and decoding under a
uniform formalism, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). However,
decoding this unified grammar has a higher time complexity ($O(n^5)$) than
decoding either form individually ($O(n^3)$) since more factors have to be
considered during decoding. We thus propose an improved head scorer that helps
achieve a novel performance-preserved parser in $O$($n^3$) time complexity.
Furthermore, on the basis of this proposed practical HPSG parser, we
investigated the strengths of HPSG-based parsing and explored the general
method of training an HPSG-based parser from only a constituent or dependency
annotations in a multilingual scenario. We thus present a more effective, more
in-depth, and general work on HPSG parsing.</span>

                                        <span>We introduce Korean Language Understanding Evaluation (KLUE) benchmark. KLUE
is a collection of 8 Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks,
including Topic Classification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural Language
Inference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing,
Machine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We build all of the
tasks from scratch from diverse source corpora while respecting copyrights, to
ensure accessibility for anyone without any restrictions. With ethical
considerations in mind, we carefully design annotation protocols. Along with
the benchmark tasks and data, we provide suitable evaluation metrics and
fine-tuning recipes for pretrained language models for each task. We
furthermore release the pretrained language models (PLM), KLUE-BERT and
KLUE-RoBERTa, to help reproduce baseline models on KLUE and thereby facilitate
future research. We make a few interesting observations from the preliminary
experiments using the proposed KLUE benchmark suite, already demonstrating the
usefulness of this new benchmark suite. First, we find KLUE-RoBERTa-large
outperforms other baselines, including multilingual PLMs and existing
open-source Korean PLMs. Second, we see minimal degradation in performance even
when we replace personally identifiable information from the pretraining
corpus, suggesting that privacy and NLU capability are not at odds with each
other. Lastly, we find that using BPE tokenization in combination with
morpheme-level pre-tokenization is effective in tasks involving morpheme-level
tagging, detection and generation. In addition to accelerating Korean NLP
research, our comprehensive documentation on creating KLUE will facilitate
creating similar resources for other languages in the future. KLUE is available
at this https URL (https://klue-benchmark.com/).</span>

attention in the past few years as it can utilize large-scale auto-labeled
data. However, its evaluation has long been a problem: previous works either
took costly and inconsistent methods to manually examine a small sample of
model predictions, or directly test models on auto-labeled data -- which, by
our check, produce as much as 53% wrong labels at the entity pair level in the
popular NYT10 dataset. This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,
but also made it hard to understand where we are and what&#x27;s left to improve in
the research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we
build manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,
and thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest
pre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can
indicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some
unexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating
performance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to
previous methods. We hope that both our manual test sets and novel observations

                                        <span>Extensive research on target-dependent sentiment classification (TSC) has led
to strong classification performances in domains where authors tend to
explicitly express sentiment about specific entities or topics, such as in
reviews or on social media. We investigate TSC in news articles, a much less
researched domain, despite the importance of news as an essential information
source in individual and societal decision making. This article introduces
NewsTSC, a manually annotated dataset to explore TSC on news articles.
Investigating characteristics of sentiment in news and contrasting them to
popular TSC domains, we find that sentiment in the news is expressed less
explicitly, is more dependent on context and readership, and requires a greater
degree of interpretation. In an extensive evaluation, we find that the state of
the art in TSC performs worse on news articles than on other domains (average
recall AvgRec &#x3D; 69.8 on NewsTSC compared to AvgRev &#x3D; [75.6, 82.2] on
established TSC datasets). Reasons include incorrectly resolved relation of
target and sentiment-bearing phrases and off-context dependence. As a major
improvement over previous news TSC, we find that BERT&#x27;s natural language
understanding capabilities capture the less explicit sentiment used in news
articles.</span>

is based on measuring communication patterns, through social network and

demonstrate that self-reflection can trigger a change in communication
behaviors, which lead to increased customer satisfaction. We illustrate and
test our approach analyzing e-mails of a large global services company by
comparing changes in customer satisfaction associated with team leaders exposed
to virtual mirroring (the experimental group). We find an increase in customer
satisfaction in the experimental group and a decrease in the control group
(team leaders not involved in the virtual mirroring process). With regard to
the individual communication indicators, we find that customer satisfaction is
higher when employees are more responsive, use a simpler language, are embedded
in less centralized communication networks, and show more stable leadership
patterns.</span>

                                        <span>Distributional semantics has deeply changed in the last decades. First,
predict models stole the thunder from traditional count ones, and more recently
both of them were replaced in many NLP applications by contextualized vectors
produced by Transformer neural language models. Although an extensive body of
research has been devoted to Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) evaluation, we
still lack a thorough comparison with respect to tested models, semantic tasks,
and benchmark datasets. Moreover, previous work has mostly focused on
task-driven evaluation, instead of exploring the differences between the way
models represent the lexical semantic space. In this paper, we perform a
comprehensive evaluation of type distributional vectors, either produced by
static DSMs or obtained by averaging the contextualized vectors generated by
BERT. First of all, we investigate the performance of embeddings in several
semantic tasks, carrying out an in-depth statistical analysis to identify the
major factors influencing the behavior of DSMs. The results show that i.) the
alleged superiority of predict based models is more apparent than real, and
surely not ubiquitous and ii.) static DSMs surpass contextualized
representations in most out-of-context semantic tasks and datasets.
Furthermore, we borrow from cognitive neuroscience the methodology of
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to inspect the semantic spaces
generated by distributional models. RSA reveals important differences related
to the frequency and part-of-speech of lexical items.</span>

                                        <span>Today, we are seeing an ever-increasing number of clinical notes that contain
clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of patient&#x27;s health state.
All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can
help people and domain experts with their common healthcare tasks. However,
many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.</span>

psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing. Previous work on
computational modelling of empathy in motivational interviewing has focused on
offline, session-level assessment of therapist empathy, where empathy captures
all efforts that the therapist makes to understand the client&#x27;s perspective and
convey that understanding to the client. In this position paper, we propose a
novel task of turn-level detection of client need for empathy. Concretely, we
propose to leverage pre-trained language models and empathy-related general
conversation corpora in a unique labeller-detector framework, where the
labeller automatically annotates a motivational interviewing conversation
corpus with empathy labels to train the detector that determines the need for
therapist empathy. We also lay out our strategies of extending the detector

to encode semantic information and model event inter-dependency at a
document-level. In this paper, we reformulate it as a Seq2Seq task and propose
a Multi-Layer Bidirectional Network (MLBiNet) to capture the document-level
association of events and semantic information simultaneously. Specifically, a
bidirectional decoder is firstly devised to model event inter-dependency within
a sentence when decoding the event tag vector sequence. Secondly, an
information aggregation module is employed to aggregate sentence-level semantic
and event tag information. Finally, we stack multiple bidirectional decoders
and feed cross-sentence information, forming a multi-layer bidirectional
tagging architecture to iteratively propagate information across sentences. We
show that our approach provides significant improvement in performance compared

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an
emphasis on the quality of non-English language directions. Our intuition is
based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose \method, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mCOLT is empowered by two techniques: (i) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and (ii) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mCOLT achieves
competitive or even better performance than a strong pre-trained model mBART on
tens of WMT benchmarks. For non-English directions, mCOLT achieves an
improvement of average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual baseline.</span>

                                        <span>In 2019, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Health Outcomes Challenge seeking solutions to
predict risk in value-based care for incorporation into CMS Innovation Center
payment and service delivery models. Recently, modern language models have
played key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to
the best of our knowledge, the first application of these models to patient
readmission prediction. To facilitate this, we create a dataset of 1.2 million
medical history samples derived from the Limited Dataset (LDS) issued by CMS.
Moreover, we propose a comprehensive modeling solution centered on a deep
learning framework for this data. To demonstrate the framework, we train an
attention-based Transformer to learn Medicare semantics in support of
performing downstream prediction tasks thereby achieving 0.91 AUC and 0.91
recall on readmission classification. We also introduce a novel data
pre-processing pipeline and discuss pertinent deployment considerations
surrounding model explainability and bias.</span>

                                        <span>Dependency parsing is a crucial step towards deep language understanding and,
therefore, widely demanded by numerous Natural Language Processing
applications. In particular, left-to-right and top-down transition-based
algorithms that rely on Pointer Networks are among the most accurate approaches
for performing dependency parsing. Additionally, it has been observed for the
top-down algorithm that Pointer Networks&#x27; sequential decoding can be improved
by implementing a hierarchical variant, more adequate to model dependency
structures. Considering all this, we develop a bottom-up-oriented Hierarchical
Pointer Network for the left-to-right parser and propose two novel
transition-based alternatives: an approach that parses a sentence in
right-to-left order and a variant that does it from the outside in. We
empirically test the proposed neural architecture with the different algorithms
on a wide variety of languages, outperforming the original approach in
practically all of them and setting new state-of-the-art results on the English
and Chinese Penn Treebanks for non-contextualized and BERT-based embeddings.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, abstractive text summarization with multimodal inputs has
started drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from
different source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,
existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as
the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long
ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to
generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce
AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with
videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic
conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding
research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and
uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\name}, a factorized
multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently
captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input
modalities for the text summarization task. {\name} utilizes an increasing
number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly
better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments
illustrate that {\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for
short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse
duration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$
ROUGE-L points respectively.</span>

aims at generating answers to questions phrased in natural language. While
there has been substantial progress in open-domain question answering, QA
systems are still struggling to answer questions which involve geographic
entities or concepts and that require spatial operations. In this paper, we
discuss the problem of geographic question answering (GeoQA). We first
investigate the reasons why geographic questions are difficult to answer by
analyzing challenges of geographic questions. We discuss the uniqueness of
geographic questions compared to general QA. Then we review existing work on
GeoQA and classify them by the types of questions they can address. Based on
this survey, we provide a generic classification framework for geographic
questions. Finally, we conclude our work by pointing out unique future research
directions for GeoQA.</span>

classifying them into specific event types. In real-world applications, ED
typically does not have sufficient labelled data, thus can be formulated as a
few-shot learning problem. To tackle the issue of low sample diversity in
few-shot ED, we propose a novel knowledge-based few-shot event detection method
which uses a definition-based encoder to introduce external event knowledge as
the knowledge prior of event types. Furthermore, as external knowledge
typically provides limited and imperfect coverage of event types, we introduce
an adaptive knowledge-enhanced Bayesian meta-learning method to dynamically
adjust the knowledge prior of event types. Experiments show our method
consistently and substantially outperforms a number of baselines by at least 15
absolute F1 points under the same few-shot settings.</span>

                                        <span>Recent studies constructing direct interactions between the claim and each
single user response (a comment or a relevant article) to capture evidence have
shown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. Owing to
different single responses convey different cognition of individual users
(i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of
individual cognition. However, individuals&#x27; cognition of social things is not
always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased
semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly
contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task
performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of
Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim
verification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture
the word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on
sentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and
adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view
of individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of
difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence
fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise
inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence
for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both. Experiments
on three benchmark datasets confirm that CICD achieves state-of-the-art
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Object detection can be regarded as a pixel clustering task, and its boundary
is determined by four extreme points (leftmost, top, rightmost, and bottom).
However, most studies focus on the center or corner points of the object, which
are actually conditional results of the extreme points. In this paper, we
present an Extreme-Point-Prediction-Based object detector (EPP-Net), which
directly regresses the relative displacement vector between each pixel and the
four extreme points. We also propose a new metric to measure the similarity
between two groups of extreme points, namely, Extreme Intersection over Union
(EIoU), and incorporate this EIoU as a new regression loss. Moreover, we
propose a novel branch to predict the EIoU between the ground-truth and the
prediction results, and combine it with the classification confidence as the
ranking keyword in non-maximum suppression. On the MS-COCO dataset, our method
achieves an average precision (AP) of 44.0% with ResNet-50 and an AP of 48.3%
with ResNeXt-101-DCN. The proposed EPP-Net provides a new method to detect
objects and outperforms state-of-the-art anchor-free detectors.</span>

                                        <span>As climate change increases the intensity of natural disasters, society needs
better tools for adaptation. Floods, for example, are the most frequent natural
disaster, and better tools for flood risk communication could increase the
support for flood-resilient infrastructure development. Our work aims to enable
more visual communication of large-scale climate impacts via visualizing the
output of coastal flood models as satellite imagery. We propose the first deep
learning pipeline to ensure physical-consistency in synthetic visual satellite
imagery. We advanced a state-of-the-art GAN called pix2pixHD, such that it
produces imagery that is physically-consistent with the output of an
expert-validated storm surge model (NOAA SLOSH). By evaluating the imagery
relative to physics-based flood maps, we find that our proposed framework
outperforms baseline models in both physical-consistency and photorealism. We
envision our work to be the first step towards a global visualization of how
climate change shapes our landscape. Continuing on this path, we show that the
proposed pipeline generalizes to visualize arctic sea ice melt. We also publish
a dataset of over 25k labelled image-pairs to study image-to-image translation
in Earth observation.</span>

                                        <span>Bone mineral density (BMD) is a clinically critical indicator of
osteoporosis, usually measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Due
to the limited accessibility of DEXA machines and examinations, osteoporosis is
often under-diagnosed and under-treated, leading to increased fragility
fracture risks. Thus it is highly desirable to obtain BMDs with alternative
cost-effective and more accessible medical imaging examinations such as X-ray
plain films. In this work, we formulate the BMD estimation from plain hip X-ray
images as a regression problem. Specifically, we propose a new semi-supervised
self-training algorithm to train the BMD regression model using images coupled
with DEXA measured BMDs and unlabeled images with pseudo BMDs. Pseudo BMDs are
generated and refined iteratively for unlabeled images during self-training. We
also present a novel adaptive triplet loss to improve the model&#x27;s regression
accuracy. On an in-house dataset of 1,090 images (819 unique patients), our BMD
estimation method achieves a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8805 to
ground-truth BMDs. It offers good feasibility to use the more accessible and
cheaper X-ray imaging for opportunistic osteoporosis screening.</span>

                                        <span>Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has demonstrated great potential in
quantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the
intrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying
susceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue
susceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve
accuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch
between the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the
susceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning
architecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical
model, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the
relationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility
tensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The
convolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a
regularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by
ki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative
evaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed
deep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior
performance, demonstrating its potential for future applications.</span>

of past 3D skeletons. While this problem has recently received increasing
attention, it has mostly been tackled for single humans in isolation. In this
paper we explore this problem from a novel perspective, involving humans
performing collaborative tasks. We assume that the input of our system are two
sequences of past skeletons for two interacting persons, and we aim to predict
the future motion for each of them. For this purpose, we devise a novel cross
interaction attention mechanism that exploits historical information of both
persons and learns to predict cross dependencies between self poses and the
poses of the other person in spite of their spatial or temporal distance. Since
no dataset to train such interactive situations is available, we have captured
ExPI (Extreme Pose Interaction), a new lab-based person interaction dataset of
professional dancers performing acrobatics. ExPI contains 115 sequences with
30k frames and 60k instances with annotated 3D body poses and shapes. We
thoroughly evaluate our cross-interaction network on this dataset and show that
both in short-term and long-term predictions, it consistently outperforms
baselines that independently reason for each person. We plan to release our
code jointly with the dataset and the train/test splits to spur future research
on the topic.</span>

large scale dataset against a query image. Generally, the similarity between
the representative features of the query image and dataset images is used to
rank the images for retrieval. In early days, various hand designed feature
descriptors have been investigated based on the visual cues such as color,
texture, shape, etc. that represent the images. However, the deep learning has
emerged as a dominating alternative of hand-designed feature engineering from a
decade. It learns the features automatically from the data. This paper presents
a comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade
for content based image retrieval. The categorization of existing
state-of-the-art methods from different perspectives is also performed for
greater understanding of the progress. The taxonomy used in this survey covers
different supervision, different networks, different descriptor type and
different retrieval type. A performance analysis is also performed using the
state-of-the-art methods. The insights are also presented for the benefit of
the researchers to observe the progress and to make the best choices. The
survey presented in this paper will help in further research progress in image
retrieval using deep learning.</span>

                                        <span>Chest X-rays of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are frequently
obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest
X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal
shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,
and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To
accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available
chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage
existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection &quot;chest X-ray&quot;
images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an
automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays
comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest
X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On
a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model
achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a
dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50
projections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines
with limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity
quantification on chest X-rays.</span>

image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches
commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face
limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial
locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial
success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations,
this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and
normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name
Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially
a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through
attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN
into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced
stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform
for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces
visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.</span>

                                        <span>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), a family of techniques for monitoring
blood volume changes, may be especially useful for widespread contactless
health monitoring using face video from consumer-grade visible-light cameras.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the widespread use of protective face masks.
We found that occlusions from cloth face masks increased the mean absolute
error of heart rate estimation by more than 80\% when deploying methods
designed on unmasked faces. We show that augmenting unmasked face videos by
adding patterned synthetic face masks forces the model to attend to the
periocular and forehead regions, improving performance and closing the gap
between masked and unmasked pulse estimation. To our knowledge, this paper is
the first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of pulse
estimation and offers several novel contributions: (a) 3D CNN-based method
designed for remote photoplethysmography in a presence of face masks, (b) two
publicly available pulse estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61
masked subjects, (c) evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D CNN trained
on videos of unmasked faces and with masks synthetically added, and (d) data
augmentation method to add a synthetic mask to a face video.</span>

the previous studies focus on the correlation between speech content and the
mouth shape. Facial emotion, which is one of the most important features on
natural human faces, is always neglected in their methods. In this work, we
present Emotional Video Portraits (EVP), a system for synthesizing high-quality
video portraits with vivid emotional dynamics driven by audios. Specifically,
we propose the Cross-Reconstructed Emotion Disentanglement technique to
decompose speech into two decoupled spaces, i.e., a duration-independent
emotion space and a duration dependent content space. With the disentangled
features, dynamic 2D emotional facial landmarks can be deduced. Then we propose
the Target-Adaptive Face Synthesis technique to generate the final high-quality
video portraits, by bridging the gap between the deduced landmarks and the
natural head poses of target videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.</span>

                                        <span>Object recognition in unseen indoor environments remains a challenging
problem for visual perception of mobile robots. In this letter, we propose the
use of topologically persistent features, which rely on the objects&#x27; shape
information, to address this challenge. In particular, we extract two kinds of
features, namely, sparse persistence image (PI) and amplitude, by applying
persistent homology to multi-directional height function-based filtrations of
the cubical complexes representing the object segmentation maps. The features
are then used to train a fully connected network for recognition. For
performance evaluation, in addition to a widely used shape dataset and a
benchmark indoor scenes dataset, we collect a new dataset, comprising scene
images from two different environments, namely, a living room and a mock
warehouse. The scenes are captured using varying camera poses under different
illumination conditions and include up to five different objects from a given
set of fourteen objects. On the benchmark indoor scenes dataset, sparse PI
features show better recognition performance in unseen environments than the
features learned using the widely used ResNetV2-56 and EfficientNet-B4 models.
Further, they provide slightly higher recall and accuracy values than Faster
R-CNN, an end-to-end object detection method, and its state-of-the-art variant,
Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN. The performance of our methods also remains
relatively unchanged from the training environment (living room) to the unseen
environment (mock warehouse) in the new dataset. In contrast, the performance
of the object detection methods drops substantially. We also implement the
proposed method on a real-world robot to demonstrate its usefulness.</span>

proposed as a supplement to the definitive RT-PCR test. We present a deep
learning ensemble for detecting COVID-19 infection, combining slice-based (2D)
and volume-based (3D) approaches. The 2D system detects the infection on each
CT slice independently, combining them to obtain the patient-level decision via
different methods (averaging and long-short term memory networks). The 3D
system takes the whole CT volume to arrive to the patient-level decision in one
step. A new high resolution chest CT scan dataset, called the IST-C dataset, is
also collected in this work. The proposed ensemble, called IST-CovNet, obtains
90.80% accuracy and 0.95 AUC score overall on the IST-C dataset in detecting
COVID-19 among normal controls and other types of lung pathologies; and 93.69%
accuracy and 0.99 AUC score on the publicly available MosMed dataset that
consists of COVID-19 scans and normal controls only. The system is deployed at

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs&#x27; performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

solar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground
are used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the
electricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the
Sun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a
reference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking
methods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires
access to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an
image-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is
visible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We
validate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA&#x27;s
lab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth
Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size.</span>

                                        <span>Policies trained in simulation often fail when transferred to the real world
due to the &#x60;reality gap&#x27; where the simulator is unable to accurately capture
the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to
tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and
engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to
learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too
conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system
parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world
without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to
reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively
shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system
parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of
observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the
given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate
the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in
both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement
over naive domain randomization. Project videos and code at

In this project, we have implemented and experimented with various flavors of
multi-modal image captioning networks where ResNet101, DenseNet121 and VGG19

studied the effect of beam size and the use of pretrained word embeddings and
compared them to baseline CNN encoder and RNN decoder architecture. The goal is
to analyze the performance of each approach using various evaluation metrics
including BLEU, CIDEr, ROUGE and METEOR. We have also explored model
explainability using Visual Attention Maps (VAM) to highlight parts of the

                                        <span>Detection faults in seismic data is a crucial step for seismic structural
interpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent
works regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation
requires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure
and lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a
huge workload. In this study, we present {\lambda}-BCE and {\lambda}-smooth
L1loss to effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that
the model can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices.
In order to fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic
noise, we propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision
training and embedded in the network. The attention heatmap target is generated
by the original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the
{\lambda}-smooth L1loss. The experiment proves the effectiveness of our loss
function and attention module, it also shows that our method can extract 3D
seismic features from a few 2D slices labels, and the segmentation effect
achieves state-of-the-art. We only use 3.3% of the all labels, and we can
achieve similar performance as using all labels. This work has been submitted

meaningful components, namely, camouflaged instances. To promote the new task
of camouflaged instance segmentation in-the-wild, we introduce a new dataset,
namely CAMO++, by extending our preliminary CAMO dataset (camouflaged object
segmentation) in terms of quantity and diversity. The new dataset substantially
increases the number of images with hierarchical pixel-wise ground-truths. We
also provide a benchmark suite for the task of camouflaged instance
segmentation. In particular, we conduct extensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods on our newly constructed CAMO++
dataset in various scenarios. We also propose Camouflage Fusion Learning (CFL)
framework for camouflaged instance segmentation to further improve the
state-of-the-art performance. The dataset, model, evaluation suite, and
benchmark will be publicly available at our project page.

process allows knowledge transfer across different domains, training a model on

classification benchmarks, we show a fast and effective alternative that

allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a
subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a
novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This
study indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop
MI-based BCI applications for new users without the need for calibration.</span>

requirements on the accuracy and efficiency of image super-resolution (SR) are
brought forward. Though existing methods have achieved remarkable success, the
majority of them demand plenty of computational resources and large amount of
RAM, and thus they can not be well applied to mobile device. In this paper, we
aim at designing efficient architecture for 8-bit quantization and deploy it on
mobile device. First, we conduct an experiment about meta-node latency by
decomposing lightweight SR architectures, which determines the portable
operations we can utilize. Then, we dig deeper into what kind of architecture
is beneficial to 8-bit quantization and propose anchor-based plain net (ABPN).
Finally, we adopt quantization-aware training strategy to further boost the
performance. Our model can outperform 8-bit quantized FSRCNN by nearly 2dB in
terms of PSNR, while satisfying realistic needs at the same time. Code is

for autonomous vehicle control from raw sensory input. While LiDAR sensors
provide reliably accurate information, existing end-to-end driving solutions
are mainly based on cameras since processing 3D data requires a large memory
footprint and computation cost. On the other hand, increasing the robustness of
these systems is also critical; however, even estimating the model&#x27;s

this paper, we present an efficient and robust LiDAR-based end-to-end

convolution kernel optimization and hardware-aware model design. We then
propose Hybrid Evidential Fusion that directly estimates the uncertainty of the
prediction from only a single forward pass and then fuses the control
predictions intelligently. We evaluate our system on a full-scale vehicle and
demonstrate lane-stable as well as navigation capabilities. In the presence of
out-of-distribution events (e.g., sensor failures), our system significantly
improves robustness and reduces the number of takeovers in the real world.</span>

                                        <span>For over 40 years lithographic silicon scaling has driven circuit integration
and performance improvement in the semiconductor industry. As silicon scaling
slows down, the industry is increasingly dependent on IC package technologies
to contribute to further circuit integration and performance improvements. This
is a paradigm shift and requires the IC package industry to reduce the size and
increase the density of internal interconnects on a scale which has never been
done before. Traditional package characterization and process optimization
relies on destructive techniques such as physical cross-sections and delayering
to extract data from internal package features. These destructive techniques
are not practical with today&#x27;s advanced packages. In this paper we will
demonstrate how data acquired non-destructively with a 3D X-ray microscope can
be enhanced and optimized using machine learning, and can then be used to
measure, characterize and optimize the design and production of buried
interconnects in advanced IC packages. Test vehicles replicating 2.5D and HBM
construction were designed and fabricated, and digital data was extracted from
these test vehicles using 3D X-ray and machine learning techniques. The
extracted digital data was used to characterize and optimize the design and
production of the interconnects and demonstrates a superior alternative to
destructive physical analysis. We report an mAP of 0.96 for 3D object
detection, a dice score of 0.92 for 3D segmentation, and an average of 2.1um
error for 3D metrology on the test dataset. This paper is the first part of a
multi-part report.</span>

                                        <span>In order to be globally deployed, autonomous cars must guarantee the safety
of pedestrians. This is the reason why forecasting pedestrians&#x27; intentions
sufficiently in advance is one of the most critical and challenging tasks for
autonomous vehicles. This work tries to solve this problem by jointly
predicting the intention and visual states of pedestrians. In terms of visual
states, whereas previous work focused on x-y coordinates, we will also predict
the size and indeed the whole bounding box of the pedestrian. The method is a
recurrent neural network in a multi-task learning approach. It has one head
that predicts the intention of the pedestrian for each one of its future
position and another one predicting the visual states of the pedestrian.
Experiments on the JAAD dataset show the superiority of the performance of our
method compared to previous works for intention prediction. Also, although its
simple architecture (more than 2 times faster), the performance of the bounding
box prediction is comparable to the ones yielded by much more complex
architectures. Our code is available online.</span>

of a new concept from just a few examples. Unlike popular computer vision
systems, humans can flexibly leverage the compositional structure of the visual
world, understanding new concepts as combinations of existing concepts. In the
current paper, we study how people learn different types of visual
compositions, using abstract visual forms with rich relational structure. We
find that people can make meaningful compositional generalizations from just a
few examples in a variety of scenarios, and we develop a Bayesian program
induction model that provides a close fit to the behavioral data. Unlike past

computational approach can account for many distinct types of compositional

                                        <span>The objective of this work is person-clustering in videos -- grouping
characters according to their identity. Previous methods focus on the narrower
task of face-clustering, and for the most part ignore other cues such as the
person&#x27;s voice, their overall appearance (hair, clothes, posture), and the
editing structure of the videos. Similarly, most current datasets evaluate only
the task of face-clustering, rather than person-clustering. This limits their
applicability to downstream applications such as story understanding which
require person-level, rather than only face-level, reasoning. In this paper we
make contributions to address both these deficiencies: first, we introduce a
Multi-Modal High-Precision Clustering algorithm for person-clustering in videos
using cues from several modalities (face, body, and voice). Second, we
introduce a Video Person-Clustering dataset, for evaluating multi-modal
person-clustering. It contains body-tracks for each annotated character,
face-tracks when visible, and voice-tracks when speaking, with their associated
features. The dataset is by far the largest of its kind, and covers films and
TV-shows representing a wide range of demographics. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of using multiple modalities for person-clustering, explore the
use of this new broad task for story understanding through character
co-occurrences, and achieve a new state of the art on all available datasets
for face and person-clustering.</span>

low-end embedded system platforms. Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a bio-inspired
RC model that mimics the cortical microcircuits and uses spiking neural
networks (SNN) that can be directly realized on neuromorphic hardware. In this
paper, we present a novel Parallelized LSM (PLSM) architecture that
incorporates spatio-temporal read-out layer and semantic constraints on model
output. To the best of our knowledge, such a formulation has been done for the
first time in literature, and it offers a computationally lighter alternative
to traditional deep-learning models. Additionally, we also present a
comprehensive algorithm for the implementation of parallelizable SNNs and LSMs
that are GPU-compatible. We implement the PLSM model to classify
unintentional/accidental video clips, using the Oops dataset. From the
experimental results on detecting unintentional action in video, it can be
observed that our proposed model outperforms a self-supervised model and a
fully supervised traditional deep learning model. All the implemented codes can
be found at our repository

as the overall image before making a decision. However, most existing deep
learning models only look at the entire X-ray image for classification, failing
to utilize important anatomical information. In this paper, we propose a novel
multi-label chest X-ray classification model that accurately classifies the
image finding and also localizes the findings to their correct anatomical
regions. Specifically, our model consists of two modules, the detection module
and the anatomical dependency module. The latter utilizes graph convolutional
networks, which enable our model to learn not only the label dependency but
also the relationship between the anatomical regions in the chest X-ray. We
further utilize a method to efficiently create an adjacency matrix for the
anatomical regions using the correlation of the label across the different
regions. Detailed experiments and analysis of our results show the
effectiveness of our method when compared to the current state-of-the-art
multi-label chest X-ray image classification methods while also providing
accurate location information.</span>

computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from human&#x27;s visual and intuitive perspective. We take
the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique
to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.
The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored
Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it
using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an
overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are
selected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the
effectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study
of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for
the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological
indices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception
augmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and
augmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology
study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.</span>

generators have become increasingly popular and accessible, causing dystopian
scenarios towards social erosion of trust. A particular domain, such as
biological signals, attracted attention towards detection methods that are
capable of exploiting authenticity signatures in real videos that are not yet
faked by generative approaches. In this paper, we first propose several
prominent eye and gaze features that deep fakes exhibit differently. Second, we
compile those features into signatures and analyze and compare those of real
and fake videos, formulating geometric, visual, metric, temporal, and spectral
variations. Third, we generalize this formulation to the deep fake detection
problem by a deep neural network, to classify any video in the wild as fake or
real. We evaluate our approach on several deep fake datasets, achieving 92.48%
accuracy on FaceForensics++, 80.0% on Deep Fakes (in the wild), 88.35% on
CelebDF, and 99.27% on DeeperForensics datasets. Our approach outperforms most
deep and biological fake detectors with complex network architectures without
the proposed gaze signatures. We conduct ablation studies involving different
features, architectures, sequence durations, and post-processing artifacts.</span>

                                        <span>The technology for Visual Odometry (VO) that estimates the position and
orientation of the moving object through analyzing the image sequences captured
by on-board cameras, has been well investigated with the rising interest in
autonomous driving. This paper studies monocular VO from the perspective of
Deep Learning (DL). Unlike most current learning-based methods, our approach,
called DeepAVO, is established on the intuition that features contribute
discriminately to different motion patterns. Specifically, we present a novel
four-branch network to learn the rotation and translation by leveraging
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus on different quadrants of optical
flow input. To enhance the ability of feature selection, we further introduce
an effective channel-spatial attention mechanism to force each branch to
explicitly distill related information for specific Frame to Frame (F2F) motion
estimation. Experiments on various datasets involving outdoor driving and
indoor walking scenarios show that the proposed DeepAVO outperforms the
state-of-the-art monocular methods by a large margin, demonstrating competitive
performance to the stereo VO algorithm and verifying promising potential for
generalization.</span>

piece in benchmarking human trajectory prediction models. In order to gain a
better understanding of the complexity of trajectory prediction tasks and
following the intuition, that more complex datasets contain more information,
an approach for quantifying the amount of information contained in a dataset

representation is obtained by first employing a non-trivial spatial sequence

                                        <span>Automated Parking is becoming a standard feature in modern vehicles. Existing
parking systems build a local map to be able to plan for maneuvering towards a
detected slot. Next generation parking systems have an use case where they
build a persistent map of the environment where the car is frequently parked,
say for example, home parking or office parking. The pre-built map helps in
re-localizing the vehicle better when its trying to park the next time. This is
achieved by augmenting the parking system with a Visual SLAM pipeline and the
feature is called trained trajectory parking in the automotive industry. In
this paper, we discuss the use cases, design and implementation of a trained
trajectory automated parking system. The proposed system is deployed on
commercial vehicles and the consumer application is illustrated in
\url{https://youtu.be/nRWF5KhyJZU}. The focus of this paper is on the

                                        <span>In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all
images in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size
which facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a
computational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance
due to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the
MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.</span>

                                        <span>The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is
strongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based
methods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved
cerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features
and are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background
clutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the
whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.

Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety
movement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from
short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative
information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy
screening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an
Australian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,
significantly outperforming existing competing methods with better
interpretability.</span>

                                        <span>In real-world scenarios, many factors may harm face recognition performance,
e.g., large pose, bad illumination,low resolution, blur and noise. To address
these challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces
to high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these
methods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In
this paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face
recognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to
restore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under
arbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a
well-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature
representation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and
restores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose
residual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module
(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its
real-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate
frontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a
strong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization
and face restoration.</span>

implications. For example, it plays a role in comfort, safety, posture, and
health. We present a method that infers contact pressure between a human body
and a mattress from a depth image. Specifically, we focus on using a depth
image from a downward facing camera to infer pressure on a body at rest in bed
occluded by bedding, which is directly applicable to the prevention of pressure
injuries in healthcare. Our approach involves augmenting a real dataset with
synthetic data generated via a soft-body physics simulation of a human body, a
mattress, a pressure sensing mat, and a blanket. We introduce a novel deep
network that we trained on an augmented dataset and evaluated with real data.
The network contains an embedded human body mesh model and uses a white-box
model of depth and pressure image generation. Our network successfully infers
body pose, outperforming prior work. It also infers contact pressure across a
3D mesh model of the human body, which is a novel capability, and does so in
the presence of occlusion from blankets.</span>

However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks
tobe able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited
computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning
techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning
pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et
al. (2018) has shown promising results when pruning at initialization. However,
for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned
networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one
layer from being fully pruned. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of Magnitude and Gradient based pruning at initialization
and training of sparse architectures. This allows us to propose novel
principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of NN
architectures.</span>

part because even though they are trained with datasets many orders of
magnitude smaller than the full population of possible images, they exhibit
sufficient generalization to be applicable to new and previously unseen data.
Although many have examined issues regarding generalization from several
perspectives, we wondered If a network is trained with a biased dataset that
misses particular samples corresponding to some defining domain attribute, can
it generalize to the full domain from which that training dataset was
extracted? It is certainly true that in vision, no current training set fully
captures all visual information and this may lead to Selection Bias. Here, we
try a novel approach in the tradition of the Thought Experiment. We run this
thought experiment on a real domain of visual objects that we can fully
characterize and look at specific gaps in training data and their impact on
performance requirements. Our thought experiment points to three conclusions:
first, that generalization behavior is dependent on how sufficiently the
particular dimensions of the domain are represented during training; second,
that the utility of any generalization is completely dependent on the
acceptable system error; and third, that specific visual features of objects,
such as pose orientations out of the imaging plane or colours, may not be
recoverable if not represented sufficiently in a training set. Any currently
observed generalization in modern deep learning networks may be more the result
of coincidental alignments and whose utility needs to be confirmed with respect
to a system&#x27;s performance specification. Our Thought Experiment Probe approach,
coupled with the resulting Bias Breakdown can be very informative towards
understanding the impact of biases.</span>

tackles two commonly encountered problems in biomedical imaging: Topological
consistency of the segmentation, and limited annotations. We propose a
topological score which measures both topological and geometric consistency
between the predicted and ground truth segmentations, applied for model
selection and validation. We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.
a U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised
U-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training
the network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm. This allows us
to utilize un-annotated data for training a representation that generalizes
across test data variability, in spite of our annotated training data having
very limited variation. Our contributions are validated on a challenging
segmentation task, locating tubular structures in the fetal pancreas from noisy
live imaging confocal microscopy.</span>

training data with 3D gaze annotations for in-the-wild and outdoor scenarios.
In contrast, videos of human interactions in unconstrained environments are
abundantly available and can be much more easily annotated with frame-level
activity labels. In this work, we tackle the previously unexplored problem of
weakly-supervised gaze estimation from videos of human interactions. We
leverage the insight that strong gaze-related geometric constraints exist when
people perform the activity of &quot;looking at each other&quot; (LAEO). To acquire
viable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm
along with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With
weak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity
datasets, we show significant improvements in (a) the accuracy of
semi-supervised gaze estimation and (b) cross-domain generalization on the
state-of-the-art physically unconstrained in-the-wild Gaze360 gaze estimation

when fine-grained features or in our case rarely occurring anomalies are to be
detected. Current contributions point to the problem of how high-dimensional
data can be fused. In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data
description algorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using
three different fusion techniques i.e. early fusion, late fusion, and late
fusion with multiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with
a denoising process to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves
the performance (ROC AUC &#x3D; 80\%). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset
that consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple
perspectives, with 5\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g. drill
holes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset
using images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard
MNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
exceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on addressing
multi-perspective anomaly detection in images by jointly using different

instances where depth sensors cannot be used, this distance has to be estimated
from RGB cameras. As opposed to cars, the task of estimating depth from
on-board mounted cameras is made complex on drones because of the lack of
constrains on motion during flights. %In the case of drones, this task is even
more complex than for car-mounted cameras since the camera motion is
unconstrained. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the distance of
objects seen by an on-board mounted camera by using its RGB video stream and
drone motion information. Our method is built upon a pyramidal convolutional
neural network architecture and uses time recurrence in pair with geometric
constraints imposed by motion to produce pixel-wise depth maps. %from a RGB
video stream of a camera attached to the drone In our architecture, each level
of the pyramid is designed to produce its own depth estimate based on past
observations and information provided by the previous level in the pyramid. We
introduce a spatial reprojection layer to maintain the spatio-temporal
consistency of the data between the levels. We analyse the performance of our
approach on Mid-Air, a public drone dataset featuring synthetic drone
trajectories recorded in a wide variety of unstructured outdoor environments.
Our experiments show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art depth
estimation methods and that the use of motion information is the main
contributing factor for this improvement. The code of our method is publicly
available on GitHub; see

the inefficiency and shortage of testing kits that offer accurate results in a
timely manner. An emerging popular technique, which adopts improvements made in
mobile ultrasound technology, allows for healthcare professionals to conduct
rapid screenings on a large scale. We present an image-based solution that aims
at automating the testing process which allows for rapid mass testing to be
conducted with or without a trained medical professional that can be applied to
rural environments and third world countries. Our contributions towards rapid
large-scale testing include a novel deep learning architecture capable of

                                        <span>Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts
are very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop
a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint
detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from
any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may
be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The
widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not
well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model
keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around
this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points
within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.
Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to
improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets
comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were
manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset
containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a
smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test
images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data
(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because
DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on
edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart
scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.</span>

                                        <span>There has been a rise in the use of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)
Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and
algorithms, which otherwise take a huge amount of resources if built from
scratch. As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it&#x27;s very
important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have
only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of
vision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods
and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s optical
character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world
settings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and
Microsoft Azure&#x27;s Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the
conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and
transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These
methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such
attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for
high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully
evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision
(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).
90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the
vision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s
optical character recognition. Complementing to current research, our results
provide simple but unconventional methods on robustness evaluation.</span>

real-world data and synthetic data. We mainly focus on four points, i.e.
training data, unsupervised domain-adaptive (UDA) training, post-processing,
model ensembling in this challenge. (1) Both cropping training data and using
synthetic data can help the model learn more discriminative features. (2) Since
there is a new scenario in the test set that dose not appear in the training
set, UDA methods perform well in the challenge. (3) Post-processing techniques
including re-ranking, image-to-track retrieval, inter-camera fusion, etc,
significantly improve final performance. (4) We ensemble CNN-based models and
transformer-based models which provide different representation diversity. With
aforementioned techniques, our method finally achieves 0.7445 mAP score,
yielding the first place in the competition. Codes are available at

restoration and enhancement. Generally, restoration quality has been improved
by building more and more convolutional block. However, these methods mostly
learn a specific model to handle all images and ignore difficulty diversity. In
other words, an area in the image with high frequency tend to lose more
information during compressing while an area with low frequency tends to lose
less. In this article, we adrress the efficiency issue in image SR by
incorporating a patch-wise rolling network(PRN) to content-adaptively recover
images according to difficulty levels. In contrast to existing studies that
ignore difficulty diversity, we adopt different stage of a neural network to
perform image restoration. In addition, we propose a rolling strategy that
utilizes the parameters of each stage more flexible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model not only shows a significant acceleration but also
maintain state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>Medical image segmentation is important for computer-aided diagnosis. Good
segmentation demands the model to see the big picture and fine details
simultaneously, i.e., to learn image features that incorporate large context
while keep high spatial resolutions. To approach this goal, the most widely
used methods -- U-Net and variants, extract and fuse multi-scale features.
However, the fused features still have small &quot;effective receptive fields&quot; with
a focus on local image cues, limiting their performance. In this work, we
propose Segtran, an alternative segmentation framework based on transformers,
which have unlimited &quot;effective receptive fields&quot; even at high feature
resolutions. The core of Segtran is a novel Squeeze-and-Expansion transformer:
a squeezed attention block regularizes the self attention of transformers, and
an expansion block learns diversified representations. Additionally, we propose
a new positional encoding scheme for transformers, imposing a continuity
inductive bias for images. Experiments were performed on 2D and 3D medical
image segmentation tasks: optic disc/cup segmentation in fundus images
(REFUGE&#x27;20 challenge), polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, and brain
tumor segmentation in MRI scans (BraTS&#x27;19 challenge). Compared with
representative existing methods, Segtran consistently achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy, and exhibited good cross-domain generalization
capabilities.</span>

                                        <span>The novel corona virus (Covid-19) has introduced significant challenges due
to its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,
there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease
diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective
radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a
sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep
leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that
utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt
models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training
dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the
transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging
domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this
circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network
(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR
images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits
important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using
graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is
not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of
extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three
class (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform
different benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned
drawbacks.</span>

                                        <span>Background and Objective: The new type of coronavirus is also called
COVID-19. It began to spread at the end of 2019 and has now spread across the
world. Until October 2020, It has infected around 37 million people and claimed
about 1 million lives. We propose a deep learning model that can help
radiologists and clinicians use chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19 cases and
show the diagnostic features of pneumonia. Methods: The approach in this study
is: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the
data set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our
deep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to
the DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly
improved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library
to mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more
quickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the
data with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training
respectively. At last, comparing two experimental results: among the 10 network
models with different structures, 7 network models have improved their effects
after using data enhancement, with an average improvement of 1% in recognition
accuracy. We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network
are 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs.
normal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by
2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective
results on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data
augmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the
sample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can
effectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.</span>

                                        <span>Learning based video compression attracts increasing attention in the past
few years. The previous hybrid coding approaches rely on pixel space operations
to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, which may suffer from inaccurate
motion estimation or less effective motion compensation. In this work, we
propose a feature-space video coding network (FVC) by performing all major
operations (i.e., motion estimation, motion compression, motion compensation
and residual compression) in the feature space. Specifically, in the proposed
deformable compensation module, we first apply motion estimation in the feature
space to produce motion information (i.e., the offset maps), which will be
compressed by using the auto-encoder style network. Then we perform motion
compensation by using deformable convolution and generate the predicted
feature. After that, we compress the residual feature between the feature from
the current frame and the predicted feature from our deformable compensation
module. For better frame reconstruction, the reference features from multiple
previous reconstructed frames are also fused by using the non-local attention
mechanism in the multi-frame feature fusion module. Comprehensive experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on four benchmark datasets including HEVC, UVG, VTL and MCL-JCV.</span>

the valuable information on tissue physiology that is contained in

technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into

Manually annotated multispectral photoacoustic imaging data are used as gold

automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and

line segmentation, unsupervised deep learning solutions are beginning to gain
popularity. In this paper, we present an unsupervised deep learning method that
embeds document image patches to a compact Euclidean space where distances
correspond to a coarse text line pattern similarity. Once this space has been
produced, text line segmentation can be easily implemented using standard
techniques with the embedded feature vectors. To train the model, we extract
random pairs of document image patches with the assumption that neighbour
patches contain a similar coarse trend of text lines, whereas if one of them is
rotated, they contain different coarse trends of text lines. Doing well on this
task requires the model to learn to recognize the text lines and their salient
parts. The benefit of our approach is zero manual labelling effort. We evaluate
the method qualitatively and quantitatively on several variants of text line
segmentation datasets to demonstrate its effectivity.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, collaborative learning proposed by Song and Chai has achieved
remarkable improvements in image classification tasks by simultaneously
training multiple classifier heads. However, huge memory footprints required by
such multi-head structures may hinder the training of large-capacity baseline
models. The natural question is how to achieve collaborative learning within a
single network without duplicating any modules. In this paper, we propose four
ways of collaborative learning among different parts of a single network with
negligible engineering efforts. To improve the robustness of the network, we
leverage the consistency of the output layer and intermediate layers for
training under the collaborative learning framework. Besides, the similarity of
intermediate representation and convolution kernel is also introduced to reduce
the reduce redundant in a neural network. Compared to the method of Song and
Chai, our framework further considers the collaboration inside a single model
and takes smaller overhead. Extensive experiments on Cifar-10, Cifar-100,
ImageNet32 and STL-10 corroborate the effectiveness of these four ways
separately while combining them leads to further improvements. In particular,
test errors on the STL-10 dataset are decreased by $9.28\%$ and $5.45\%$ for
ResNet-18 and VGG-16 respectively. Moreover, our method is proven to be robust
to label noise with experiments on Cifar-10 dataset. For example, our method
has $3.53\%$ higher performance under $50\%$ noise ratio setting.</span>

data-limited situations. While most previous works merely focus on the
performance on few-shot categories, we claim that detecting all classes is
crucial as test samples may contain any instances in realistic applications,
which requires the few-shot detector to learn new concepts without forgetting.
Through analysis on transfer learning based methods, some neglected but
beneficial properties are utilized to design a simple yet effective few-shot
detector, Retentive R-CNN. It consists of Bias-Balanced RPN to debias the
pretrained RPN and Re-detector to find few-shot class objects without
forgetting previous knowledge. Extensive experiments on few-shot detection
benchmarks show that Retentive R-CNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on overall performance among all settings as it can achieve competitive
results on few-shot classes and does not degrade the base class performance at
all. Our approach has demonstrated that the long desired never-forgetting
learner is available in object detection.</span>

                                        <span>Object goal navigation aims to steer an agent towards a target object based
on observations of the agent. It is of pivotal importance to design effective
visual representations of the observed scene in determining navigation actions.
In this paper, we introduce a Visual Transformer Network (VTNet) for learning
informative visual representation in navigation. VTNet is a highly effective
structure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First,
the relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited;
Second, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so
that directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also
develop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with
navigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning. In a
nutshell, VTNet embeds object and region features with their location cues as
spatial-aware descriptors and then incorporates all the encoded descriptors
through attention operations to achieve informative representation for
navigation. Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the
correlations between visual observations and navigation actions. For example,
an agent would prioritize &quot;turning right&quot; over &quot;turning left&quot; when the visual
representation emphasizes on the right side of activation map. Experiments in
the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that VTNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments.</span>

the requirement of the labeled images, we propose ColorCount, a novel CNN-based
approach by combining self-supervised transfer colorization learning and global
prior classification to leverage the abundantly available unlabeled data. The
self-supervised colorization branch learns the semantics and surface texture of
the image by using its color components as pseudo labels. The classification
branch extracts global group priors by learning correlations among image
clusters. Their fused resultant discriminative features (global priors,
semantics and textures) provide ample priors for counting, hence significantly
reducing the requirement of labeled images. We conduct extensive experiments on
four challenging benchmarks. ColorCount achieves much better performance as
compared with other unsupervised approaches. Its performance is close to the

                                        <span>We assume that substances in the world are represented by two types of
concepts, namely substance concepts and classification concepts, the former
instrumental to (visual) perception, the latter to (language based)
classification. Based on this distinction, we introduce a general methodology
for building lexico-semantic hierarchies of substance concepts, where nodes are
annotated with the media, e.g.,videos or photos, from which substance concepts
are extracted, and are associated with the corresponding classification
concepts. The methodology is based on Ranganathan&#x27;s original faceted approach,
contextualized to the problem of classifying substance concepts. The key
novelty is that the hierarchy is built exploiting the visual properties of
substance concepts, while the linguistically defined properties of
classification concepts are only used to describe substance concepts. The
validity of the approach is exemplified by providing some highlights of an
ongoing project whose goal is to build a large scale multimedia multilingual
concept hierarchy.</span>

                                        <span>Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction.
Most existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the
relations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well
learned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human
motion&#x27;s balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part
to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions
are sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called
balance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to
characterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build
new joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and
thus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the
BA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,
mainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and
Multi-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global
Coordination Extractor (GCE) and Local Interaction Extractor (LIE). The former
presents the global coordination of all joints, and the latter encodes local
interactions between joint pairs. The MTDE is designed to extract dynamic
information from raw position information for effective prediction. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.</span>

                                        <span>Camouflaged objects attempt to conceal their texture into the background and
discriminating them from the background is hard even for human beings. The main
objective of this paper is to explore the camouflaged object segmentation
problem, namely, segmenting the camouflaged object(s) for a given image. This
problem has not been well studied in spite of a wide range of potential
applications including the preservation of wild animals and the discovery of
new species, surveillance systems, search-and-rescue missions in the event of
natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes. This paper
addresses a new challenging problem of camouflaged object segmentation. To
address this problem, we provide a new image dataset of camouflaged objects for
benchmarking purposes. In addition, we propose a general end-to-end network,
called the Anabranch Network, that leverages both classification and
segmentation tasks. Different from existing networks for segmentation, our
proposed network possesses the second branch for classification to predict the
probability of containing camouflaged object(s) in an image, which is then
fused into the main branch for segmentation to boost up the segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on the newly built dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our network using various fully convolutional
networks. \url{https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/camo}</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research
interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation -- describing a shape as
a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point
clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used
in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential
and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for
existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and
natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.
We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and
random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset
consisting of 179,133 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made
this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.</span>

                                        <span>Registration networks have shown great application potentials in medical
image analysis. However, supervised training methods have a great demand for
large and high-quality labeled datasets, which is time-consuming and sometimes
impractical due to data sharing issues. Unsupervised image registration
algorithms commonly employ intensity-based similarity measures as loss
functions without any manual annotations. These methods estimate the
parameterized transformations between pairs of moving and fixed images through
the optimization of the network parameters during training. However, these
methods become less effective when the image quality varies, e.g., some images
are corrupted by substantial noise or artifacts. In this work, we propose a
novel approach based on a low-rank representation, i.e., Regnet-LRR, to tackle
the problem. We project noisy images into a noise-free low-rank space, and then
compute the similarity between the images. Based on the low-rank similarity
measure, we train the registration network to predict the dense deformation
fields of noisy image pairs. We highlight that the low-rank projection is
reformulated in a way that the registration network can successfully update
gradients. With two tasks, i.e., cardiac and abdominal intra-modality
registration, we demonstrate that the low-rank representation can boost the
generalization ability and robustness of models as well as bring significant
improvements in noisy data registration scenarios.</span>

image captioning and information retrieval, and have achieved remarkable
improvements due to its capability to learn fine-grained relevance across
different modalities. However, existing attention models could be sub-optimal
and lack preciseness because there is no direct supervision involved during
training. In this work, we propose Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and
Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints to address such limitation.
These constraints supervise the training of attention models in a contrastive
learning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. Additionally,
we introduce three metrics, namely Attention Precision, Recall and F1-Score, to
quantitatively evaluate the attention quality. We evaluate the proposed
constraints with cross-modal retrieval (image-text matching) task. The
experiments on both Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that integrating
these attention constraints into two state-of-the-art attention-based models
improves the model performance in terms of both retrieval accuracy and

                                        <span>Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often
carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the
image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat
image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,
specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these
superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model
that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial
information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with
relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is
learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a &#x60;hybrid&#x27; loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:
COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint
Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel

                                        <span>Recently, plenty of work has tried to introduce transformers into computer
vision tasks, with good results. Unlike classic convolution networks, which
extract features within a local receptive field, transformers can adaptively
aggregate similar features from a global view using self-attention mechanism.
For object detection, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) proposes feature
interaction across layers and proves its extremely importance. However, its
interaction is still in a local manner, which leaves a lot of room for
improvement. Since transformer was originally designed for NLP tasks, adapting
processing subject directly from text to image will cause unaffordable
computation and space overhead. In this paper, we utilize a linearized
attention function to overcome above problems and build a novel architecture,
named Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN), which proposes a
global content extraction module and deeply combines with FPN through light
linear transformers. What&#x27;s more, light transformers can further make the
application of multi-head attention mechanism easier. Most importantly, our
CA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive
experiments on the challenging COCO object detection dataset demonstrated that
our CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive baselines without bells and
whistles. Code will be made publicly available.</span>

for accuracy and speed to exceed anchor-based object detection. Therefore, two
issues are mainly studied in this article: (1) How to let the backbone network
in the anchor-free object detection model learn feature extraction? (2) How to
make better use of the feature pyramid network? In order to solve the above
problems, Experiments show that our model has a certain improvement in accuracy
compared with the current popular detection models on the COCO dataset, the
designed attention mechanism module can capture contextual information well,
improve detection accuracy, and use sepc network to help balance abstract and
detailed information, and reduce the problem of semantic gap in the feature
pyramid network. Whether it is anchor-based network model YOLOv3, Faster RCNN,
or anchor-free network model Foveabox, FSAF, FCOS. Our optimal model can get
39.5% COCO AP under the background of ResNet50.</span>

familiar environment, can we recognize what the person is doing and identify
where the action occurs in the 3D space? We address this challenging problem of
jointly recognizing and localizing actions of a mobile user on a known 3D map
from egocentric videos. To this end, we propose a novel deep probabilistic
model. Our model takes the inputs of a Hierarchical Volumetric Representation
(HVR) of the environment and an egocentric video, infers the 3D action location
as a latent variable, and recognizes the action based on the video and
contextual cues surrounding its potential locations. To evaluate our model, we
conduct extensive experiments on a newly collected egocentric video dataset, in
which both human naturalistic actions and photo-realistic 3D environment
reconstructions are captured. Our method demonstrates strong results on both
action recognition and 3D action localization across seen and unseen
environments. We believe our work points to an exciting research direction in
the intersection of egocentric vision, and 3D scene understanding.</span>

optical character recognition (OCR) system. Most available image denoising
methods are supervised where the pairs of noisy/clean pages are required.
However, this assumption is rarely met in real settings. Besides, there is no
single model that can remove various noise types from documents. Here, we
propose a unified end-to-end unsupervised deep learning model, for the first
time, that can effectively remove multiple types of noise, including salt \&amp;
pepper noise, blurred and/or faded text, as well as watermarks from documents
at various levels of intensity. We demonstrate that the proposed model

                                        <span>With the advent of big data across multiple high-impact applications, we are
often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data
usually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,
thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although
state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with
sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to
obtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these
techniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich
unlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified
heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple
types of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the
proposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual
information of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the
hidden representation of two views of the same sample. Experimental results on
real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the
proposed method modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.</span>

species is not always possible due to the lack of 3D data. We present a method
to capture new species using an articulated template and images of that
species. In this work, we focus mainly on birds. Although birds represent
almost twice the number of species as mammals, no accurate shape model is
available. To capture a novel species, we first fit the articulated template to
each training sample. By disentangling pose and shape, we learn a shape space
that captures variation both among species and within each species from image
evidence. We learn models of multiple species from the CUB dataset, and
contribute new species-specific and multi-species shape models that are useful
for downstream reconstruction tasks. Using a low-dimensional embedding, we show
that our learned 3D shape space better reflects the phylogenetic relationships
among birds than learned perceptual features.</span>

                                        <span>Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF)
reconstruction applicable to diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth
phase variations.

Methods: Based on an unrolled proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network
architecture is derived which alternates between data consistency operations
and regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order to exploit
correlations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed
under consideration of permutation-equivariance. The proposed method is trained
on DW liver data of 60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and
prospectively sub-sampled data of different anatomies and resolutions. In
addition, the benefits of using a recurrent network over other unrolling
strategies is investigated.

Results: Conventional PF techniques can be significantly outperformed in
terms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual image quality. The
proposed method is able to generalize well to brain data with contrasts and
resolution not present in the training set. The reduction in echo time (TE)
associated with prospective PF-sampling enables DW imaging with higher signal.
Also, the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution can be compensated
for. It can be shown that unrolling by means of a recurrent network produced
better results than using a weight-shared network or a cascade of networks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data
is feasible even at strong PF factors in applications with severe phase
variations. Since the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the
phase but uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of
conventional PF methods can be avoided.</span>

                                        <span>While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation
has recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,
existing approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were
gathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily
outfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the
demonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning
for vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this
work, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the
Imitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a
robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we
introduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for
Autonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies
from a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.
We evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA
not only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation
policies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a
wheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment
using a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.</span>

                                        <span>Despite the empirical success of neural architecture search (NAS) in deep
learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

                                        <span>Many computer systems for calculating the proper organization of memory are
among the most critical issues. Using a tier cache memory (along with branching
prediction) is an effective means of increasing modern multi-core processors&#x27;
performance. Designing high-performance processors is a complex task and
requires preliminary verification and analysis of the model level, usually used
in analytical and simulation modeling. The refinement of extreme programming is
an unfortunate challenge. Few experts disagree with the synthesis of access
points. This article demonstrates that Internet QoS and 16-bit architectures
are always incompatible, but it&#x27;s the same situation for write-back caches. The
solution to this problem can be implemented by analyzing simulation models of
different complexity in combination with the analytical evaluation of
individual algorithms. This work is devoted to designing a multi-parameter
simulation model of a multi-process for evaluating the performance of cache
memory algorithms and the optimality of the structure. Optimization of the
structures and algorithms of the cache memory allows you to accelerate the
interaction of the memory process and improve the performance of the entire
system.</span>

                                        <span>Interactive news recommendation has been launched and attracted much
attention recently. In this scenario, user&#x27;s behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user&#x27;s preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user&#x27;s demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user&#x27;s interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.</span>

                                        <span>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable the traditional recommender
systems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes
through interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely
adopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what
attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at
each conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one
or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated
conversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and
generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In
the light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three
decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to
systematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop
a dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action
at each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items.
Further, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action
selection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the
preference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS
datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method
not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances
the scalability and stability of CRS.</span>

conceptual schema is known to be a non-trivial problem. In particular the
formulation of ad-hoc queries is a major problem in such contexts. Existing
approaches for tackling this problem include graphical query interfaces, query
by navigation, query by construction, and point to point queries. In this
report we propose an adoption of the query by navigation mechanism that is
especially geared towards the InfoAssistant product. Query by navigation is
based on ideas from the information retrieval world, in particular on the
stratified hypermedia architecture. When using our approach to the formulations
of queries, a user will first formulate a number of simple queries
corresponding to linear paths through the information structure. The
formulation of the linear paths is the result of the {\em explorative phase} of
the query formulation. Once users have specified a number of these linear
paths, they may combine them to form more complex queries. Examples of such
combinations are: concatenation, union, intersection and selection. This last
process is referred to as {\em query by construction}, and is the {\em
constructive phase} of the query formulation process.</span>

of symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations
(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical
SAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian
distribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel
data-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their
discretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data
compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss
and mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented
for high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is
shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic
process that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate
piecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional
information loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed
representations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX
method. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets
demonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an
alternative data-driven SAX variant.</span>

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users&#x27; demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.</span>

                                        <span>Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental building block in
information retrieval with graph-based indices being the current
state-of-the-art and widely used in the industry. Recent advances in
graph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point
datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity
machine with an SSD.

However, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that
cannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world
scenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email, or a news index). To
overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates
into such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be
prohibitively expensive.

In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects
corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search
performance. Using update rules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a
system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and
limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes
and searches per second each, while retaining $&gt;95\%$ 5-recall@5. This
represents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices
when compared to existing methods.</span>

                                        <span>An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural
document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -
e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based
document ranking models.</span>

                                        <span>Learning from implicit feedback is one of the most common cases in the
application of recommender systems. Generally speaking, interacted examples are
considered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted
ones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A
noisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative
user preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of
unawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference.
Conventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to
sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose probabilistic and
variational recommendation denoising for implicit feedback. Through an
empirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar
predictions on clean examples which denote the real user preference, while the
predictions on noisy examples vary much more across different models. Motivated
by this observation, we propose denoising with probabilistic inference (DPI)
which aims to minimize the KL-divergence between the real user preference
distributions parameterized by two recommendation models while maximize the
likelihood of data observation. We then show that DPI recovers the evidence
lower bound of an variational auto-encoder when the real user preference is
considered as the latent variables. This leads to our second learning framework
denoising with variational autoencoder (DVAE). We employ the proposed DPI and
DVAE on four state-of-the-art recommendation models and conduct experiments on
three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DPI and DVAE
significantly improve recommendation performance compared with normal training
and other denoising methods. Codes will be open-sourced.</span>

                                        <span>In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all
images in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size
which facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a
computational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance
due to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the
MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.</span>

samples and among features. The Kronecker sum or the Cartesian product of two
graphs, each modeling dependencies across features and across samples, has been
used as an inverse covariance matrix for a matrix-variate Gaussian
distribution, as an alternative to a Kronecker-product inverse covariance
matrix, due to its more intuitive sparse structure. However, the existing
methods for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse covariance estimation are limited in
that they do not scale to more than a few hundred features and samples and that
the unidentifiable parameters pose challenges in estimation. In this paper, we
introduce EiGLasso, a highly scalable method for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse
covariance estimation, based on Newton&#x27;s method combined with
eigendecomposition of the two graphs for exploiting the structure of Kronecker
sum. EiGLasso further reduces computation time by approximating the Hessian
based on the eigendecomposition of the sample and feature graphs. EiGLasso
achieves quadratic convergence with the exact Hessian and linear convergence
with the approximate Hessian. We describe a simple new approach to estimating
the unidentifiable parameters that generalizes the existing methods. On
simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that EiGLasso achieves two to
three orders-of-magnitude speed-up compared to the existing methods.</span>

learning, bandit learning and reinforcement learning have been applied to
queueing systems supported by increasing role of information in decision
making. We present observations and new results that help rationalize the

We prove that the MaxWeight and BackPressure policies are an application of

with adversarial learning. We then discuss the requirements of statistical
learning for service parameter estimation. As an example, we show how queue
size regret can be bounded when applying a perceptron algorithm to classify
service. Next, we discuss the role of state information in improved decision
making. Here we contrast the roles of epistemic information (information on
uncertain parameters) and aleatoric information (information on an uncertain

Manually labeling data is a very expensive and daunting task. This calls for
unsupervised learning techniques that are powerful enough to achieve comparable
results as semi-supervised/supervised techniques. Contrastive self-supervised
learning has emerged as a powerful direction, in some cases outperforming
supervised techniques. In this study, we propose, SelfGNN, a novel contrastive
self-supervised graph neural network (GNN) without relying on explicit
contrastive terms. We leverage Batch Normalization, which introduces implicit
contrastive terms, without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, as data
augmentation is key in contrastive learning, we introduce four feature
augmentation (FA) techniques for graphs. Though graph topological augmentation
(TA) is commonly used, our empirical findings show that FA perform as good as
TA. Moreover, FA incurs no computational overhead, unlike TA, which often has
O(N^3) time complexity, N-number of nodes. Our empirical evaluation on seven
publicly available real-world data shows that, SelfGNN is powerful and leads to
a performance comparable with SOTA supervised GNNs and always better than SOTA
semi-supervised and unsupervised GNNs. The source code is available at

Spanish, and Turkish. We report results of 0.8415 F1 macro for Bengali in
TRAC-2 shared task, 0.8532 F1 macro for Danish and 0.8701 F1 macro for Greek in
OffensEval 2020, 0.8568 F1 macro for Hindi in HASOC 2019 shared task and 0.7513
F1 macro for Spanish in in SemEval-2019 Task 5 (HatEval) showing that our
approach compares favourably to the best systems submitted to recent shared
tasks on these three languages. Additionally, we report competitive performance
on Arabic, and Turkish using the training and development sets of OffensEval
2020 shared task. The results for all languages confirm the robustness of
cross-lingual contextual embeddings and transfer learning for this task.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning enables multiple parties to collaboratively learn a model
without exchanging their data. While most existing federated learning
algorithms need many rounds to converge, one-shot federated learning (i.e.,
federated learning with a single communication round) is a promising approach
to make federated learning applicable in cross-silo setting in practice.
However, existing one-shot algorithms only support specific models and do not
provide any privacy guarantees, which significantly limit the applications in
practice. In this paper, we propose a practical one-shot federated learning
algorithm named FedKT. By utilizing the knowledge transfer technique, FedKT can
be applied to any classification models and can flexibly achieve differential
privacy guarantees. Our experiments on various tasks show that FedKT can
significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art federated learning
algorithms with a single communication round.</span>

                                        <span>Policies trained in simulation often fail when transferred to the real world
due to the &#x60;reality gap&#x27; where the simulator is unable to accurately capture
the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to
tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and
engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to
learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too
conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system
parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world
without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to
reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively
shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system
parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of
observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the
given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate
the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in
both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement
over naive domain randomization. Project videos and code at

produce desirable solutions than other comparable networks? In this paper, we
provide a new angle to study such issues under the setting of a fixed number of
model parameters which in general is the most dominant cost factor. We
introduce a notion of variability and show that it correlates positively to the
activation ratio and negatively to a phenomenon called {Collapse to Constants}
(or C2C), which is closely related but not identical to the phenomenon commonly
known as vanishing gradient. Experiments on a styled model problem empirically
verify that variability is indeed a key performance indicator for fully
connected neural networks. The insights gained from this variability study will
help the design of new and effective neural network architectures.</span>

measurements of multiple sparse samples in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. These samples can
be partitioned into $\ell$ groups, with samples having the same support
belonging to the same group. For a given budget of $m$ measurements per sample,
the goal is to recover the $\ell$ underlying supports, in the absence of the
knowledge of group labels. We study this problem with a focus on the
measurement-constrained regime where $m$ is smaller than the support size $k$
of each sample. We design a two-step procedure that estimates the union of the
underlying supports first, and then uses a spectral algorithm to estimate the
individual supports. Our proposed estimator can recover the supports with $m&lt;k$
measurements per sample, from $\tilde{O}(k^{4}\ell^{4}/m^{4})$ samples. Our
guarantees hold for a general, generative model assumption on the samples and

learning ensemble for detecting COVID-19 infection, combining slice-based (2D)

CT slice independently, combining them to obtain the patient-level decision via
different methods (averaging and long-short term memory networks). The 3D
system takes the whole CT volume to arrive to the patient-level decision in one
step. A new high resolution chest CT scan dataset, called the IST-C dataset, is
also collected in this work. The proposed ensemble, called IST-CovNet, obtains
90.80% accuracy and 0.95 AUC score overall on the IST-C dataset in detecting
COVID-19 among normal controls and other types of lung pathologies; and 93.69%
accuracy and 0.99 AUC score on the publicly available MosMed dataset that

                                        <span>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs&#x27; performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>Large ride-hailing platforms, such as DiDi, Uber and Lyft, connect tens of
thousands of vehicles in a city to millions of ride demands throughout the day,
providing great promises for improving transportation efficiency through the
tasks of order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. Existing studies,
however, usually consider the two tasks in simplified settings that hardly
address the complex interactions between the two, the real-time fluctuations
between supply and demand, and the necessary coordinations due to the
large-scale nature of the problem. In this paper we propose a unified
value-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both tasks. At the
center of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated
continuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform
transactions. To improve the sample-efficiency and the robustness, we further
propose a novel periodic ensemble method combining the fast online learning
with a large-scale offline training scheme that leverages the abundant
historical driver trajectory data. This allows the proposed framework to adapt
quickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent
patterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed
vehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably
improvements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks. Particularly,
V1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning
tracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results
on improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Chest X-rays of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are frequently
obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest
X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal
shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,
and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To
accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available
chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage
existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection &quot;chest X-ray&quot;
images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an
automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays
comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest
X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On
a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model
achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a
dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50
projections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines
with limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity
quantification on chest X-rays.</span>

                                        <span>While programming is one of the most broadly applicable skills in modern
society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted
settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary
natural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this
specification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,
we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our
benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line
solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large
language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the
prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as
GPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,
so we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As
the social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming
years, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking
advancements.</span>

                                        <span>In recommendation systems, the existence of the missing-not-at-random (MNAR)
problem results in the selection bias issue, degrading the recommendation
performance ultimately. A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing
entries from the so-called &quot;exposure&quot; perspective, i.e., modeling how an item
is exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic
models or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the
missing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how
the ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we
propose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding
in Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In
general, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors
(e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network&#x27;s perspective.
Particularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social
network confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We
also develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning
to retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize
well on the rating prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate
that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

recognition becomes a key component to deliver relevant search results. Errors
introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) lead to irrelevant search
results returned to the user, thus causing user dissatisfaction. In this paper,
we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space
without depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to
system constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run
on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several
proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making
internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis
showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries
is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR
systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant
improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in
one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as
complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not
be frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts.</span>

the common network threats nowadays have the characteristics of varieties and
variation. Considering the serious imbalance of intrusion detection datasets
will result in low classification performance on attack behaviors of small
sample size and difficulty to detect network attacks accurately and
efficiently, using Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) method to balance
datasets was proposed in this paper. In addition, Random Forest algorithm was
used to train intrusion detection classifiers. Through the comparative
experiment of Intrusion detection on CICIDS 2017 dataset, it is found that
ADASYN with Random Forest performs better. Based on the experimental results,
the improvement of precision, recall, F1 scores and AUC values after ADASYN is
then analyzed. Experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to
intrusion detection with large data, and can effectively improve the
classification accuracy of network attack behaviors. Compared with traditional
machine learning models, it has better performance, generalization ability and
robustness.</span>

model that considers real-world phenomena in many recommender systems: (i) the
learning agent cannot pull the arms by itself and thus has to offer rewards to
users to incentivize arm-pulling indirectly; and (ii) if users with specific
arm preferences are well rewarded, they induce a &quot;self-reinforcing&quot; effect in
the sense that they will attract more users of similar arm preferences. Besides
addressing the tradeoff of exploration and exploitation, another key feature of
this new MAB model is to balance reward and incentivizing payment. The goal of
the agent is to maximize the total reward over a fixed time horizon $T$ with a
low total payment. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: (i) We propose
a new MAB model with random arm selection that considers the relationship of
users&#x27; self-reinforcing preferences and incentives; and (ii) We leverage the
properties of a multi-color Polya urn with nonlinear feedback model to propose
two MAB policies termed &quot;At-Least-$n$ Explore-Then-Commit&quot; and &quot;UCB-List&quot;. We
prove that both policies achieve $O(log T)$ expected regret with $O(log T)$
expected payment over a time horizon $T$. We conduct numerical simulations to
demonstrate and verify the performances of these two policies and study their
robustness under various settings.</span>

                                        <span>Prostate cancer is a very common disease among adult men. One in seven
Canadian men is diagnosed with this cancer in their lifetime. Super-Resolution
(SR) can facilitate early diagnosis and potentially save many lives. In this
paper, a robust and accurate model is proposed for prostate MRI SR. The model
is trained on the Prostate-Diagnosis and PROSTATEx datasets. The proposed model
outperformed the state-of-the-art prostate SR model in all similarity metrics
with notable margins. A new task-specific similarity assessment is introduced
as well. A classifier is trained for severe cancer detection and the drop in
the accuracy of this model when dealing with super-resolved images is used for
evaluating the ability of medical detail reconstruction of the SR models. The
proposed SR model is a step towards an efficient and accurate general medical
SR platform.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to improve software reliability.
Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) techniques have been used to fix
software bugs automatically. While promising, these approaches have two major
limitations. Their search space often does not contain the correct fix, and
their search strategy ignores software knowledge such as strict code syntax.
Due to these limitations, existing NMT-based techniques underperform the best
template-based approaches.

We propose CURE, a new NMT-based APR technique with three major novelties.
First, CURE pre-trains a programming language (PL) model on a large software
codebase to learn developer-like source code before the APR task. Second, CURE
designs a new code-aware search strategy that finds more correct fixes by
focusing on compilable patches and patches that are close in length to the
buggy code. Finally, CURE uses a subword tokenization technique to generate a
smaller search space that contains more correct fixes.

Our evaluation on two widely-used benchmarks shows that CURE correctly fixes
57 Defects4J bugs and 26 QuixBugs bugs, outperforming all existing APR
techniques on both benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Determining the noise parameters of a Kalman Filter (KF) has been studied for
decades. A huge body of research focuses on the task of estimation of the noise
under various conditions, since precise noise estimation is considered
equivalent to minimization of the filtering errors. However, we show that even
a small violation of the KF assumptions can significantly modify the effective
noise, breaking the equivalence between the tasks and making noise estimation
an inferior strategy. We show that such violations are very common, and are
often not trivial to handle or even notice. Consequentially, we argue that a
robust solution is needed - rather than choosing a dedicated model per problem.
To that end, we apply gradient-based optimization to the filtering errors
directly, with relation to a simple and efficient parameterization of the
symmetric and positive-definite parameters of KF. In radar tracking and video
tracking, we show that the optimization improves both the accuracy of KF and
its robustness to design decisions. In addition, we demonstrate how an
optimized neural network model can seem to reduce the errors significantly
compared to a KF - and how this reduction vanishes once the KF is optimized
similarly. This indicates how complicated models can be wrongly identified as
superior to KF, while in fact they were merely more optimized.</span>

region is crucial for decision-makers wishing to reduce the impact of pollution
on public health through active measures (e.g. temporary traffic closures). In
this study, we present a machine learning approach applied to the forecast of
the day-ahead maximum value of the ozone concentration for several geographical
locations in southern Switzerland. Due to the low density of measurement
stations and to the complex orography of the use case terrain, we adopted
feature selection methods instead of explicitly restricting relevant features
to a neighbourhood of the prediction sites, as common in spatio-temporal
forecasting methods. We then used Shapley values to assess the explainability
of the learned models in terms of feature importance and feature interactions
in relation to ozone predictions; our analysis suggests that the trained models
effectively learned explanatory cross-dependencies among atmospheric variables.
Finally, we show how weighting observations helps in increasing the accuracy of
the forecasts for specific ranges of ozone&#x27;s daily peak values.</span>

                                        <span>Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style characteristics of one
image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches
commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face
limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial
locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial
success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations,
this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and
normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name
Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially
a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through
attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN
into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced
stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform
for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces
visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.</span>

                                        <span>The study of multi-type Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is fundamental for
understanding biological processes from a systematic perspective and revealing
disease mechanisms. Existing methods suffer from significant performance
degradation when tested in unseen dataset. In this paper, we investigate the
problem and find that it is mainly attributed to the poor performance for
inter-novel-protein interaction prediction. However, current evaluations
overlook the inter-novel-protein interactions, and thus fail to give an
instructive assessment. As a result, we propose to address the problem from
both the evaluation and the methodology. Firstly, we design a new evaluation
framework that fully respects the inter-novel-protein interactions and gives
consistent assessment across datasets. Secondly, we argue that correlations
between proteins must provide useful information for analysis of novel
proteins, and based on this, we propose a graph neural network based method
(GNN-PPI) for better inter-novel-protein interaction prediction. Experimental
results on real-world datasets of different scales demonstrate that GNN-PPI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods, especially
for the inter-novel-protein interaction prediction.</span>

better tools for adaptation. Floods, for example, are the most frequent natural
disaster, and better tools for flood risk communication could increase the
support for flood-resilient infrastructure development. Our work aims to enable
more visual communication of large-scale climate impacts via visualizing the
output of coastal flood models as satellite imagery. We propose the first deep
learning pipeline to ensure physical-consistency in synthetic visual satellite
imagery. We advanced a state-of-the-art GAN called pix2pixHD, such that it
produces imagery that is physically-consistent with the output of an
expert-validated storm surge model (NOAA SLOSH). By evaluating the imagery
relative to physics-based flood maps, we find that our proposed framework
outperforms baseline models in both physical-consistency and photorealism. We
envision our work to be the first step towards a global visualization of how
climate change shapes our landscape. Continuing on this path, we show that the
proposed pipeline generalizes to visualize arctic sea ice melt. We also publish
a dataset of over 25k labelled image-pairs to study image-to-image translation
in Earth observation.</span>

                                        <span>Data-driven individualized decision making has recently received increasing
research interests. Most existing methods rely on the assumption of no
unmeasured confounding, which unfortunately cannot be ensured in practice
especially in observational studies. Motivated by the recent proposed proximal
causal inference, we develop several proximal learning approaches to estimating
optimal individualized treatment regimes (ITRs) in the presence of unmeasured
confounding. In particular, we establish several identification results for
different classes of ITRs, exhibiting the trade-off between the risk of making
untestable assumptions and the value function improvement in decision making.
Based on these results, we propose several classification-based approaches to
finding a variety of restricted in-class optimal ITRs and develop their
theoretical properties. The appealing numerical performance of our proposed
methods is demonstrated via an extensive simulation study and one real data
application.</span>

                                        <span>Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences
from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error
rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a
sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine
translation by a large margin.</span>

                                        <span>(Artificial) neural networks have become increasingly popular in mechanics as
means to accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as
universal models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major
disadvantage of neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are
challenging to interpret and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled
as black boxes, and their results often elude human interpretation. In
mechanics, the new and active field of physics-informed neural networks
attempts to mitigate this disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the
basis of mechanical knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and
more complex neural networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions
could be explained. However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural
network parameters remain mysterious.

Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step
towards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on
mechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence
approach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their
high-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis
decorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows
the comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is
supported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the
best neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of
three case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,
elastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can
help identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize
new materials.</span>

solar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground
are used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the
electricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the
Sun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a
reference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking
methods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires
access to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an
image-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is
visible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We
validate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA&#x27;s
lab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth
Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size.</span>

design an appropriate end-to-end learning pipeline. Neuro-Symbolic Learning,
divide the process into sub-symbolic perception and symbolic reasoning, trying
to utilise data-driven machine learning and knowledge-driven reasoning
simultaneously. However, they suffer from the exponential computational
complexity within the interface between these two components, where the
sub-symbolic learning model lacks direct supervision, and the symbolic model
lacks accurate input facts. Hence, most of them assume the existence of a
strong symbolic knowledge base and only learn the perception model while
avoiding a crucial problem: where does the knowledge come from? In this paper,
we present Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning ($Meta_{Abd}$) that unites
abduction and induction to learn neural networks and induce logic theories
jointly from raw data. Experimental results demonstrate that $Meta_{Abd}$ not
only outperforms the compared systems in predictive accuracy and data
efficiency but also induces logic programs that can be re-used as background
knowledge in subsequent learning tasks. To the best of our knowledge,
$Meta_{Abd}$ is the first system that can jointly learn neural networks from

industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number
of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to
manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different
graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine
learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine
learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community.
Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily
focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search
(NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to
automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first
dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our
insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning.

symptoms shown by patients are not consistent, making it difficult to diagnose
in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although
researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis

to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness
needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms
clinical application. To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of
patients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and
diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning
framework using multi-source data, which can extend any traditional machine
learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or

aspire to make the most of their data, demand for machine learning tools has
spurred researchers to explore the possibilities of automated machine learning
(AutoML). AutoML tools aim to make machine learning accessible for non-machine
learning experts (domain experts), to improve the efficiency of machine
learning, and to accelerate machine learning research. But although automation
and efficiency are among AutoML&#x27;s main selling points, the process still
requires human involvement at a number of vital steps, including understanding
the attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating
a suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning
technique. These steps often require a prolonged back-and-forth that makes this
process inefficient for domain experts and data scientists alike, and keeps
so-called AutoML systems from being truly automatic. In this review article, we
introduce a new classification system for AutoML systems, using a seven-tiered
schematic to distinguish these systems based on their level of autonomy. We
begin by describing what an end-to-end machine learning pipeline actually looks
like, and which subtasks of the machine learning pipeline have been automated
so far. We highlight those subtasks which are still done manually - generally
by a data scientist - and explain how this limits domain experts&#x27; access to
machine learning. Next, we introduce our novel level-based taxonomy for AutoML
systems and define each level according to the scope of automation support
provided. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for the future, pinpointing the
research required to further automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline
and discussing important challenges that stand in the way of this ambitious
goal.</span>

                                        <span>This article addresses several fundamental issues associated with the
approximation theory of neural networks, including the characterization of
approximation spaces, the determination of the metric entropy of these spaces,
and approximation rates of neural networks. For any activation function
$\sigma$, we show that the largest Banach space of functions which can be
efficiently approximated by the corresponding shallow neural networks is the
space whose norm is given by the gauge of the closed convex hull of the set
$\{\pm\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}$. We characterize this space for the ReLU$^k$
and cosine activation functions and, in particular, show that the resulting
gauge space is equivalent to the spectral Barron space if $\sigma&#x3D;\cos$ and is
equivalent to the Barron space when $\sigma&#x3D;{\rm ReLU}$. Our main result
establishes the precise asymptotics of the $L^2$-metric entropy of the unit
ball of these guage spaces and, as a consequence, the optimal approximation
rates for shallow ReLU$^k$ networks. The sharpest previous results hold only in
the special case that $k&#x3D;0$ and $d&#x3D;2$, where the metric entropy has been
determined up to logarithmic factors. When $k &gt; 0$ or $d &gt; 2$, there is a
significant gap between the previous best upper and lower bounds. We close all
of these gaps and determine the precise asymptotics of the metric entropy for
all $k \geq 0$ and $d\geq 2$, including removing the logarithmic factors
previously mentioned. Finally, we use these results to quantify how much is
lost by Barron&#x27;s spectral condition relative to the convex hull of
$\{\pm\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}$ when $\sigma&#x3D;{\rm ReLU}^k$. Finally, we also
show that the orthogonal greedy algorithm can algorithmically realize the
improved approximation rates which have been derived.</span>

                                        <span>Proteins structure prediction has long been a grand challenge over the past
50 years, owing to its board scientific and application interests. There are
two major types of modelling algorithm, template-free modelling and
template-based modelling, which is suitable for easy prediction tasks, and is
widely adopted in computer aided drug discoveries for drug design and
screening. Although it has been several decades since its first edition, the
current template-based modeling approach suffers from two important problems:
1) there are many missing regions in the template-query sequence alignment, and
2) the accuracy of the distance pairs from different regions of the template
varies, and this information is not well introduced into the modeling. To solve
the two problems, we propose a structural optimization process based on
template modelling, introducing two neural network models predict the distance
information of the missing regions and the accuracy of the distance pairs of
different regions in the template modeling structure. The predicted distances
and residue pairwise specific accuracy information are incorporated into the
potential energy function for structural optimization, which significantly
improves the qualities of the original template modelling decoys.</span>

                                        <span>For electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES) batteries, thermal runaway
is a critical issue as it can lead to uncontrollable fires or even explosions.
Thermal anomaly detection can identify problematic battery packs that may
eventually undergo thermal runaway. However, there are common challenges like
data unavailability, environment and configuration variations, and battery
aging. We propose a data-driven method to detect battery thermal anomaly based
on comparing shape-similarity between thermal measurements. Based on their
shapes, the measurements are continuously being grouped into different
clusters. Anomaly is detected by monitoring deviations within the clusters.
Unlike model-based or other data-driven methods, the proposed method is robust
to data loss and requires minimal reference data for different pack
configurations. As the initial experimental results show, the method not only
can be more accurate than the onboard BMS and but also can detect unforeseen
anomalies at the early stage.</span>

Oscillation (ENSO). However, current deep learning models are based on
convolutional neural networks which are difficult to interpret and can fail to
model large-scale atmospheric patterns. In comparison, graph neural networks
(GNNs) are capable of modeling large-scale spatial dependencies and are more
interpretable due to the explicit modeling of information flow through edge
connections. We propose the first application of graph neural networks to
seasonal forecasting. We design a novel graph connectivity learning module that
enables our GNN model to learn large-scale spatial interactions jointly with
the actual ENSO forecasting task. Our model, \graphino, outperforms
state-of-the-art deep learning-based models for forecasts up to six months
ahead. Additionally, we show that our model is more interpretable as it learns

                                        <span>Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad application
of artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues to be a poorly
understood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of work on catastrophic
forgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how exactly the phenomenon should
be quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when
designing learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use
various testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning
literature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern
gradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant
impact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that-surprisingly-in
many instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less
catastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We
empirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying
catastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning
systems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the
metric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to
change the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much
more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic
forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in
supervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics
concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must-at the
very least-be measured with pairwise interference.</span>

system such that its evolution fits observational data. The physical model can
subsequently be evolved into the future to make predictions. This principle is
a cornerstone of large scale forecasting applications such as numerical weather
prediction. As such, it is implemented in current operational systems of
weather forecasting agencies across the globe. However, finding a good initial
state poses a difficult optimization problem in part due to the non-invertible
relationship between physical states and their corresponding observations. We
learn a mapping from observational data to physical states and show how it can
be used to improve optimizability. We employ this mapping in two ways: to
better initialize the non-convex optimization problem, and to reformulate the
objective function in better behaved physics space instead of observation
space. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional
turbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves
forecast quality for chaotic systems.</span>

                                        <span>Tensor completion refers to the task of estimating the missing data from an
incomplete measurement or observation, which is a core problem frequently
arising from the areas of big data analysis, computer vision, and network
engineering. Due to the multidimensional nature of high-order tensors, the
matrix approaches, e.g., matrix factorization and direct matricization of
tensors, are often not ideal for tensor completion and recovery. In this paper,
we introduce a unified low-rank and sparse enhanced Tucker decomposition model
for tensor completion. Our model possesses a sparse regularization term to
promote a sparse core tensor of the Tucker decomposition, which is beneficial
for tensor data compression. Moreover, we enforce low-rank regularization terms
on factor matrices of the Tucker decomposition for inducing the low-rankness of
the tensor with a cheap computational cost. Numerically, we propose a
customized ADMM with enough easy subproblems to solve the underlying model. It
is remarkable that our model is able to deal with different types of real-world
data sets, since it exploits the potential periodicity and inherent correlation
properties appeared in tensors. A series of computational experiments on
real-world data sets, including internet traffic data sets, color images, and
face recognition, demonstrate that our model performs better than many existing
state-of-the-art matricization and tensorization approaches in terms of
achieving higher recovery accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>While deep reinforcement learning excels at solving tasks where large amounts
of data can be collected through virtually unlimited interaction with the
environment, learning from limited interaction remains a key challenge. We
posit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward
maximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual
input and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method,
Self-Predictive Representations(SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent
state representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target
representations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential
moving average of the agent&#x27;s parameters and we make predictions using a
learned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective
outperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further
improve performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss,
which forces the agent&#x27;s representations to be consistent across multiple views
of an observation. Our full self-supervised objective, which combines future
prediction and data augmentation, achieves a median human-normalized score of
0.415 on Atari in a setting limited to 100k steps of environment interaction,
which represents a 55% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.
Notably, even in this limited data regime, SPR exceeds expert human scores on 7
out of 26 games. The code associated with this work is available at

communication channel between the controller and the plant can be hijacked by a
malicious attacker. We assume the attacker learns the dynamics of the system
from observations, then overrides the controller&#x27;s actuation signal, while
mimicking legitimate operation by providing fictitious sensor readings to the
controller. On the other hand, the controller is on a lookout to detect the
presence of the attacker and tries to enhance the detection performance by
carefully crafting its control signals. We study the trade-offs between the
information acquired by the attacker from observations, the detection
capabilities of the controller, and the control cost. Specifically, we provide
tight upper and lower bounds on the expected $\epsilon$-deception time, namely
the time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the presence
of an attacker with confidence at least $(1-\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$. We then
show a probabilistic lower bound on the time that must be spent by the attacker
learning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected
$\epsilon$-deception time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in
the sense that if the attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning
algorithm with the given order expected deception time. Finally, we show a
lower bound on the expected energy expenditure required to guarantee detection
with confidence at least $1-\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon)$.</span>

performed in two ways: i) connecting words that have the same underlying

allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a

novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This

quantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the
intrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying
susceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue
susceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve
accuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch
between the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the
susceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning
architecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical
model, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the
relationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility
tensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The
convolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a
regularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by
ki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative
evaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed
deep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior

                                        <span>We consider the fundamental problem of communicating an estimate of a real
number $x\in[0,1]$ using a single bit. A sender that knows $x$ chooses a value
$X\in\set{0,1}$ to transmit. In turn, a receiver estimates $x$ based on the
value of $X$. We consider both the biased and unbiased estimation problems and
aim to minimize the cost. For the biased case, the cost is the worst-case (over
the choice of $x$) expected squared error, which coincides with the variance if
the algorithm is required to be unbiased.

We first overview common biased and unbiased estimation approaches and prove
their optimality when no shared randomness is allowed. We then show how a small
amount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the
cost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable
by any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose
near-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,
we discuss open problems and future directions.</span>

characteristic for symbolic music and is a challenge for modern generative
algorithms. It suggests a very simple workaround for this challenge, namely,
generation of a drum pattern that could be further used as a foundation for
melody generation. The paper presents a large dataset of drum patterns
alongside with corresponding melodies. It explores two possible methods for
drum pattern generation. Exploring a latent space of drum patterns one could
generate new drum patterns with a given music style. Finally, the paper
demonstrates that a simple artificial neural network could be trained to
generate melodies corresponding with these drum patters used as inputs.
Resulting system could be used for end-to-end generation of symbolic music with
song-like structure and higher long-scale correlations between the notes.</span>

that encode their local neighborhoods but not their positions. Consequently,
two nodes that are vastly distant but located in similar local neighborhoods
map to similar embeddings in those networks. This limitation prevents accurate
performance in predictive tasks that rely on position information. In this
paper,we develop GraphReach, a position-aware inductive GNN that captures the
global positions of nodes through reachability estimations with respect to a
set of anchor nodes. The anchors are strategically selected so that
reachability estimations across all the nodes are maximized. We show that this
combinatorial anchor selection problem is NP-hard and, consequently, develop a
greedy (1-1/e) approximation heuristic. Empirical evaluation against
state-of-the-art GNN architectures reveal that GraphReach provides up to 40%
relative improvement in accuracy. In addition, it is more robust to adversarial
attacks.</span>

                                        <span>With the explosive growth of e-commerce, online transaction fraud has become
one of the biggest challenges for e-commerce platforms. The historical
behaviors of users provide rich information for digging into the users&#x27; fraud
risk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a
long-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information
and provide explainable prediction results. In fact, the value variations of
same field from different events and the interactions of different fields
inside one event have proven to be strong indicators for fraudulent behaviors.
In this paper, we propose the Dual Importance-aware Factorization Machines
(DIFM), which exploits the internal field information among users&#x27; behavior
sequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field
interactions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed
in the risk management system of one of the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce
platforms, which utilize it to provide real-time transaction fraud detection.
Experimental results on real industrial data from different regions in the
platform clearly demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements
compared with various state-of-the-art baseline models. Moreover, the DIFM
could also give an insight into the explanation of the prediction results from
dual perspectives.</span>

                                        <span>Attention layers are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and are
beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large
transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once
trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,
it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.
This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.
Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query
projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables
heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of
parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query
dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and
vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained
multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.
Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query
projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.</span>

and academia, especially for computer vision tasks. The great success of deep
learning is mainly due to its scalability to encode large-scale data and to
maneuver billions of model parameters. However, it is a challenge to deploy
these cumbersome deep models on devices with limited resources, e.g., mobile
phones and embedded devices, not only because of the high computational
complexity but also the large storage requirements. To this end, a variety of
model compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As a
representative type of model compression and acceleration, knowledge
distillation effectively learns a small student model from a large teacher
model. It has received rapid increasing attention from the community. This
paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation from the
perspectives of knowledge categories, training schemes, teacher-student
architecture, distillation algorithms, performance comparison and applications.
Furthermore, challenges in knowledge distillation are briefly reviewed and
comments on future research are discussed and forwarded.</span>

neurons integrate inputs as an analog sum but communicate with spikes, binary
events in time. Analog neuromorphic hardware uses the same principles to
emulate spiking neural networks with exceptional energy-efficiency. However,
instantiating high-performing spiking networks on such hardware remains a
significant challenge due to device mismatch and the lack of efficient training
algorithms. Here, we introduce a general in-the-loop learning framework based
on surrogate gradients that resolves these issues. Using the BrainScaleS-2
neuromorphic system, we show that learning self-corrects for device mismatch
resulting in competitive spiking network performance on both vision and speech
benchmarks. Our networks display sparse spiking activity with, on average, far
less than one spike per hidden neuron and input, perform inference at rates of
up to 85 k frames/second, and consume less than 200 mW. In summary, our work
sets several new benchmarks for low-energy spiking network processing on analog
neuromorphic hardware and paves the way for future on-chip learning algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of the estimation of a high-dimensional probability
distribution from i.i.d. samples of the distribution using model classes of
functions in tree-based tensor formats, a particular case of tensor networks
associated with a dimension partition tree. The distribution is assumed to
admit a density with respect to a product measure, possibly discrete for
handling the case of discrete random variables.

After discussing the representation of classical model classes in tree-based
tensor formats, we present learning algorithms based on empirical risk
minimization using a $L^2$ contrast.

These algorithms exploit the multilinear parametrization of the formats to
recast the nonlinear minimization problem into a sequence of empirical risk
minimization problems with linear models. A suitable parametrization of the
tensor in tree-based tensor format allows to obtain a linear model with
orthogonal bases, so that each problem admits an explicit expression of the
solution and cross-validation risk estimates. These estimations of the risk
enable the model selection, for instance when exploiting sparsity in the
coefficients of the representation.

A strategy for the adaptation of the tensor format (dimension tree and
tree-based ranks) is provided, which allows to discover and exploit some
specific structures of high-dimensional probability distributions such as
independence or conditional independence.

We illustrate the performances of the proposed algorithms for the
approximation of classical probabilistic models (such as Gaussian distribution,
graphical models, Markov chain).</span>

However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks
tobe able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited
computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning
techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning
pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et
al. (2018) has shown promising results when pruning at initialization. However,
for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned
networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one
layer from being fully pruned. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of Magnitude and Gradient based pruning at initialization
and training of sparse architectures. This allows us to propose novel
principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of NN
architectures.</span>

                                        <span>Interactive news recommendation has been launched and attracted much
attention recently. In this scenario, user&#x27;s behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user&#x27;s preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user&#x27;s demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user&#x27;s interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.</span>

                                        <span>There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks
to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from human&#x27;s visual and intuitive perspective. We take
the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique
to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.
The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored
Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it
using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an
overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are
selected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the
effectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study
of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for
the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological
indices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception
augmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and
augmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology
study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.</span>

when fine-grained features or in our case rarely occurring anomalies are to be
detected. Current contributions point to the problem of how high-dimensional
data can be fused. In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data
description algorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using
three different fusion techniques i.e. early fusion, late fusion, and late
fusion with multiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with
a denoising process to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves
the performance (ROC AUC &#x3D; 80\%). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset
that consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple
perspectives, with 5\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g. drill
holes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset
using images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard
MNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
exceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on addressing
multi-perspective anomaly detection in images by jointly using different
perspectives together with one single objective function for anomaly detection.</span>

piece in benchmarking human trajectory prediction models. In order to gain a
better understanding of the complexity of trajectory prediction tasks and
following the intuition, that more complex datasets contain more information,
an approach for quantifying the amount of information contained in a dataset
from a prototype-based dataset representation is proposed. The dataset
representation is obtained by first employing a non-trivial spatial sequence
alignment, which enables a subsequent learning vector quantization (LVQ) stage.
A large-scale complexity analysis is conducted on several human trajectory
prediction benchmarking datasets, followed by a brief discussion on indications
for human trajectory prediction and benchmarking.</span>

                                        <span>Humans are highly efficient learners, with the ability to grasp the meaning
of a new concept from just a few examples. Unlike popular computer vision
systems, humans can flexibly leverage the compositional structure of the visual
world, understanding new concepts as combinations of existing concepts. In the
current paper, we study how people learn different types of visual
compositions, using abstract visual forms with rich relational structure. We
find that people can make meaningful compositional generalizations from just a
few examples in a variety of scenarios, and we develop a Bayesian program
induction model that provides a close fit to the behavioral data. Unlike past
work examining special cases of compositionality, our work shows how a single
computational approach can account for many distinct types of compositional
generalization.</span>

processing (NLP). The quality of word segmentation will directly affect the
rest of NLP tasks. Recently, with the artificial intelligence tide rising
again, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, as one of easily modeling
in sequence, has been widely utilized in various kinds of NLP tasks, and
functions well. Attention mechanism is an ingenious method to solve the memory
compression problem on LSTM. Furthermore, inspired by the powerful abilities of

propose a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Attention-based Model in this paper.

conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core
of $2.1$--$2.7$~GHz CPU on a real-time factor of $0.87$--$0.95$, including
input/output, feature extraction, on a frame shift of $10$ ms, a window length
of $27.5$ ms, and $2$ lookup frames.</span>

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users&#x27; demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.</span>

and symmetries can be done by deep learning. The constraints can be either
imposed as terms in a loss function or used to formulate a neural ansatz. In
the present case study, we calculate the induced field inside and outside a
dielectric cube placed in a uniform electric field, wherein the dielectric
mismatch at edges and corners of the cube makes accurate calculations
numerically challenging. The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz
incorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries
and the Laplace&#x27;s equation is then solved with boundary conditions at the
dielectric interface by minimizing a loss function. The loss function ensures
that both Laplace&#x27;s equation and boundary conditions are satisfied everywhere
inside a large solution domain. We study how the electric potential inside and
outside a quasi-cubic particle evolves through a sequence of shapes from a
sphere to a cube. The neural network being differentiable, it is
straightforward to calculate the electric field over the whole domain, the
induced surface charge distribution and the polarizability. The neural network
being retentive, one can efficiently follow how the field changes upon
particle&#x27;s shape or dielectric constant by iterating from any previously
converged solution. The present work&#x27;s objective is two-fold, first to show how
an a priori knowledge can be incorporated into neural networks to achieve
efficient learning and second to apply the method and study how the induced
field and polarizability change when a dielectric particle progressively
changes its shape from a sphere to a cube.</span>

vocoder framework based on multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction
for discrete waveform modeling (MWDLP). MWDLP employs a coarse-fine bit WaveRNN
architecture for 10-bit mu-law waveform modeling. A sparse gated recurrent unit
with a relatively large size of hidden units is utilized, while the multiband
modeling is deployed to achieve real-time low-latency usage. A novel technique
for data-driven linear prediction (LP) with discrete waveform modeling is
proposed, where the LP coefficients are estimated in a data-driven manner.
Moreover, a novel loss function using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for
discrete waveform modeling with Gumbel approximation is also proposed. The

high-fidelity synthetic speech for seen and unseen speakers and/or language on
300 speakers training data including clean and noisy/reverberant conditions,

to achieve strong performance, making the problem of Hyperparameter
Optimization (HPO) more important than ever. Here, we combine the advantages of
the popular bandit-based HPO method Hyperband (HB) and the evolutionary search
approach of Differential Evolution (DE) to yield a new HPO method which we call
DEHB. Comprehensive results on a very broad range of HPO problems, as well as a
wide range of tabular benchmarks from neural architecture search, demonstrate
that DEHB achieves strong performance far more robustly than all previous HPO
methods we are aware of, especially for high-dimensional problems with discrete
input dimensions. For example, DEHB is up to 1000x faster than random search.
It is also efficient in computational time, conceptually simple and easy to
implement, positioning it well to become a new default HPO method.</span>

challenging for time series due to the intractable marginal likelihoods of
flexible generative models. It can be addressed by surrogate objectives for
optimization. We propose Monte Carlo filtering objectives (MCFOs), a family of
variational objectives for jointly learning parametric generative models and
amortized adaptive importance proposals of time series. MCFOs extend the
choices of likelihood estimators beyond Sequential Monte Carlo in
state-of-the-art objectives, possess important properties revealing the factors
for the tightness of objectives, and allow for less biased and variant gradient
estimates. We demonstrate that the proposed MCFOs and gradient estimations lead
to efficient and stable model learning, and learned generative models well
explain data and importance proposals are more sample efficient on various
kinds of time series data.</span>

                                        <span>The technology for Visual Odometry (VO) that estimates the position and
orientation of the moving object through analyzing the image sequences captured
by on-board cameras, has been well investigated with the rising interest in
autonomous driving. This paper studies monocular VO from the perspective of
Deep Learning (DL). Unlike most current learning-based methods, our approach,
called DeepAVO, is established on the intuition that features contribute
discriminately to different motion patterns. Specifically, we present a novel
four-branch network to learn the rotation and translation by leveraging
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus on different quadrants of optical
flow input. To enhance the ability of feature selection, we further introduce
an effective channel-spatial attention mechanism to force each branch to
explicitly distill related information for specific Frame to Frame (F2F) motion
estimation. Experiments on various datasets involving outdoor driving and
indoor walking scenarios show that the proposed DeepAVO outperforms the
state-of-the-art monocular methods by a large margin, demonstrating competitive
performance to the stereo VO algorithm and verifying promising potential for
generalization.</span>

accelerating model inference. Yet existing GPUs can only leverage the sparsity
from weights but not activations, which are dynamic, unpredictable, and hence
challenging to exploit. In this work, we propose a novel architecture to
efficiently harness the dual-side sparsity (i.e., weight and activation
sparsity). We take a systematic approach to understand the (dis)advantages of
previous sparsity-related architectures and propose a novel, unexplored
paradigm that combines outer-product computation primitive and bitmap-based
encoding format. We demonstrate the feasibility of our design with minimal
changes to the existing production-scale inner-product-based Tensor Core. We
propose a set of novel ISA extensions and co-design the matrix-matrix
multiplication and convolution algorithms, which are the two dominant
computation patterns in today&#x27;s DNN models, to exploit our new dual-side sparse
Tensor Core. Our evaluation shows that our design can fully unleash the
dual-side DNN sparsity and improve the performance by up to one order of
magnitude with \hl{small} hardware overhead.</span>

                                        <span>The novel corona virus (Covid-19) has introduced significant challenges due
to its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,
there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease
diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective
radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a
sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep
leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that
utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt
models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training
dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the
transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging
domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this
circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network
(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR
images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits
important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using
graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is
not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of
extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three
class (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform
different benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned
drawbacks.</span>

tackles two commonly encountered problems in biomedical imaging: Topological
consistency of the segmentation, and limited annotations. We propose a
topological score which measures both topological and geometric consistency
between the predicted and ground truth segmentations, applied for model
selection and validation. We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.
a U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised
U-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training
the network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm. This allows us
to utilize un-annotated data for training a representation that generalizes
across test data variability, in spite of our annotated training data having
very limited variation. Our contributions are validated on a challenging
segmentation task, locating tubular structures in the fetal pancreas from noisy
live imaging confocal microscopy.</span>

                                        <span>The Graph Augmented Multi-layer Perceptron (GA-MLP) model is an attractive
alternative to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This is because it is resistant to
the over-smoothing problem, and deeper GA-MLP models yield better performance.
GA-MLP models are traditionally optimized by the Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD). However, SGD suffers from the layer dependency problem, which prevents
the gradients of different layers of GA-MLP models from being calculated in
parallel. In this paper, we propose a parallel deep learning Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (pdADMM) framework to achieve model
parallelism: parameters in each layer of GA-MLP models can be updated in
parallel. The extended pdADMM-Q algorithm reduces communication cost by
utilizing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a critical
point of the pdADMM algorithm and the pdADMM-Q algorithm is provided with a
sublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$. Extensive experiments in six benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the pdADMM can lead to high speedup, and outperforms
all the existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.</span>

                                        <span>The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is
strongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based
methods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved
cerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features
and are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background
clutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the
whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.

Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety
movement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from
short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative
information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy
screening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an
Australian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,
significantly outperforming existing competing methods with better
interpretability.</span>

the quality of life for the occupant via a variety of sensors and actuators
installed throughout the space. Many automated actions taken by a smart home
are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system.
However, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate and
therefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead a user to wonder
&quot;why did the smart home do that?&quot; In this work, we build on insights from
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to contribute
computational methods for explainable activity recognition. Specifically, we
generate explanations for smart home activity recognition systems that explain
what about an activity led to the given classification. To do so, we introduce
four computational techniques for generating natural language explanations of
smart home data and compare their effectiveness at generating meaningful
explanations. Through a study with everyday users, we evaluate user preferences
towards the four explanation types. Our results show that the leading approach,
SHAP, has a 92% success rate in generating accurate explanations. Moreover, 84%
of sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a
simple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity
recognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI
methods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying
activity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking
all studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding
which existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart
home automation, and discuss a range of topics for future work in this area.</span>

attractive tool for classification. We propose a novel distributed adaptive NN

proposed when searching for the optimal tuning parameter, which not only speeds

                                        <span>There has been a rise in the use of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)
Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and
algorithms, which otherwise take a huge amount of resources if built from
scratch. As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it&#x27;s very
important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have
only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of
vision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods
and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s optical
character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world
settings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and
Microsoft Azure&#x27;s Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the
conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and
transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These
methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such
attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for
high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully
evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision
(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).
90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the
vision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API&#x27;s
optical character recognition. Complementing to current research, our results
provide simple but unconventional methods on robustness evaluation.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we consider the linear programming (LP) formulation for deep
reinforcement learning. The number of the constraints depends on the size of
state and action spaces, which makes the problem intractable in large or
continuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the
double-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional
expectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic
penalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling
and evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the
obstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the
intractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep
parameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the
replacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the
augmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general
theoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the
constrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the
error is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty
algorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be
arbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is
chosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is
competitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Real-time visual localization of needles is necessary for various surgical
applications, including surgical automation and visual feedback. In this study
we investigate localization and autonomous robotic control of needles in the
context of our magneto-suturing system. Our system holds the potential for
surgical manipulation with the benefit of minimal invasiveness and reduced
patient side effects. However, the non-linear magnetic fields produce
unintuitive forces and demand delicate position-based control that exceeds the
capabilities of direct human manipulation. This makes automatic needle
localization a necessity. Our localization method combines neural network-based
segmentation and classical techniques, and we are able to consistently locate
our needle with 0.73 mm RMS error in clean environments and 2.72 mm RMS error
in challenging environments with blood and occlusion. The average localization
RMS error is 2.16 mm for all environments we used in the experiments. We
combine this localization method with our closed-loop feedback control system
to demonstrate the further applicability of localization to autonomous control.
Our needle is able to follow a running suture path in (1) no blood, no tissue;
(2) heavy blood, no tissue; (3) no blood, with tissue; and (4) heavy blood,
with tissue environments. The tip position tracking error ranges from 2.6 mm to
3.7 mm RMS, opening the door towards autonomous suturing tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Distantly supervised (DS) relation extraction (RE) has attracted much
attention in the past few years as it can utilize large-scale auto-labeled
data. However, its evaluation has long been a problem: previous works either
took costly and inconsistent methods to manually examine a small sample of
model predictions, or directly test models on auto-labeled data -- which, by
our check, produce as much as 53% wrong labels at the entity pair level in the
popular NYT10 dataset. This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,
but also made it hard to understand where we are and what&#x27;s left to improve in
the research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we
build manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,
and thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest
pre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can
indicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some
unexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating
performance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to
previous methods. We hope that both our manual test sets and novel observations
can help advance future DS-RE research.</span>

fundamental task in data science is to learn a Bayesian network from observed

of coronary heart disease (CHD) at an earlier stage can greatly reduce the
mortality rate. We use 64 two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography
(2D-STE) features and seven clinical features to predict whether one has CHD.
Methods: We develop a machine learning approach that integrates a number of
popular classification methods together by model stacking, and generalize the
traditional stacking method to a two-step stacking method to improve the
diagnostic performance. Results: By borrowing strengths from multiple
classification models through the proposed method, we improve the CHD
classification accuracy from around 70% to 87.7% on the testing set. The
sensitivity of the proposed method is 0.903 and the specificity is 0.843, with
an AUC of 0.904, which is significantly higher than those of the individual
classification models. Conclusions: Our work lays a foundation for the
deployment of speckle tracking echocardiography-based screening tools for
coronary heart disease.</span>

many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.</span>

many organizations offer neural-networks based services as a black-box. The
reasons for hiding a learning model may vary: e.g., preventing copying of its
behavior or keeping back an adversarial from reverse-engineering its mechanism
and revealing sensitive information about its training data.

However, even as a black-box, some information can still be discovered by

                                        <span>Traditionally, Hawkes processes are used to model time--continuous point
processes with history dependence. Here we propose an extended model where the
self--effects are of both excitatory and inhibitory type and follow a Gaussian
Process. Whereas previous work either relies on a less flexible
parameterization of the model, or requires a large amount of data, our
formulation allows for both a flexible model and learning when data are scarce.
We continue the line of work of Bayesian inference for Hawkes processes, and
our approach dispenses with the necessity of estimating a branching structure
for the posterior, as we perform inference on an aggregated sum of Gaussian
Processes. Efficient approximate Bayesian inference is achieved via data
augmentation, and we describe a mean--field variational inference approach to
learn the model parameters. To demonstrate the flexibility of the model we
apply our methodology on data from three different domains and compare it to
previously reported results.</span>

human-like behavior is the need to quickly and accurately quantify
human-likeness. While human assessments of such behavior can be highly
accurate, speed and scalability are limited. We address these limitations
through a novel automated Navigation Turing Test (ANTT) that learns to predict
human judgments of human-likeness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
automated NTT on a navigation task in a complex 3D environment. We investigate
six classification models to shed light on the types of architectures best
suited to this task, and validate them against data collected through a human
NTT. Our best models achieve high accuracy when distinguishing true human and
agent behavior. At the same time, we show that predicting finer-grained human
assessment of agents&#x27; progress towards human-like behavior remains unsolved.
Our work takes an important step towards agents that more effectively learn

                                        <span>In recent years, abstractive text summarization with multimodal inputs has
started drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from
different source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,
existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as
the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long
ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to
generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce
AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with
videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic
conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding
research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and
uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\name}, a factorized
multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently
captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input
modalities for the text summarization task. {\name} utilizes an increasing
number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly
better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments
illustrate that {\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for
short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse
duration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$

of symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations
(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical
SAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian
distribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel
data-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their
discretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data
compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss
and mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented
for high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is
shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic
process that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate
piecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional
information loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed
representations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX
method. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets
demonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an
alternative data-driven SAX variant.</span>

of a new field of studying privacy-preserving machine learning from isolated
data sources, i.e., \textit{federated learning}. Vertical federated learning,
where different parties hold different features for common users, has a great
potential of driving a more variety of business cooperation among enterprises
in different fields. Decision tree models especially decision tree ensembles
are a class of widely applied powerful machine learning models with high
interpretability and modeling efficiency. However, the interpretability are
compromised in these works such as SecureBoost since the feature names are not
exposed to avoid possible data breaches due to the unprotected decision path.
In this paper, we shall propose Fed-EINI, an efficient and interpretable
inference framework for federated decision tree models with only one round of
multi-party communication. We shall compute the candidate sets of leaf nodes
based on the local data at each party in parallel, followed by securely
computing the weight of the only leaf node in the intersection of the candidate
sets. We propose to protect the decision path by the efficient additively
homomorphic encryption method, which allows the disclosure of feature names and
thus makes the federated decision trees interpretable. The advantages of
Fed-EINI will be demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive
numerical results. Experiments show that the inference efficiency is improved
by over $50\%$ in average.</span>

                                        <span>Entanglement is a physical phenomenon, which has fueled recent successes of
quantum algorithms. Although quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown
promising results in solving simple machine learning tasks recently, for the
time being, the effect of entanglement in QNNs and the behavior of QNNs in
binary pattern classification are still underexplored. In this work, we provide
some theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and
analyzing a new form of invariance embedded in QNNs for both quantum binary
classification and quantum representation learning, which we term negational
symmetry. Given a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart where a
bitwise NOT operation is applied to each quantum bit of the binary signal, a
QNN outputs the same logits. That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a
quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification
task. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary
pattern classification tasks using Google&#x27;s quantum computing framework. The
theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a
fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our
findings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in
practical quantum applications.</span>

Consequently, we show that, near a local or global minimum, the stationary
distribution $P_\mathrm{ss}(\theta)$ of the network parameters $\theta$ follows
a power-law with respect to the loss function $L(\theta)$, i.e.
$P_\mathrm{ss}(\theta)\propto L(\theta)^{-\phi}$ with the exponent $\phi$
specified by the mini-batch size, the learning rate, and the Hessian at the
minimum. We obtain the escape rate formula from a local minimum, which is
determined not by the loss barrier height $\Delta L&#x3D;L(\theta^s)-L(\theta^*)$
between a minimum $\theta^*$ and a saddle $\theta^s$ but by the logarithmized
loss barrier height $\Delta\log L&#x3D;\log[L(\theta^s)/L(\theta^*)]$. Our
escape-rate formula explains an empirical fact that SGD prefers flat minima
with low effective dimensions.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new type of neural networks, Kronecker neural networks (KNNs),
that form a general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation
functions. KNNs employ the Kronecker product, which provides an efficient way
of constructing a very wide network while keeping the number of parameters low.
Our theoretical analysis reveals that under suitable conditions, KNNs induce a
faster decay of the loss than that by the feed-forward networks. This is also
empirically verified through a set of computational examples. Furthermore,
under certain technical assumptions, we establish global convergence of
gradient descent for KNNs. As a specific case, we propose the Rowdy activation
function that is designed to get rid of any saturation region by injecting
sinusoidal fluctuations, which include trainable parameters. The proposed Rowdy
activation function can be employed in any neural network architecture like
feed-forward neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Convolutional neural
networks etc. The effectiveness of KNNs with Rowdy activation is demonstrated
through various computational experiments including function approximation
using feed-forward neural networks, solution inference of partial differential
equations using the physics-informed neural networks, and standard deep
learning benchmark problems using convolutional and fully-connected neural
networks.</span>

the current COVID-19 infections rapidly change the economic environment. In
such a situation, the importance of real-time economic analysis using

data are closer to real-time and richer than official statistics that are
typically released once a month in an aggregated form. We take advantage of

real-world problem; prediction of the number of job applicants which is closely

                                        <span>Predicting links in complex networks has been one of the essential topics
within the realm of data mining and science discovery over the past few years.
This problem remains an attempt to identify future, deleted, and redundant
links using the existing links in a graph. Local random walk is considered to
be one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local
methods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a
limited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step
among the nodes which have equal importance. Then this method uses the
transition probability between node pairs to calculate the similarity between
them. However, in most datasets, this method is not able to perform accurately
in scoring remarkably similar nodes. In the present article, an efficient
method is proposed for improving local random walk by encouraging random walk
to move, in every step, towards the node which has a stronger influence.
Therefore, the next node is selected according to the influence of the source
node. To do so, using mutual information, the concept of the asymmetric mutual
influence of nodes is presented. A comparison between the proposed method and
other similarity-based methods (local, quasi-local, and global) has been
performed, and results have been reported for 11 real-world networks. It had a
higher prediction accuracy compared with other link prediction approaches.</span>

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an
emphasis on the quality of non-English language directions. Our intuition is
based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose \method, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mCOLT is empowered by two techniques: (i) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and (ii) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mCOLT achieves
competitive or even better performance than a strong pre-trained model mBART on
tens of WMT benchmarks. For non-English directions, mCOLT achieves an
improvement of average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Knowing the uncertainty in a prediction is critical when making expensive
investment decisions and when patient safety is paramount, but machine learning
(ML) models in drug discovery typically provide only a single best estimate and
ignore all sources of uncertainty. Predictions from these models may therefore
be over-confident, which can put patients at risk and waste resources when
compounds that are destined to fail are further developed. Probabilistic
predictive models (PPMs) can incorporate uncertainty in both the data and
model, and return a distribution of predicted values that represents the
uncertainty in the prediction. PPMs not only let users know when predictions
are uncertain, but the intuitive output from these models makes communicating
risk easier and decision making better. Many popular machine learning methods
have a PPM or Bayesian analogue, making PPMs easy to fit into current
workflows. We use toxicity prediction as a running example, but the same
principles apply for all prediction models used in drug discovery. The
consequences of ignoring uncertainty and how PPMs account for uncertainty are
also described. We aim to make the discussion accessible to a broad
non-mathematical audience. Equations are provided to make ideas concrete for
mathematical readers (but can be skipped without loss of understanding) and
code is available for computational researchers

                                        <span>In this work, an efficient physics-constrained deep learning model is
developed for solving multiphase flow in 3D heterogeneous porous media. The
model fully leverages the spatial topology predictive capability of
convolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient
continuity-based smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial
continuity. Furthermore, the transient regions are penalized to steer the
training process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these
regions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid
properties and well controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of
the state variables (pressure and saturation). While maintaining the continuity
of fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing
training cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training
data samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is
separately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on
the predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the
example of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the
physics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based
simulation data and emulates the physics process. The model performs prediction
with a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the
average temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%
and 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently
predicted by a surrogate model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than
5%. Therefore, with its unique scheme to cope with the fidelity in fluid flow
in porous media, the physics-constrained deep learning model can become an
efficient predictive model for computationally demanding inverse problems or
other coupled processes.</span>

and carbon dioxide (CO2) plume migration under geologic uncertainties is a
challenging problem in geologic carbon storage. The high computational cost of
data assimilation with a high-dimensional parameter space impedes fast
decision-making for commercial-scale reservoir management. We propose to
leverage physical understandings of porous medium flow behavior with deep
learning techniques to develop a fast history matching-reservoir response
forecasting workflow. Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation
framework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir
performance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes
interpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive
component in such a workflow is reservoir simulation, we developed surrogate
models to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well
injection. The surrogate models employ deep convolutional neural networks,
specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is
validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a
clastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to
bridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a
single-layer reservoir model. The workflow can complete history matching and
reservoir forecasting with uncertainty quantification in less than one hour on
a mainstream personal workstation.</span>

without quick medical intervention would lower the chances of survival for the
elderly, especially if living alone. Hence, the need is there for developing
fall detection algorithms with high accuracy. This paper presents a novel
IoT-based system for fall detection that includes a sensing device transmitting
data to a mobile application through a cloud-connected gateway device. Then,
the focus is shifted to the algorithmic aspect where multiple features are
extracted from 3-axis accelerometer data taken from existing datasets. The
results emphasize on the significance of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) as
an influential feature for determining falls. CWT, Signal Energy (SE), Signal
Magnitude Area (SMA), and Signal Vector Magnitude (SVM) features have shown
promising classification results using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and E-Nearest
Neighbors (ENN). For all performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision,
specificity, and F1 Score), the achieved results are higher than 95% for a

                                        <span>Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research
interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation -- describing a shape as
a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point
clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used
in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential
and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for
existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and
natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.
We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and
random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset
consisting of 179,133 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made
this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.</span>

                                        <span>Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often
carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the
image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat
image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,
specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these
superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model
that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial
information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with
relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is
learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a &#x60;hybrid&#x27; loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:
COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint
Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel
information provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard
CNN-based vision systems.</span>

                                        <span>Non-stationary environments are challenging for reinforcement learning
algorithms. If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on
latent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that
maximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.
We call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions
such as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of
pre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or
boundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns
policies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream
of data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection
statistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created
and deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones
might be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until
unforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid
responses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in
order to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a
(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model
the different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We
evaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning
problems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and
model-based) RL algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art meta-learning methods
specially designed to deal with non-stationarity.</span>

                                        <span>The past decades have witnessed the prosperity of graph mining, with a
multitude of sophisticated models and algorithms designed for various mining
tasks, such as ranking, classification, clustering and anomaly detection.
Generally speaking, the vast majority of the existing works aim to answer the
following question, that is, given a graph, what is the best way to mine it? In
this paper, we introduce the graph sanitation problem, to answer an orthogonal
question. That is, given a mining task and an initial graph, what is the best
way to improve the initially provided graph? By learning a better graph as part
of the input of the mining model, it is expected to benefit graph mining in a
variety of settings, ranging from denoising, imputation to defense. We
formulate the graph sanitation problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and
further instantiate it by semi-supervised node classification, together with an
effective solver named GaSoliNe. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method is (1) broadly applicable with respect to different
graph neural network models and flexible graph modification strategies, (2)
effective in improving the node classification accuracy on both the original
and contaminated graphs in various perturbation scenarios. In particular, it
brings up to 25% performance improvement over the existing robust graph neural
network methods.</span>

The research on retinal vessel segmentation focuses mainly on improvement of
the segmentation model which is usually based on U-Net architecture. In our
study we use the U-Net architecture and we rely on heavy data augmentation in
order to achieve better performance. The success of the data augmentation
relies on successfully addressing the problem of input images. By analyzing
input images and performing the augmentation accordingly we show that the
performance of the U-Net model can be increased dramatically. Results are
reported using the most widely used retina dataset, DRIVE.</span>

to avoid obstacles, especially with developments in tires, suspensions,
steering, as well as safety technologies like ABS, ESC, and more recently, ADAS
systems. However, environments around passenger vehicles have also become more
complex, and dangerous. There have previously been studies that outline driver
tendencies and performance capabilities when attempting to avoid obstacles
while driving passenger vehicles. Now that autonomous vehicles are being
developed with obstacle avoidance capabilities, it is important to target
performance that meets or exceeds that of human drivers. This manuscript
highlights systems that are crucial for an emergency obstacle avoidance
maneuver (EOAM) and identifies the state-of-the-art for each of the related
systems, while considering the nuances of traveling at highway speeds. Some of
the primary EOAM-related systems/areas that are discussed in this review are:
general path planning methods, system hierarchies, decision-making, trajectory
generation, and trajectory-tracking control methods. After concluding remarks,
suggestions for future work which could lead to an ideal EOAM development, are
discussed.</span>

                                        <span>Over the past decade, many approaches have been introduced for traffic speed
prediction. However, providing fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and
adaptive traffic speed prediction for a growing transportation network where
the size of the network keeps increasing and new traffic detectors are
constantly deployed has not been well studied. To address this issue, this
paper presents DistTune based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the
Nelder-Mead method. Whenever encountering an unprocessed detector, DistTune
decides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the
detector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic
speed patterns they have observed. If similarity is found, DistTune directly
shares an existing LSTM model with this detector to achieve time-efficient
processing. Otherwise, DistTune customizes an LSTM model for the detector to
achieve fine-grained prediction. To make DistTune even more time-efficient,
DistTune performs on a cluster of computing nodes in parallel. To achieve
adaptive traffic speed prediction, DistTune also provides LSTM re-customization
for detectors that suffer from unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to for
instance traffic speed pattern change. Extensive experiments based on traffic
data collected from freeway I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the
performance of DistTune. The results demonstrate that DistTune provides
fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and adaptive traffic speed prediction
for a growing transportation network.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training among mutually
distrusting parties. Model updates, rather than training data, are concentrated
and fused in a central aggregation server. A key security challenge in FL is
that an untrustworthy or compromised aggregation process might lead to
unforeseeable information leakage. This challenge is especially acute due to
recently demonstrated attacks that have reconstructed large fractions of
training data from ostensibly &quot;sanitized&quot; model updates.

In this paper, we introduce TRUDA, a new cross-silo FL system, employing a
trustworthy and decentralized aggregation architecture to break down
information concentration with regard to a single aggregator. Based on the
unique computational properties of model-fusion algorithms, all exchanged model
updates in TRUDA are disassembled at the parameter-granularity and re-stitched
to random partitions designated for multiple TEE-protected aggregators. Thus,
each aggregator only has a fragmentary and shuffled view of model updates and
is oblivious to the model architecture. Our new security mechanisms can
fundamentally mitigate training reconstruction attacks, while still preserving
the final accuracy of trained models and keeping performance overheads low.</span>

have performed audio data augmentation and addressed data imbalance using
SMOTE. Our data indicate that optimised SVM outperforms MLP with an accuracy of

Our final exploration indicated that the performance of both SVM and MLP were

predict risk in value-based care for incorporation into CMS Innovation Center
payment and service delivery models. Recently, modern language models have
played key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to

Moreover, we propose a comprehensive modeling solution centered on a deep

recall on readmission classification. We also introduce a novel data

                                        <span>With the advent of big data across multiple high-impact applications, we are
often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data
usually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,
thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although
state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with
sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to
obtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these
techniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich
unlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified
heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple
types of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the
proposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual
information of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the
hidden representation of two views of the same sample. Experimental results on
real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the
proposed method modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.</span>

critical to their success in real-world applications. However, when taken to
the extreme, methods that promote robustness can hurt the model&#x27;s sensitivity
to rare or underrepresented patterns. In this paper, we discuss this trade-off
between sensitivity and robustness to natural (non-adversarial) perturbations
by introducing two notions: contextual feature utility and contextual feature
sensitivity. We propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) that encourages a
model to be more sensitive to the features that have higher contextual utility.
Empirical results demonstrate that models trained with FCL achieve a better
balance of robustness and sensitivity, leading to improved generalization in
the presence of noise on both vision and NLP datasets.</span>

predict both the presence of diabetes and the presence of undiagnosed diabetes
using eight years of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
data. Models are tuned and compared via their Brier Scores. The most relevant
variables of the best performing models are then compared. A Support Vector
Machine with a linear kernel performed best for predicting diabetes, returning
a Brier score of 0.0654 and an AUROC of 0.9235 on the test set. An elastic net
regression performed best for predicting undiagnosed diabetes with a Brier
score of 0.0294 and an AUROC of 0.9439 on the test set. Similar features appear
prominently in the models for both sets of models. Blood osmolality, family
history, the prevalance of various compounds, and hypertension are key
indicators for all diabetes risk. For undiagnosed diabetes in particular, there
are ethnicity or genetic components which arise as strong correlates as well.</span>

                                        <span>While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation
has recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,
existing approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were
gathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily
outfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the
demonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning
for vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this
work, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the
Imitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a
robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we
introduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for
Autonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies
from a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.
We evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA
not only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation
policies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a
wheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment
using a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.</span>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning enables multiple users to build a joint model by sharing
their model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their
devices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,
we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.
Specifically, we propose Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to
extract the labels of the users&#x27; training data from their shared gradients. The
attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the
presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of
leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well
to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and
mathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings.
Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with
high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different
defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.</span>

                                        <span>The joint task of bug localization and program repair is an integral part of
the software development process. In this work we present DeepDebug, an
approach to automated debugging using large, pretrained transformers. We begin
by training a bug-creation model on reversed commit data for the purpose of
generating synthetic bugs. We apply these synthetic bugs toward two ends.
First, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K
repositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute
tests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that
are covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information
such as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model
which was pretrained on raw source code. Finally, we strengthen all our models
by expanding the context window beyond the buggy function itself, and adding a
skeleton consisting of that function&#x27;s parent class, imports, signatures,
docstrings, and method bodies, in order of priority. On the QuixBugs benchmark,
we increase the total number of fixes found by over 50%, while also decreasing
the false positive rate from 35% to 5% and decreasing the timeout from six
hours to one minute. On our own benchmark of executable tests, our model fixes
68% of all bugs on its first attempt without using traces, and after adding
traces it fixes 75% on first attempt. We will open-source our framework and
validation set for evaluating on executable tests.</span>

large scale dataset against a query image. Generally, the similarity between
the representative features of the query image and dataset images is used to
rank the images for retrieval. In early days, various hand designed feature
descriptors have been investigated based on the visual cues such as color,
texture, shape, etc. that represent the images. However, the deep learning has
emerged as a dominating alternative of hand-designed feature engineering from a
decade. It learns the features automatically from the data. This paper presents
a comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade
for content based image retrieval. The categorization of existing
state-of-the-art methods from different perspectives is also performed for
greater understanding of the progress. The taxonomy used in this survey covers
different supervision, different networks, different descriptor type and
different retrieval type. A performance analysis is also performed using the
state-of-the-art methods. The insights are also presented for the benefit of
the researchers to observe the progress and to make the best choices. The
survey presented in this paper will help in further research progress in image
retrieval using deep learning.</span>

                                        <span>The exponential rise of online social media has enabled the creation,
distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However,
it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing
cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of
its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like
racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a
machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the
first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online
antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting
signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling
multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any
publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect
and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and
Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that
detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism
category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of
experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.</span>
